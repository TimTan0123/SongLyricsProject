0,Timbuk 3,Life Is Hard,TRTQDAY128F92D5383,1986,"Betty's in a wet T-shirt, feeling foolish and vain
Looking like some house cat that got caught out in the rain
Staring into the mirror at this less-than-pretty picture
Feeling ten years older now, and fifty bucks richer
 
Life is hard
Can't buy happiness no matter what you do
Can't get to heaven on roller skates
Can't take a taxi cab to Timbuktu
 
Paul was a poor little rich boy, he never had to cry
Whenever he complained of aches and pains, the doctors would drop by
Now he goes to parlors with the prettiest girls in town
Get paid five hundred dollars just to kick him when he's down
 
Life is hard
Can't buy happiness no matter what you do
Can't get to heaven on roller skates
Can't take a taxi cab to Timbuktu

Life is hard
Life is hard
Life is hard
Can't buy happiness no matter what you do
Can't get to heaven on roller skates
Can't take a taxi cab to Timbuktu

After he stiffed a waitress, and ran out on his tab
Big Mac had a heart attack in the back of a yellow cab
By the time the sound of the siren said the ambulance was comin'
His heart had stopped beatin', but the meter was still runnin'
 
Life is hard
Can't buy happiness no matter what you do
Can't get to heaven on roller skates
Can't take a taxi cab to Timbuktu

Life is hard
Life is hard
Life is hard
Ain't no escaping when the rent comes due
Can't get to heaven on roller skates
Can't take a taxi cab to Timbuktu"
1,Georgia Satellites,Over And Over (LP Version),TRTXYGD12903CEEC37,1986,"Well what is the pain when the pain don't show
Poor Richard shoutin' out go man go
Hi ho silver-o take me away
On the arms of a dream I'll never find my way

Well over and over the tear that never mends
Over and over, over and over again

Well hell yes baby, hell no
What does it matter Wanda I don't know
Nothing forgiven nothing forgot
You can tell me it the truth but I know that it's not

Well over and over, the tear that never mends
Over and over, over and over again

Well over and over, it's the tear that never mends  
Over and over, over and over again

Well I said, over and over, the tear that never mends
Over and over, over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again"

3,Clarence Carter,Strokin',TRGWHWK128F428C9F4,1986,"When I start makin' love 
I don't just make love
I be strokin' 
That's what I be doin', huh 
I be strokin' 

I stroke it to the east 
And I stroke it to the west 
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best 
I be strokin' 

Let me ask you somethin'
What time of the day do you like to make love?
Have you ever made love just before breakfast?
Have you ever made love while you watched the late, late show?
Well, let me ask you this 
Have you ever made love on a couch?
Well, let me ask you this 
Have you ever made love on the back seat of a car?
I remember one time I made love on the back seat of a car 
And the police came and shined his light on me, and I said: 
""I'm strokin', that's what I'm doin', I be strokin""

I stroke it to the east 
And I stroke it to the west 
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best 
I be strokin' 

Let me ask you something
How long has it been since you made love, huh? 
Did you make love yesterday?
Did you make love last week?
Did you make love last year?
Or maybe it might be that you plannin' on makin' love tonight 
But just remember, when you start making love 
You make it hard, long, soft, short 
And be strokin' 
I be strokin' 

I stroke it to the east 
And I stroke it to the west 
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best, huh 
I be strokin' 

Now when I start making love to my woman 
I don't stop until I know she's sas-ified 
And I can always tell when she gets sas-ified 
'Cause when she gets sas-fied she start calling my name 
She'd say: ""Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter 
Clarence Carter, ooh shit, Clarence Carter"" 
The other night I was strokin' my woman 
And it got so good to her, you know what she told me 
Let me tell you what she told me, she said: 
""Stroke it, Clarence Carter, but don't stroke so fast 
If my stuff ain't tight enough, you can stick it up my...""
Whoo! 

I be strokin'
Ha ha ha ha
I be strokin' 

I stroke it to the east 
And I stroke it to the west 
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best, huh 
I be strokin' 
I be strokin'
Ha ha ha ha
I be strokin', yeah! 
I be strokin' 

I stroke it to the north 
I stroke it to the south 
I stroke it everywhere 
I even stroke it with my
Whoo!

I be strokin' 
I be strokin'
Ha ha

4,Luther Vandross,I Gave It Up (When I Fell In Love),TRDQIQL128F427AE32,1986,"I GAVE IT UP (WHEN I FELL IN LOVE)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller
(album: GIVE ME THE REASON - 1986)

My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

Chorus:
See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love
I used to know the party people around the world
I gave it up when I found that girl
And she's the one treats me good enough
So I gave it up when I fell in love

I thought I was justified
To only see the world through my eyes
And that it was a waste of time talkin' 'bout love
But it only took a little time to make change my mind
'Cause when she said goodbye
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Now, every night I dream about you and our new love
All of my friends say I'm such a different guy
And they wonder
Oh, how they wonder

Ad lib
I gave it up
Sho' nuff gave it up
That was all I was thinking of
But I gave it up when I fell in love

5,The Moody Blues,I Just Don't Care,TRFNOQO128E07935B1,1986,"The indestructible has broken down
The undeniable is turned around
And I don't care my love
I just don't care
I love you

The unbelievable has all come true
I love the changes that you've put me through
And I don't care you see
I just don't care
I love you

I see the magic that we're making now
And a veil is lifted from my eyes somehow
And the most amazing thing that comes to light
Is the world looks different
To me overnight

My friends will tell you
That I've lost my cool
The lovesick schoolboy
Turning up for school
But I don't care, you know
I just don't care
I love you

I see the magic
That we're making now
And a veil is lifted
From my eyes somehow
And the most amazing thing
That comes to light
Is the world looks different
To me overnight

My friends will tell you
That I've lost my cool

6,Hallows Eve,Plea of the Aged,TRAQNMV128F934AB8B,1986,"Death is drawing closer I'm fighting for my life
I know not how to stop it live through this pain and strife
Awakened in the nighttime I'm fighting for my life
Death is drawing nearer I'll soon be cold as ice
No longer do I trifle bones growing too old
Death longing to reach and grasp my unrelenting soul
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace

Remember me, hear my plea time's drawing nigh for me to die
Remember me, hear my plea take from this heart the bitter part
The world they will destroy me or put me in the ground
Stand around my gravesite with their heads all hanging down
When I'm lying at my rest they'll look upon my face
Cry their tears of dreadful mourn in their weakened daily pace
Staring at the ceiling the tubes glow in the dark
Fearless thoughts invade my head to tear my mind apart
Trapped within this feeling I feel it deep inside
Knock of death upon my door and I've no will to hide

Take from me my very soul with wretched mourning death
Take mine eyes for I have seen the hell in which we live
Take now from one man on earth who loved this life so much
Take away everything for it's all cold to the touch
Remember me, hear my plea soon the darkness I will see
Remember me, hear my plea for now another..."
7,Randy Travis,There'll Always Be A Honky Tonk Somewhere (Album Version),TRNWWDJ128F92FE72F,1986,"There may no be a Superbowl in 2083
Cars and trains and video games will all be history
The world just keeps on changing, things come and then they go
Nothing lasts forever except one thing I know

There'll always be a honky tonk
With a jukebox in the corner
And someone crying in their beer
And one old hanger-oner
And a lady looking lonely
From a losing love affair
Yeah there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere
Yeah there'll always be a honky tonk somewhere

There may be factories on the moon and farming out in space
It seems there's nothing here on earth
That something won't replace
But as long as there's a broken heart there'll be a place to go
Where good ole boys meet good ole girls
And the wine and music flow"
8,This Mortal Coil,Morning Glory,TRKXDEC128F428E26A,1986,"I lit my purest candle close to my
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Of any vagabond who passed it by
And I waited in my fleeting house

Before he came I felt him drawing near
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
That he had come to wound my door and jeer
And I waited in my fleeting house

""Tell me stories,"" I called to the Hobo;
""Stories of cold,"" I smiled at the Hobo;
""Stories of old,"" I knelt to the Hobo;
And he stood before my fleeting house

""No,"" said the Hobo, ""No more tales of time;
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,""
And he walked away from my fleeting house#

""Then you be damned!"" I screamed to the Hobo;
""Leave me alone,"" I wept to the Hobo;
""Turn into stone,"" I knelt to the Hobo;
And he walked away from my fleeting house"

10,It Bites,I Got You Eating Out Of My Hand,TRSRSJE128F423110F,1986,"Did you really  think  I'd fall for that
Did you think  you'd brought me luck
Sitting with the money such a honey with the glamour talk
Holding out my heart I hoped you'd pick a joker for me
You're never far always on my shoulder
What's Good for you always seems to be good for me
Lady, Lady
I Got You  I've got you eating out of my hand
I Got You  I've got you eating out of my hand
DId you really think I spoke the truth
Sitting with the money thought it funny well I'm no super spy
Brought you along  you looked like a proffesional to me
Knew all along You could never fall for me
Out of the blue  another mystery

Qui croit connaître
Pour toutes celles qui m'ont pas vu naître
Y restait chez moi
Même tout nu
Un peu d'inconnu

Bol de mousse
Chorus de larmes
Figaro nouveau fait ses gammes
Encore un mystère de paris éclairci

Encore un rideau qui se lève
After shave

Flocon blanc flacon chic
Mélangé lavande et colchiques
Oublié pourquoi les douleurs
Les jolies rougeurs
Duvet de satin tendre écorce
Même si tu danses au crazy horse
Personne saura de quel côté
Ma joue t'a frottée

C'est une histoire d'eau qui s'achève
After shave

Mais si je te prends sur les traces
De n'importe quel barbu qui passe
J'irai me faire raser chez Gainsbourg jusqu'à ton retour

Tristesse en coeur douceur en grève
After shave

Tristesse en coeur douceur en grève

Oh tristesse

Tristesse en coeur douceur en grève

Tristesse en coeur douceur en grève

Tristesse en coeur douceur en grève"

After making love with you
I'm breaking the walls down

Those who can be strong
From watching us all
Needed a song

You filled a hole in my heart
You took the weight off my shoulders right from the start
You filled a hole in my heart
You took the weight off my shoulders right from the start
Yes you did yes you did

You were my religion
I meditate on you
I forget myself when
I know what love can do
Those who can be strong
From watching us all
Needed a song

Those who can be strong
From watching us all
Needed a song

You filled a hole in my heart

Filled a hole in my heart
You took the weight off my shoulders"

Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go

Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone

Heading into twilight
Spreading out her wings tonight
She got you jumping off the deck
And shoving into overdrive

Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you right into the danger zone

They'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Oh, yeah!

Out along the edges
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone

Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone"

22,Iron Maiden,Alexander The Great (356-323 BC) (1998 Digital Remaster),TRANNGA128F147CC21,1986,"== My son, ask for thyself another kingdom,
For that which I leave is too small for thee. ==

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander

At the age of 19
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 BC
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men

King Darius III,
Defeated, fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King, as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river,
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis—the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the Gordian knot
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism, he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a Western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity

Marching on, marching on

The battle-weary, marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain, and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon"

The father, the mother, the sister, the chain
Sweet inspirations
Or a cold hearted nations baby
The young man, the brothers, the killers explain

Oh Jungleland
They call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope
And he's holding out his hand
He sees the Northern Lights
above this highrise land
Oh Jungleland
Oh Jungleland
Oh Jungleland

In the city, get out the city pretty quick
I've got a prayer, I wanna sing it to you
It says, may little children forget the wild things

But no one listens cause nobody cares
When you've got the love drugs
And you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven

Here comes summer, here comes violence
Over your shoulder the soul boy explains
Oh Jungleland
They call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope
And he's holding out his hand
He sees the Northern Lights
above the highrise land

But blood is thicker than water
But blood is sweeter than Holy Lands
Unto the Devil a daughter
When my love sings it's an angel song she sings it

Don't look back, never look back

Bind your hands with string
Caught in the sudden shower
Our host of heavenly kings
They're all victims of circumstance
Of ancient bells that bring
All the fear in the world, naked and shy
Down upon our heads, with no reason why

And though voices may holler
For all they're worth
The rabbits have fled their burrows
Gone to earth"

No me importa qué hiciste ayer

Hoy pienso en vos y estoy loco por tenerte
Pero después puede que ni quiera verte
Y eso me hace desearte más

Por qué insistís en seguir corriendo el tren
Si lo perdés aunque espere en el andén

No quiero que me escuches
Ni te quiero entender
No me cuentes tu historia
No la quiero saber

Por qué intentás abrumarme con detalles?
No ves que así el misterio se deshace?
Date tiempo para respirar!

Un caminante que respeta el camino
No deja huellas y se entrega a su destino
Un buen amante no habla demás

Por qué insistís en seguir corriendo el tren
Si lo perdés aunque espere en el andén

Por eso es que
No quiero que me escuches

No me cuentes tu historia

Just waiting for a foreign sound from the outside
Far beyond the atmospheres, she is listening for a call
To take her homewards to herself
Oh, I love you so
He who's master of the eyes of chance won't harm you in the morning
She knows that the pavement's hard
There between the stars
To travel on to Martian-Homesick-City

She is weeping silently, but there‚s not a tear
Just raindrops falling from the painted ceiling
The dance of the foraging bee will number all the things
She has been longing for since she was young
""I will not pass this night in vain"", she says
""I'll stand this kind of rain
I'll break the glass, I'll find the path""
Yes, Carol wants to go to Mars
Back where the red, cold sun
Is sinking to the Channels of A'DAAR

Day breaks through the grating
Someone moves a chair
And sunlight blisters dazzling on a glass
Take a pill and greet the day
For sedative holidays
Why aren't you sleeping at night?
Oh, I love you so
He who's master of the eyes of chance won't harm you 'til the evening
We shall meet tomorrow night
And I'll kiss you just as tenderly
As CYGNUS kissed the deserts

Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget her
How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning 
Just woke up the wanting in me"

How much I love you

The hands of love pushed me away
But soon you will reject that scene
For acts of love and passion plays

A perfect world without the lies

With your wristful of chains
And your fistful of change

Goes with my basement clothes

Quand l'amour meurt, ça devient chacun pour soi,

Quel est leur tort, quel est leur crime,
Pourquoi seraient-ils victimes
De notre échec à nous deux, pourquoi eux?
Qu'ont-ils fait pour souffrir de nos problèmes,
Eux qui sont ce que quand même nous avons fait de mieux?!
Toi contre moi, quelle raison donner
Au pourquoi des enfants étonnés?
Toi tu voudrais me les ôter, je devrais les emprunter,
Les prendre et les rapporter!
Toi contre moi, à ce jeu sans issue,
Il ne sort ni vainqueur ni vaincu.
Au bout du compte, il n'y a que les enfants
Qui pour finir sont perdants!
Non aux sorties à la sauvette, aux dimanches et jours de fêtes
Que peut accorder la loi chaque mois!
Tes amis auront beau dire et beau faire:
Je remuerai ciel et terre,
Tu ne les auras pas!
Toi contre moi, c'est l'enfer, c'est l'horreur,
Et pourtant hier, c'était le bonheur!
Toi contre moi, c'était la vie, ses merveilles et ses folies,
Dans tes bras et dans ton lit!
Toi contre moi, ce passé qui nous lie,
Il faudrait le garder à tout prix.
Se retrouver face à face au Tribunal
Ne nous ferait que du mal!
Viens! Faisons amende honorable, évitons l'irréparable
Et le point de non retour, pour qu'un jour
Affleurant de ce drame pitoyable

Another display of lust tonight
I cant control my feelings. They're out of hand
For that my emotions are on the losing end
But when I lay them on the line
It starts in front it ends behind
But it comes rinding to a halt. The time of my life
I'm sorry about this morning
I was thinking about last night.
Tonight I'll take on the world and then some
But I know it's just a romour of adrenaline

I disturbed sweet nothings with a mouth full of beer"

Chorus:
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her days on the train.
She's a semi good-looker, but the fast rails they took 'er,
Now she's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.

South Station in Boston to the freight yards of Austin,
From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain.
Now that the rail packs have taken the best tracks,
She's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.

Chorus

Once a highballin' loner, he thought he could own 'er,
Bought her a fur coat and a big diamond ring.
She hocked them for cold cash, left town on the Wabash,
Never thinkin', never thinkin' of home 'way back then.

But the rails are now rusty, the dining cars dusty,
The gold plated watches have taken their toll.
The railroads are dying, and the lady, she's crying,
On a bus to Kentucky, and home that's her goal.

Chorus 2:
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her life on the trains.
Once a Pullman car traveler, now the brakeman won't have her,
She's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.

Yeah, on a bus to Kentucky, then home - once - again."

Broken dreams.

Always walking up and down -
But I left my soul behind me 
In an old cathedral town""

I saw my own self seated in his chair
With gaze abstracted, furrowed forehead
Unkempt hair

I thought that I had suddenly come to die
That to a cold corpse this was my farewell
Until the pen moved slowly upon paper
And tears fell

He had written a name, yours, in printed letters
One word on which bemusedly to pore
No protest, no desire, your naked name
Nothing more

Would it be tomorrow, would it be next year
But the vision was not false, this much I knew
And I turned angrily from the open window
Aghast at you

Why never a warning, either by speech or look
That the love you cruelly gave me could not last
Already it was too late: the bait swallowed
The hook fast"

And marriage is when we admit our parents were right

What makes our love a sin
How can it make that difference
If you and I are wearing that bloody, bloody ring

If I share my bed with you
Must I also share my life
Love is just a moment of giving
And marriage is when we admit our parents were right

You just don't understnd it
This tender trap we're in
Those glossy catalogues of couples
Are cashing in on happiness again and again

And I'll make my sacrifice

Soldiers of fortune surrender like children
And follow wherever she leads
And they all fall down

But something else is calling her into the night
Can't you hear me? (dominoes, dominoes)
I'm coming back to find you
Don't let the shadows blind you from love when it's mine

To eyes that stared she never shared emotion
It's a secret that she keeps
And no one sees the tears that I see falling
Urgent whispers calling me

Conquering heroes have soon fallen prey
To that far away look in her eyes
And they all fall down

And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this 

Aerosmith:
She starts swingin with the boys in the school
With her feet flyin up in the air
Singing hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
I was swingin' like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a miss who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to 

Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith:
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
Well just gimme a kiss
Oooh, a-like this!"

Old idea from the woodstock generation
Calling all the kids from across the nation
In some it brings out love in others termination
Love and unity
Don't worry bout the power we got a generator
And publicity
Batteries for rent you can pay us later

Get your digital watches in synchronization
Producer of the shows got a selfish motivation
It's the place to be and we got a location
Another gold disc for an album compilation
Bring the family
Everybodys' welcome there will be no discrimination
Take a tip from me
In case there's a problem bring identification

C'mon every beatbox in the place to be
C'mon every beatbox we got a ramellzee
C'mon every beatbox let's party and how
C'mon every beatbox let's party right now
Party right now!

Watch me

So the holy smokes are coming we got a confirmation
Centre of the city been a major transformation
Gandhi got a shock and he took a vacation
Check the wild life it's a real fascination
Hope they stay in line
Raiders Possý British born but still they're Jamaican
Dailing 999
Salt 'n pepper people stirred not shaken

Heard about the party and they sent a delegation
The bulldog crew don't need no provocation
Got a strange idea about the country's liberation

Suck enchanted nightshade twine
Hear the bells beneath us chime
Sinking sermon, priest head murmurs
Holy words across the meadows
Kissed the plagues' black rolling hand
Through his lips the virus sang
And the rooks, they seemed to follow him
Wherever he goes
Flapping in the flat sky
Shrieking in the spire
Hanging from the lead sky
Dangling from the sun
The rooks, they seemed to follow him
Wherever he goes
Nodding thistle, english sun dew
Swansneck woman, child-bed meadow
Aching shoulders sink and grow
As the bells from ditches toll
And the smeared skin wrapped limbs
Of the night brothers
Struggling.... crawling
Through the empty crack of morning
Of the night brothers...
Of the night brothers....

See the zoo

I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me

Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

As you turn around and say

Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside

So far away - so little time the light is on the way
So far away - and still no trace of you
The night will soon be day

Something wicked passing this way comes
I can feel her laughter chill through my bones
How can I wait much longer I feel you here
Revenge is sweetly bitter cold with fear

You disappeared just when I knew you will
And all that's left is I've obsessed this hell

Becomes part of the machine.

Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.

Such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?

What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see no lights a flashin',
Plays by sense of smell,
Always has a replay,
An' never tilts at all...

Perhaps the girl has kissed the boy
And never will

Unkiss that kiss, she never could 
Untouch that touch, she never would 
Unkiss that kiss, she never could
Untouch that touch

She said she'd only meet him once
But then her dreams could not allow
Her to forget how much she had forgot
And he became her forget-me-not

Could warm her

Power in the hands of a worker
But it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand
There is power in a Union

Now the lessons of the past were all learned with workers' blood
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for
From the cities and the farmlands to trenches full of mud
War has always been the bosses' way, sir

The Union forever defending our rights
Down with the blackleg, all workers unite
With our brothers and our sisters from many far off lands
There is power in a Union

Now I long for the morning that they realise
Brutality and unjust laws can not defeat us
But who'll defend the workers who cannot organise
When the bosses send their lackies out to cheat us?

Money speaks for money, the Devil for his own
Who comes to speak for the skin and the bone
What a comfort to the widow, a light to the child
There is power in a Union

The Union forever defending our rights
Down with the blackleg, all workers unite
With our brothers and our sisters together we will stand
There is power in a Union."

Always seems to slip my mind
Does it really die with honour
Does it really matter

Sitting on a beach in Bali
Tried to reach and grab a cloud
Looked so much like cotton candy
And I'm feeling godlike
Could it be just what I'm eating
Only mushrooms after all
And with juice of avocado
I should live forever

It's a big world
It's a big world, so much to do

Sitting on the floor in Kyoto
Marvel at the latest catch
Eat it as soon as you are able
Quick before they cook it
There's an eyeball staring at me
And I know I've met my match
Do I eat or am I eaten
It's a new adventure

It's a big world, so much to do

From the Leningradsky Prospekt
On the road to Mandalay
There's a new intoxication
Hits you just as you're leaving

Smoke a pipe in Casablanca

Leopard yawns with breath like flowers
Amour - the love that kisses and recoils
Nothing - could steal this dream of bliss
And now we rest upon the sand
Waiting for the blessed dark and something Exquisite as this...

Yes... it was a desperate indulgence
All the more poignant for its emptiness
But you know... beauty can be terrifying
And there is nothing straightforward about pleasure

Wicked moon - framing us against the light

Thought that it was something
That I could live without
And now I am a victim
Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret
But the word got out
And I try hard to take it easy
But I've got to find some face to please me

(Chorus)

And now I am a victim
Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret
But the word got out
and I would feel much better about it
If I thought I stood some chance without it"

no tiene que darle cuerda es automático.
Puedes oír sus pataditas, está vivo creo yo
Marta tiene un pasajero en su corazón, en su corazón.

Siento un golpe en el pecho
yo solo quería besarle
ha salido el marcapasos
entre vísceras y sangre.
Mirale que ojitos tiene
es idéntico a su padre, 
es idéntico a su padre.

Juega con todos los niños
les arranca el corazón
se los come con tomates, qué simpático

No hay criatura más hermosa
que el pequeño marcapasos
Marta estalla como loca de manicomio
de manicomio.

Siento un golpe en el pecho
yo solo quería besarle
ha salido el marcapasos
entre vísceras y sangre.
Mirale que ojitos tiene
es idéntico a su padre,

There's somethin' I just have to say
I don't think I could hide what I'm feelin' inside another day
Knowin' I love you

And I, I'm gettin' too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I tell you tonight would you turn out the lights and walk away
Knowin' I love you?

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man and make you understand, Amanda
I love you

And, I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me to feel this way
I don't wanna lose you

So it may be too soon, I know
The feelin' takes so long to grow
If I tell you today, will you turn me away and let me go?
I don't wanna lose you

I'm gonna take you by surprise and make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away, I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man and make you understand, Amanda (Oh, girl!)

You and I, I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie, girl
Tomorrow may be too late

You, you and I, girl, we can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late, ohohoho

And feelin' the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you"

Flotte entre chienne et loup

Chippin’ away, little by little, day by day.
Chippin’ away, and the walls will come tumbling down.
Oh what a wonderful sound.

There is a wall around the church,
And a wall around the prison.
I think the wall around your heart, baby
Is blocking out your vision.

So put a hammer in your hand,

On Corporation Street 
Changing, always changing 
But only to repeat

The need to transcend
Defeat the need to pretend

Love is always cause for celebration 
The other three dimensions let you down 
There's no need to leave the love station 
You can take this trip in any town 
Once you know the destination 
There's no need to leave the love station
If you can make it there

For mercy, pity, peace and love 
Are all you need 
Money, though we don't have much
Will only buy you greed

It's cheap to defeat
The vicious need to compete

You thought the doors of love 
Had slammed on you 
You pull the brocade curtains tightly to 
Turn up the sprouts
Let your mascara run
Forget yourself
And get some loving done"

Await the death by the blade
Run before it's too late
Await the axe in your back
As the ripping corpse attack!

You begin to sweat, you begin to cry
As you watch this scene
At first you see your children die
You wish it was a dream
He eats the heart of your wife
And rips her cunt inside
You know now it's your turn
The others have already died

Await the death by the blade
Run before it's too late
Await the axe in your back
As the ripping corpse attack!

Now he's close to you
His eyes are cold and cruel
Fear is in your heart
His might will rip you apart

Eternal horror, eternal horror
Eternal wickedness, eternal death
Life taking bloodrain neverending death-pain
No one will care when you die!

Sex on his mind
Seems to me he wants sex all the time
I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind
And when he wants it he gets sex all the time

He's got a taste for everything
He gives the kind of state the morning brings
He's got his never ending love for me
He gives what your dreams cause in the night
He's got the kind of love that makes you blind
He gives attention to your tender spots
He's got...Hot!

I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind
And when he wants it he gets sex all the time

HOT! (sex...)

He shoes all the parts that gets you hooked
He looks up at you when he is down
He cooks up a storm and shakes it round
He takes all you got and that's for sure
He gets, mmm, just what he's begging for
He's got... but most of all he's got

Seems to me he wants sex all the time
I can't believe the way his heart rules his mind
But when he wants it he gets sex all the time

They froze my blood and changed my soul
The master has spoken, the truth, not any lies
The Devil gives and evil takes
The thing in life that man forsakes
A throne in hell, a price or a sacrifice ?
Still the wind was blowing soft
And gentle here under the oak
Which gave me shelter and rest infor my trial
I'm not strong, weak is my mind
A new beginning, where to find ?
I'm the last one on earth, please forgive us our crime
It was a time, when love was mine
Now it's time to sacrifice

My heart, bleeding for my race
The traces of mankind sweeped out
By the hand of our Lord
I cried for the ones I lost
Midnight in paradise, grief
Away goes my hope
I cried for the ones I lost

Hear my prayers
Climbing on the clouds above
Silent cry
Reach the inner halls of truth
Give me a sign !

A crimson sky, bless my eyes
Up goes the sun, my time has come"

Don't forget I loved you once
And now it's turned full circle

That none of the living are saved

Ride through the burning skies
See that no one survives
Send their souls to hell

Death force captive of the cloud that lurks above
Searing heat the fires coalesce into a storm
No retreat Satan holds the power of the gods

Satan stands watching alone in his ground
He laughs with a deafening cry
Evil and hatred vengeance and death
The fires are burning the sky
Earth is now wasteland infernal hell
Nothing but darkness remains

Return it to hell's dark domain

Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care

I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care

No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love

And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"
137,Juan Carlos Baglietto,Dormite Patria,TRWCINU128F425C33C,1986,"Dormite patria sobre mi camisa
olvidate pronto de los que te pisan
dormite patria que la noche es fria
y hay un viento blanco sobre la avenida.

Quiero llevarte como cuando era otro
y te lucia flamante sobre el guardapolvo
todavia no habia crecido
y estabas prendida a mi solapa blanca
como un papelito
Dormite patria que los corazones
te haran de almohada para los pulmones.

Dormite patria que suena la radio
y alguen que te nombre lo dice cantando
quiero llevarte porque siempre es invierno
y no tenes un techo y estan los lobos sueltos
Malena, Carlitos Gardel y los caudillos
las madres de los pañuelos
y los hijos de mis hijos.

El que vende flores 
yo que canto esas canciones
esas chicas de las tiendas 
los que arreglan los motores
te vamos a hace una ronda
que abarque todo el mapa
y entre provincia y provincia
no habra limites ni nada.

Dormite patria como mi enamorada
llevo tu corpiño atado en mi lanza
el ultimo aliento la cancion que me queda
es que seas distinta a la que vi 
en la escuela
Quiero llevarte como cuando era otro
y te lucia flamante sobre el guardapolvo
todavia no habia crecido
y estabas prendida a mi solapa blanca
como un papelito.

Dormite patria 
que en la cuadra aqui cerca
suena ya la murga para que te duerma
Dormite patria pero dormi conmigo
para que la muerte se lleve al domingo."

Knows the language well, the moves and the speech
Behind a blinding smile hides her empty eyes

won't you please love my friends
Won't you please suck my friends
Won't you please

Party down with everyone

Love you for the weekend

won't you please love my friends

She's so modern
She's so stylish
Mohawk on one side, long hair on the other
She's got all her bases covered

She always wants someone else
She's an 80's girl, looking out for herself
so where do you draw the line
Between a whore and a concubine?

80's girl needs a friend
Getting the goods and having such a good time
80's girl needs a friend

1, 2, 3, 4

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will, it's just a question of when

I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire, the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust, oh

Now I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're going to face a moment of truth

It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
It's a matter of trust

You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for God's sake don't shut me out

This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk a way a fool or a king

Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust

I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong

Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust

It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust
'Cause it's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust"
141,Ella Fitzgerald,Let Yourself Go,TRBSKJC12903CF3C64,1986,"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble?
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow?
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So:

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba?
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""No, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go"

I'm hopin' that it might be you, but it wasn't anyone at all
I can still remember the way things were
If I could only bring you back, then I wouldn't need to say a word
When we made love, it felt so strong, I remember
We were so much in love, where did our love go wrong
Remembering the things we used to say
The memories are drifting by, but the pain is here to stay
And it's no illusion, I'm a lock without a key
I'm only livin' half a life, without you here with me
When we made love, a love that felt so strong, I still remember
We were so deep in love, where did our love go wrong

I can feel every touch again, as real as it is crazy
And I kiss every kiss again, so tender they amaze me
I live through the end again, feeling like I'm dying
And then I touch my cheek, realize I'm crying
When we made love, a love so strong, and I remember
We were so deep in love, so tell me, where did our love go wrong
When we made love, we belong together
It's those nights I'm dreaming of, they'll stay with me, they'll last forever

Close by your side
Living in my dreams

Right by your side
Living in my dreams

I'm asking the questions
That play on my mind
I'm killing time
Memories to find
Thinking 'bout the friends
I've left behind

I'd make the wrong move
Again and again
I sing the same blues
Again and again

I keep searching

No point in lying

No place to run
No place to hide
No place to roam

The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life

Forced in like cattle, you run
Stripped of your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil

Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last in this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare

Wings of pain reach out for you
His face of death staring down, your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of the mutant he's creating

Pathetic harmless victims left to die
Rancid Angel of Death flying free

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of Death

147,Beastie Boys,Paul Revere,TRYPSZP12903CBCC19,1986,"Now here's a little story I gots to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA and me, Mike D.

I  had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Ridin' cross the land, kickin' up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat

Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name is MCA, I said ""howdy"", he said ""hi.""

He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip

He said ""Can I get some?""
I said ""You can't get none.""
I had a chance to run,
but he pulled out his shotgun.
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead.
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said

""Now, my name is MCA, I got a license to kill.
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill.
So what do we have here? An outlaw and his beer.
I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear.""

We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
As if this story's over, but it's ready to begin

""I've got the gun, you've got the brew.
You've got two choices of what you can do.
It's not a tough descision as you can see.
I can blow you away or you can ride with me.""

I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border.
The Sheriff is after me for what I did to his daughter.
I did it like this, I did it like that.
I did it with the whiffle ball bat.

So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun.
And right about now it's time to have some fun.
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name,
and I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""

We rode for six hours then we hit the spot
The beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hot
This dude was starin' like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar

MCA said ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said I didn't but I knew he did
The kid said, ""Get ready, cuz this ain't funny.
My name is Mike D and I'm about to get money.""

He pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky.
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" And let two fly.
Hands went up and people hit the floor.
He wasted two kids that ran for the door.

""I'm Mike D and I get respect.
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect.""
MCA what with it, and he's my ace,
So I grabbed the piano player and punched him in the face

The piano player's out, the music stopped
This boy had beef, and he got dropped.
Mike D grabbed the money, MCA snatched the gold.
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold."

Looking for love

""Look Jenny"" I said ""It's Dwight he just came in""
I got excited but Jenny was quick
The kettle was on and it started up steamin'
And I knew from her flirtin' she was up to her tricks

A song on the jukebox made me feel lonely
The kettle boiled down and evaporated me
But who was to notice 'cause Jenny was glowin'
And Dwight was all over her like a honey bee

Two hot girls on a hot summer night
Looking for love

Maybe I shouldn't have worn such a long dress
Maybe he thinks I'm too young or too old
If only I hadn't been born with these sad eyes
Perhaps I'm too shy or too bold

Me and Jenny, twinklin' like crystal and pennies

And I waved goodnight

Let the secrets of love start to smile

We could find forever if we let love rise again

Tell me why can't we reach for another chance at heaven

It was all arranged you couldn't live there anymore
All you had was that old place in the middle of the path of progress
So they took the space and put the ceiling on the floor
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
It was hidden so well that no one knew
Just the place for taking in the view

The View of the sea crisp and clear and neverending
There your soul ran free there you spirit soared
The View took you away to the boundaries of imagination
Back to yesterday back to once before
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
A mysterious space without a clue
Just the place for taking in the View

Long lives need no fortune
Hard lives need no fame
Young lives seek their freedom
And old lives seek the same

The world began to change and without a word of explanation
Something very strange started beckoning to you
When they came to mvoe your things you had packed a suitcase full of memories
Nothing else to bring except a different point of View
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
A mysterious space without a clue
Just the place for taking in the View"

That his gods are the only truth
Fanatic faith, fanatic deeds
Join my religion or die

Jews killed jesus, christians slaughtered jews
Millions die for their faith
Each religion prays that killing is a sin
How stupid logic can be

Curse the gods
Too many people have died
Curse the gods
That fools have died for a lie

Beware of those fools that keep telling you
God loves you, for you his son died

Another night beckons to you
Your parties fall around you
Another night beckons to you

Shadows look as you resist the gloom
Faded hues issue forth and bloom

A bed of leaves for a lover
Awake with a kiss and rise asunder
And when the party's over
You retreat in a realm of slumber

In your mind, crystal lights rebound
Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

Through rose-tinted glass you still remember
The gladness, not sadness, only laughter

In your mind vicious lights rebound
Wheels spin round and you hear the sound
Of autumn's call at party's fall, autumn's call

The smile in the mirror grows weaker
The laughter you heard is growing fainter

Your parties fall around you
The night forgets to rouse you
Your party's fall astounds you
An aura of sadness abounds you

Glad rags sigh, maybe you're alone
Maybe you're alone inside, don't hide
Hurting all the time, hurting deep inside
Don't cry, don't cry

My happiness depends on knowing
This friend is never alone
On your own, a party on our own
We'll have a party on our own, inside
No sighs, don't cry, don't cry"

Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more, Angie baby

CHORUS :

Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe - well maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbour boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night, through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today?
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Till his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Towards the radio he's bound, never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No-one asks you to explain

Went driving in the summer
Promises in every star

I could hear some people laughing
I felt my heart beat back
A weekend's worth of sadness

There was a farmhouse
That had long since been deserted
We stopped and carved our hearts
Into the wooden surface

We thought just for an instant
We could see the future
We thought for once we knew
What really was important

Coming up close
Everything sounds like welcome home
Come home, and oh, by the way

Don't you know that I could make
A dream that's barely half-awake come true

I wanted to say
But anything I could have said
I felt somehow that you already knew

We got back in the car
And listened to a Dylan tape
We drove around the fields
Until it started getting late

And I went back to 
My hotel room on the highway
And he just got back
In his car and drove away

City to city, I'm running my rhymes

On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm willing and able

Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kickin' it live

Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

He's got his own room at the back of the bus

Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while

Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back

I can hear you breathing down the hall
Soul in isolation
I can hear you whisper through the walls
And if i had a mind to now
I could call to you
Or i could simply shut you out
No more would you cry, cry, cry

I give you my time to kill
But you'll never never break my will
Or I could sink a sleeping pill
And in the morning could be sleeping still
But most of you are much too ill
Oh, way beyond a surgeon's skill
In bondage to a dollar bill
What more can you buy, buy, buy

Oh, when you think on it, when you think of it
We're all souls in isolation
Alive in here, I'm alive in here
I'm alive in here
Oh, when you think on it, when you think of it
Come here
A word in your ear (x 3)
Go back to the trees (x 3)

Big bad giant standing tall
Crushing all the creatures great and small
I'd like to see this giant fall
When will it come? (x 2)
Words that rattle round my head
Struck by lightning,someone said
Diamond bullet, through the head
Right in the brain
Are they right in the brain?

Will i see the jailer's face?
Did my mother lead me to this place?
Will i live to see his face?
Or will another come to take my place?
In total isolation
Surrounded by fears
Too many clowns, too many tears
Isolation
Surrounded by crowds
In another world, head in the clouds!
I'm alive in here, i scream
But you still can't hear
I'm alive in here
I'm alive, turn on the light

Oh, when you think on it, when you think on it
We're all souls in isolation
Alive in here, I'm alive in here
I'm alive in here
Oh, when you think on it
Souls in isolation

We're always searching for something
Searching
Dear, dear, dead days
I'm longing for you

Thinking of poisoning me

The reptile slithers to me
Just one more persuasion
Her cold blood boils from the heat

Penetration, injection is painless
Forked-tongue flicking about
A constrictor in the form of a woman
With such a grip, I barely got out

Just mix in the Tuna Helper and ta-da!

The whole family things my new meals are delicious
They ask me ""what's your secret?"" Abby, I think they're getting suspicious

So give your permission
For others to fool around
With my ignition

But I'm full of heart
And I've got an empty head

Standing by my side

If I could save all of my kisses just for you

I dreamed I had to take a test
In a Dairy Queen on another planet.
And then I looked around

And there was this woman.
And she was making it all up.
She was writing it all down.
And she was laughing.
She was laughing her head off.

Where the haircuts smile
And the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss
Where you win or you lose
And it's them who choose
And if you don't win then you've lost

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)
Don't believe it, oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)

It's another night out with the boss
Following in footsteps overgrown with moss
And he tells me that women grow on trees
And if you catch them right they will land upon their knees

Where they open all their wallets
And they close all their minds
And they love to buy you all a drink
And as we ask all the questions
And you take all your clothes off
And back to the kitchen sink 

What a good place to be
Don't believe it
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me (it's happy hour again)

I'm terrified to look beyond the threat
I kill ambition while I can

I'm cold
I drag the beauty, black confetti swept away
Stumbling, we go blindly marching on
Bursting like a dream and now all gone
In time I know we'll fly again

Frail as ever, still the most severe
Haven't I surrendered everything now?
Naked in my cruellest waking fear
From the rages of the weightless sleep

""Who will catch him falling?"" called the wind
""I will claim him,"" volunteered the grave
""Marry me forever,"" cried the bride
Said the orphan, ""Who'll remember me?
Anyone at all?
Are you coming back?""

From the moment we were torn
Thrown into the tunnel, we withdrew
Whiter colours then untied
Don't desert me now, I'm coming through

I fought the memory of beautiful things
Imaginings
The only strength I got from wanting you
All the love I've been needing
The hunger is feeding on me
Spirit, bear me away
To the place of birth

You, you put the fear in
The fear of flying
The breath of dying

You want a sign

How he tries to hide
Confused with how he's feeling
Ends up wanting much more
Waits for the bell to ring
But no-one's at the door.
Living in a jail house
A cell of his own
Will he ever have his freedom
Inside of his home?
And the warden is his father
The watcher his mum
Under lock and key
Until he's 21

Uncertain where he's going
Uncertain of his love
Uncertain what is coming
Is this the punishment for love?

They gave him everything he wanted
And a little bit more
But nothing seems to please him
He stares at the floor
Watching from the window
His friends passing by
Wishing he could be there (never satisfied)
Living in a jailhouse
A cell of his own
Will he ever have his freedom
Inside of his home
The judge it is his father
The jury his mum
He'll just have to serve his sentence
Until he's 21

Well you know
Time waits for no-one
Got a pace of its own
The dawning of an idea
To go it alone
Longing for adventure
Fear of the unknown
Trying to find the courage
Make a break of his own
Fleeing from that jailhouse
His heart full of hope
There's a ride waiting for him
To take him to the smoke"

apart-outside who can escape 
our destiny confirmed in fate. 

Always and forever near or far. 
Safe in your bosom here we are. 
Pain does not mean feel no joy. 
Re-ignition for girl and for boy. 

Re-ignition 
Re-ignition
Re-ignition

that this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape 
Millenium confirmed in fate."
245,Don Johnson,CAN'T TAKE YOUR MEMORY,TRDOFPX128F42659FC,1986,"You can pack your bags, take a walk
Throw your hands in the air, refuse to talk
Swear to be damned, it was all a bad dream
Leaving me with a silent scream

You can take the photos off the walls
Leave empty echoes in the halls
I still see your face when I look around
I see your lips move, but there's no sound

You can throw away reminders of you and me
But you can't take your memory
No, you can't take that part of you from me
Can't take your memory
It's so deep in the heart of me

I know some day I'll break free
From thinkin' 'bout those used-to-be's
Even though you're long since gone
It's those little things about you that keep hangin' on

You can throw away reminders of you and me
But you can't take your memory
No, you can't take that part of you from me
Can't take your memory
It's so deep in the heart of me

It's no good to dwell upon it they say
I've found a thousand ways to make it through each day
Then the sun goes down, and the shadows grow tall
My mind goes to you like it's nothing at all

'Cause you're still in my heart
You're still in my heart, baby
You're still in my heart

Can't take your memory
No, you can't take that part of you from me
You can take my heart, tear it apart
But you'll never, never take your memory
'Cause you're still in my heart"

I just want to be
The one that you want to see
I just want to have you near me

Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime
Too many empty nights
Could make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's alone at home

Awaiting the day
That you are coming to stay
I hate to see you go away
But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

And hold you close to me, all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else

But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind of someone, who would not understand
On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go, is on the other hand

Yeah the reason I must go, is on the other hand"

And I don't know how to tell you
But maybe this time I can't come back
Because I might be too far down

I wish for real
That I could turn it on and off
Like hot and cold and up and down
Because I'm down again

I'm too far down
I couldn't begin to smile
Because I can't even laugh or cry
Because I just can't do it

If it was so easy to be happy
Why am I so down?
All I can do is sit and wonder if it's going to end
Or if I should just go away forever

When I sit and think
I wish that I just could die
Or let someone else be happy
By setting my own self free

And you don't want the emotion
Because the taste it leaves is for real
But nothing's ever real until it's gone
And I might be too far down

And is this just another thrown away
Or is this the end of the whole stupid road
But you wouldn't want to know how I feel anyway
Because the darkest hole is at the end of the road

I'm down again
And I guess I'm not the only one who dreams
That there's not any way to tell you
Because I might be too far down"

Please help me I'm falling in love with you
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold

I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the will to be true

Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin

People talk, they love to whisper, 
think of all the boys who've kissed her.
But to me it doesn’t matter,
Fade away fade away.
Fade away.

When we met we fell together,
Now she's gone I can't forget her.
Love is chance but time won't let her
Fade away and fade away.
Fade away, fade away.

Like flowers in this world I’ve never seen.
I wanna hold your love,
I wanna win your love for me.

Fade away.

For me there was no sunshine,
For me there was no rain.
For me until I met you,
Every day was the same.

Fade away, fade away, fade away.
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away.

And I tell myself to...

Watch your step boy, you havn't got what it takes
Life seems so profound and if a man can't do it
Then it's up to you to be around, you got me

All in red and
you're all in red
Your all, all in red

Creating Life that satisfies
is surely all down to compromise
Ambition is dying now there must be something more
A feeling of relaxation reapers at my door
Or is it in my mind...

Watch your step boy, You havn't got what it takes

Every love is one more victim they never realize
All their desires burn like a fever
They want to run but they just can't leave her

Do they know how you scream
Secret Service passion - hunger
Do they know how you scream

I should have seen through her diguise She was a masquerade
Cold kiss hungry eyes then she began to fade
Feeling lost I want to be found

Kid runs in crying from playing in the garden

What's making our eyes so itchy?
Don't rub 'em, they'll swell up
Oh, it's a big waste dump
Oh yeah, oh yeah

We built your ticky-tacky houses on landfill soil
To cover up a gift we left you years before
Of toxic chemicals and leaking gas
Just dig a little while, you'll find our acid baths

Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away

Groundwater's poisoned, air stings like hell
The lines for doctors grow long
Over martinis the company laughs
We don't owe you a damn thing

But what about all these fainting spells?
How'd you like a lick from my open sores?
And oh, why are our babies stillborn?
Oh yeah, oh yeah

A storage tank's leaking, it's about to explode
Why evacuate when you can watch the fun?
Nothing happens here, get out the lawn chairs
We'll drink pink lemonade and watch Martinez burn

Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away
Leak by the day

The land we sold you is right atop our acid pits
We fill them by the truckload in the dead of night
There's a thousand more toxic tips of the iceberg
We pay a little bribe or we just don't report them

And see what you get?
Cesspools in Eden, in Eden
No accident
Just a little of our greed-fueled negligence

So you've found the proof why your cancer rate's shot up
What are you gonna do when we've got all the cards?
Times Beach, Rocky Flats, Love Canal and Bhopal
Merry Christmas, hostages, from the folks that care

Now it's about to be and your bus and the lovely miss liberty 
Is just another whore, there's somethin I gotta tell ya

You might as well hate yourself, you find that you dont deserve it now 
More than anyone else, so get out of your kitchen 
And get out of your bed, got to tell them what you've always wanted to tell them 
'Coz in the morning you might be dead so dont call the doctor 
'Coz I'll be ok, its just a passing sad daydream and it led me astray 
And its hard to see things your way, and its hard to understand the things you say 
But most of all, its hard to get hard these days, and I ain't proud of nothin 
But its better that way 'coz its too loud for talkin, and there aint much to say

Familiar faces on the train
Running scared, and staying sane

Well that's your own reward
So don't walk with me
Watching the wildlife
The beast within you
Eats your heart out
Get free from hate and get in love

Boys in the backyard
The girls are hanging out the lines
Washing their, washing a troubled square
It's game we have to play
Ghosts are chasing you round
Things that happen in the past
Don't make that mistake again
The sun beats down the streets of passion

If you live by the sword
Well that's your own reward
So don't talk with me
Watching the wildlife
The beast within you
Eats your heart out
Get free from hate and get in love

Your own worst enemy
Get free from hate and get in love

If you live by the sword
Watching the wildlife
Watching you
The beast within you too
Watching the wildlife

Get in love, get in love

Watching the wildlife
We all live in a dream in home
We watch TV and drive a car

Run about their world.

World party - How can I say no?
No Party - You know I've got to go
Go Party - to a world party tonight.

I'm going to ask a dolphin
See if you can find a tiger 
whose eyes are still alight
With your little head in his mouth 
Everything's gonna be alright.
I hear theres going to be a harvest
Where every creature gets a share
Of life and food and light.
Ba-ba-ba-bah
Unless we learn we're the dumbest creatures 
That ever walked the world

Are you going?
Yes we're going to a world party.
Well, how can I say no?
Yes we're going to a world party.
You know I've got to go.
Yes we're going to a world party.
You know, you know, you know, he
Pa-party
Pa-pa-party

This party's in the mountains
And in the fields and on the shore 
And at the bottom of the sea
In the desert, in the marshes
Underground up your tree
Ba-ba-ba-bah
And out in space you can hear the creatures
sing about their world

Are you going?
Yes we're going to a world party,
Well, how can I say no?
Yes we're going to a world party.
You know I've got to go.
Yes we're going to a world party.
Yes we're going to a world party.
Yes we're going to a world party.

Yes we're going to a world party."
267,Peter Hammill,Silver (2007 Digital Remaster),TRXDTNY128F4229608,1986,"You lay your plans, I take them as they come,
I understand: we dance to different drums.
It's not in any schoolbook,
you're here to teach a lesson to us all...
we play by different rule-books.
What you say, what you do,
they're such different things, which is true?
Now the telephone rings, Mephistopheles calling...
Forty pieces for each lie you've told
I hope your linings as they all unfold are silver.

Once we were friends in our idealist days,
still, let's pretend, it's funny in a way
that now our friendship's token
you like to say I owe you everything –
some debts remain unspoken.
Double talk, double standards,
you speak with two tongues, truth's abandoned,
all life has become one-way traffic to lucre.
You take your meetings on the cloth of gold,
just down the river from the lives you've sold for silver.

The silver crossed your palm,
oh, can you see the future?
I hope you'll know when you sold your soul.
Argente, argent.

All the things you've done will carry their own taint
and a day will come when you chorus the complaint
that your friends don't do you fairly;
the back you turned, the shoulders that you shrugged
now fit the blame quite squarely.
What you want, what you need,
your emotional greed all-consuming
but no hearts will bleed and the coffers are empty.
Yes, in the end you'd give it all away,
but on the sockets of your eyes they lay the silver."
268,Juan Carlos Baglietto,Tu Mismo Paso,TRXTBOX128F425C345,1986,"Se descubren, se miden

Se bienhieren, se hacen cargo
de sol y luna.
Se protegen, se aniquilan
se lamen las heridas
ellos están tan cerca
pasan siempre a tu lado,
pero no te das cuenta,
llevan tu mismo paso.
Ellos guardan guardapolvos,
tanto polvo que el viento"

To turn from him is what we've got in mind

Just a liar and a thief
The word tells us so
We like to let him know
Where he can go

To hell with the devil

You know who to blame
He will always live
Up to his name

270,Ella Fitzgerald,Remember,TRFQZOZ128F429A65E,1986,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
But soon the May-time turned to December
You had forgotten; do you remember?"

Somewhere warm where they can spend their days
Air is stagnant and he feels unclean
Hair hangs greasy and he smells obscene
Something's happened and it's not so good
broken bottles in the face of love
Mottled flesh under the harsh strip-light
Nylon sheets to keep them warm at night
Once it's started it can never stop
fills his head with a dark damp fog 
In the distance is a constant cry
growing louder as the years go by 
Days get longer and he starts to drink
spews his stomach in the kitchen sink
Tells his children they should have respect
Tells his wife that she's a nervous wreck

He hates his wife and he hates them all 
He hates his wife and he hates them all 

Can't be bothered when it's all the same
leave it long enough, it goes away
In the meantime stomach turns to fat
She tries to tell him but he can't have that
She's only jealous and she's telling lies
Standing naked in his flesh disguise
It took him months to get her into bed 
now he's got her he just wants her dead 
She wants excitement and she needs romance
all she gets are dirty underpants
Stupid animal that can't know why
something's wrong so someone has to die
The wind is blowing and the rain falls down
Sends his family on a trip down town
Sees them die in a burning wreck
Sees them burn, smokes a cigarette

He hates his wife and he hates them all
He hates his wife and he hates them all

He knows he's finished but he can't stop now
and he wants to end it but he can't see how 
and it's all in pieces, thrown it all away
Oh, but he's not ugly, he just looks that way
And he wants some quiet and he needs it now
but the scream he's started's getting far too loud
and he still pretends he does it just for now
His day will come he'll lose it all somehow
Killing time until his ship arrives
been dead ten years but he's still alive
and the time is wasted and the ship has sunk 
but he hasn't noticed and he comes home drunk
and he's just dead weight, he'll never leave the ground
He tries to stand but he keeps falling down
and it's hard to know he doesn't count for much 
He's not a has-been, just a never-was
Oh he hates his wife and he hates them all

He hates his wife and he hates them all 
Hates his wife
Hates them all."

But it's just the same wherever you go
You just wish the ghost was gone
So you make some calls
But it's talking while you're wanting to go
You're just ringing phones for fun
You can always make a new excuse to cry
But you don't have to use it on yourself

So why spend your sadness now
Save it up for me on Sunday
And why is lonely all you have
When love is what you'll find on Sunday

You might guard your heart
But it's awfully fun to have it broken
Or at least to leave a bruise
It becomes an art
Though the rules of which are rarely spoken
By the lucky ones who can choose
So your pain becomes another souvenir
And your souvenirs become your world

So why spend your sadness now
Save it up for me on Sunday
And why is lonely all you have
When love is what you'll find on Sunday

Why spend your sadness now

Don't go giving me reasons, we all have a price
And in that moment of indecision, you'll never understand why

It shouldn't take too long, to set the thing moving
It shouldn't take too long, so long as you believe it
It shouldn't take too long, (to get what you want)

Forget the popular notion, lead the way
You've never known what you wanted until today
Through fire and water, you, you can survive

Every hour seemed days to me

Pretending to mourn these brave young men who came home from Beirut

We knew they were sitting ducks, we sacrificed 'em, Aztec style
So we could use their dead meat to cook up war fever back home

So make sure you take lots of pictures and slant your news our way

Oh won't somebody cut me down and set me free?
I've spent so long killing time and now it's killing me

Think I'm going up again
Hear the angels fall
Think I'm going up again
Catch me when I fall

Swallow down inside of me

Think I'm going up again
Hear the angels fall
Think I'm going up again
Catch me when I fall

I've got a happy head
Just like the angel said
I've got a happy head
Just like the angel said
Happy head!"

I gotta let some joy in
I hear that freedom will win
Oh where oh where can Jah love be now
My dear, it's here in the underground
Inside the hearts of your own children
In this house of suffering
I spiritualogic grin, in
One way grace is my friend
To conquer doom and sin
And all the nations lying
While all our people crying
And they stop at nothing!...nothing!...nothing!
In this house of suffering
Don't want but just one thing
Got to have my origin
In this house of suffering."

What can I write
What can I say

Of jealous desert sands
As ancient evening
Spreads across the land

CHORUS:
Living loving
Ancient evening
Seeing
Believe in your love

So after I die
And I leave here
Will time, wind and
Thieves ravage me
Place my body
Beneath the desert sand
And pray that the queen
Welcomes me

Colour the black
In my soul white
From out of the dark
Comes the daylight
Untold treasures are
Hidden memories
Of ancient evening
That you have given me

That good ol' cowboy music is all I'm supposed to like
But here lately I don't know what's happening but I'm losin' control
I'm losin' control
To a little longhaired outlaw who's a ridin' somewhere deep down in my soul
He likes rock and roll

Well he rides a pinto stallion down the canyons of my mind
Makes camp beneath a memory below the timberline
Got a little electric fender guitar plugs direct into my soul
Right into my soul
Turns up the volume bends them guitar strings and plays that rock and roll
Ah and here he goes

Well I can be do a concert strummin' along just fine
Playing Little Joe The Wrangler when somethin' snaps inside my mind
And I can feel that longhaired music wellin' up from the rivers of my soul
Where the music flows
When that little longhair outlaw takes over and makes me play that rock and roll oh yeah

Now if you like cowboy music and you don't like this song
Well I'd like to apologize if the tune kinda came out wrong
But you see I can't help myself the little longhair has got control
And he won't let go
But I'll get back to my cowboy music but sometimes you gotta play a little rock and roll
It's my turn it's about time"

I hear the music of your speech
Distant echoes through the wall
But words seem far beyond my reach
Do you hear my silent call?

Just like a memory
You stand between the real world and my fantasy
Just like a memory
I know you've got the power to set me free

I see the sadness in your eyes
Wish that you could understand
I can't let go of what's inside
Can you still take me as I am?

Just like a memory
You stand between the real world and my fantasy
Just like memory
I know you've got the power to set me free

No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""Rage""

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again"

And now my sanity's gettin' harder to hold
I'm kinda tired
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand

Now don't take advice from a stranger
You can't live your life by what others do
We're all here alive for a reason
You'll never know

You'll never know just what it means
You'll never know just what it was

How can I make it alone?
It's such a crazy world,
And I'm feelin' so stoned
I'm kinda tired
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand
Just sleepin' in the sand

You can't see the light from an angel
You can't add the price of what others do

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.
 
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue.
 
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.

Started a diamond hill
You were my biggest thrill

I know you tried to hurt me
Seen it in your face
You took my world, my world, my world its not a pretty place
It would be so good if I could keep all up my head
Cause it took so long to forget about the things you said

Started a diamond hill
You were my biggest thrill

Don't want to touch you
Don't want to hold you now baby...
Want to forget you

Reaching out, lashing out

Run down the walls
I can't believe they never fall
The walls never leave
And the walls begin to scream 

I
And my toes against the wall
I stare ahead
The door inside the wall
Your face inside the door
You crawl across the room 

The picture never moves
My books are very still
You slide to my feet
You slide across the floor 

I
Throw your head across the ice
I
Throw my head through the window
Crash
Like poetry 

It's four o'clock, I'm waiting
Your face appears
I keep forgetting your name
While I'm writing this, you
You crash through the wall

You fall off the floor 

I
Slide your head across the ice
I
Throw my hands through the window
Crash
Like gods

A room
Full of delicate cutters
All sitting down, the room has many doors
All but one of them are closed
She goes around
(Remember)
Opening the doors 

This has another ending
Full of innocent children
One of them are closed 

She goes around
This has another ending
Remember the room

Opening the doors"

I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill
But it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in

Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them
I can hear them 
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

Taught by the powers
That preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen
I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
All right

But just like the wounded
And when it's too late
They'll remember
They'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do

I knew it wasn't love, it didn't have to be
She was there, and I was there
That's all

Lonely is the night and when we broke a heart
You know it's beating every day
And when I think of her, I have to smile
She helped to ease the pain

I knew it wasn't love, it didn't have to be
She was there, and I was there
That's all

And she took me far, far into the night
She didn't let go 'til the morning light
We didn't say a word, I didn't know her name
But that didn't cause her to leave

What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?
What about you, how can I count on you to count on me?

I like to drive my car
If I've got someplace to go
I like to feel the wheel
Put down the top and let it roll.

Don't try to fence me in,
Don't try to slow me down
Don't try to speed me up,
Or tie my feet down to the ground.

What about you, did I ever take a thing from you?
What about me, how do I know that your love is true?

302,Billy Bragg,The Home Front,TRNWDFA128F428B203,1986,"Father mowsthe lawn and Mother peels the potatoes
Grandma lays the table alone
And adjusts a photograph of the unknown soldier
In this Holy of Holies, the Home
And from the TV an unwatched voice
Suggests the answer is to plant more trees
The scrawl on the wall says what about the workers
And the voice of the people says more salt please

Mother shakesher head and reads aloud from the newspaper
As Father puts another lock on the door
And reflects upon the violent times that we are living in
While chatting with the wife beater next door
If paradise to you is cheap beer and overtime
Home truths are easily missed
Something that every football fan knows
It only takes five fingers to form a fist

And whenit rains here It rains so hard
But never hard enough to wash away the sorrow
I'll trade my love today for a greater love tomorrow
The lonely child looks out and dreams of independence
From this family life sentence

Mother seesbut does not read the peeling posters
And can't believe that there's a world to be won
But in the public schools and in the public houses
The Battle of Britain goes on
The constantpromise of jam tomorrow
Is the New Breed's litany and verse
If it takes another war to fill the churches of England
Then the world the meek inherit, what will it be worth

Mother fightsthe tears and Father, his sense of outrage
And attempts to justify the sacrifice
To pass their creed down to another generation
'Anything for the quiet life'
In the Land of a Thousand Doses
Where nostalgia is the opium of the age
Our place in History is as
clock watchers, old timers, window shoppers."

And the government did no less
Until the i.o.u.'s of texas fell on him
Stand tall, billie sol, we don't know you at all
We've taken down your pictures from the wall
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal
We have got to face elections in the fall

Bill had influential friends
He celebrated christmas every day
He filled texas banks with his fertilizer tanks
Influential friends don't die they only fade away
Stand tall, billie sol, we don't know you at all

Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal
We have got to face elections in the fall

And orville freeman sighs
He said ""everyone around was fair and square""
But he was no more convincing
Than ezra taft benson
As resignations cropped up everywhere
Stand tall, billie sol, we don't know you at all
We've taken down your pictures from the wall
Well, we don't want to handle an agriculture scandal
We have got to face elections in the fall

And now I'd like to say
That crime sure doesn't pay
But if you want to make some money on the sly
Well you can always rent
The u.s. government
It's the best one that money can buy.

And an old man pay
The way she took my money
Was a crying shame
 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my watch and chain
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my diamond ring
She took the keys to my Cadillac car
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar
 
Put a detective
On her trail
The post office thought
They'd chase her by the mail
 
She got picked up
And then was put in jail
Stroked the judge
Just to go her bail

She took my watch and chain
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my diamond ring
She took the keys to my Cadillac car
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar
 
She left Detroit
To go to Kalamazoo
Made her a fortune
Out of fools like you
 
Met her a rich man
Who was married and had some kids
Stroked that cat
Until he flipped his lid
 
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my watch and chain
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my diamond ring
She took the keys to my Cadillac car
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar
 
She came back into town
About a week ago
Told me she's sorry
She had hurt me so
 
I had a '65 Ford
And a two dollar bill
The way she took that
Lord, it gave me a thrill

She took my watch and chain
Mary Lou, Mary Lou
She took my diamond ring
She took the keys to my Cadillac car

I guess I'll just go my own way

Every time I take her hand
I keep thinking 'bout no one but you
Each time I hold her it seems to get colder
And I just don't know what to do

Time and time again
Time and time again
Tme and time again
When will I ever learn

Each time I meet a girl
I keep hoping that she'll be like you
But once I know her well
I start looking for somebody new

Time and time again
Time and time again
Tme and time again
When will I ever learn

When will I ever learn
When will I ever learn"

Everybody's doing what you've got to keep on doing for society
Make this world a good place to be
Let livin' be but don't work for free
Playing isn't paying so worx is what I'm saying
Working for the world go round
The battle cry don't mess with me
I've travelled the world for eternity

Warriors of the wasteland
Sailboats of ice on desert sands
Warriors of the wasteland

It seems to be that the powers that be
Keep themselves in splendour and security
Armoured cars for megastars
No streets, no bars, yours wealth is ours
They make the masses, kiss their asse(t)s
Lower class jackass, pay me tax take out the trash
Working for the world go round
Your job is gold, do as you're told
the pay you less the run for congress

Make this a world, a good place to be

Warriors what a waste, man

312,Cro-Mags,Life Of My Own,TRNOUWD128F42541EA,1986,"Memories of the times you had That's the way you see yourself You fight for your rights You fight to survive You come into this world With nothing except yourself You, you leave this world With nothing except yourself Do what you want And how you want it Feel it's right, go out and do it Think for yourself and think for the best Or you'll go down just like the rest You come into this world With nothing except yourself You, you leave this world With nothing except yourself"
313,Charlie Peacock,Waiting on the Perfect Moment,TRKRHXA128F9303A99,1986,"Waiting on the perfect moment
Is a time-consuming task
Like sifting all the sand
Through the hourglass
It’s like looking for a perfect lover
When you know you’re not one yourself
It’s like buying a book you’ve been dying to read 
and then keeping it on the shelf
It’s like hearing a voice that keeps telling you yes
while the whole world’s telling you no

If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time
Because behind every trouble and worry
Could be another one waiting in line
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time

Don’t go looking in a broken mirror
You’ll get a twisted picture back
And every wise woman and man
Knows that that’s a fact
If you’re waiting on a strike of lightning
Or a bell inside to ring
Don’t let it suck you in
It can leave you cold, it’s an all-consuming thing

It’s like hearing a voice that keeps telling you yes
while the whole world’s telling you no
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time
Because behind every trouble and worry
Could be another one waiting in line
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
There may be perfect yet to come
So don’t worry about tomorrow
when today isn’t even done
If you’re waiting on a perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time

It’s like hearing a voice that keeps telling you yes
It’s like the bang of a drum that keeps telling you yes
It’s like a dream in the night that keeps telling you yes
While the whole world’s telling you no
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time
Because behind every trouble and worry
Could be another one waiting in line
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
There may be perfect yet to come
So don’t worry about tomorrow
when today isn’t even done
If you’re waiting on the perfect moment
You might be waiting a long long time
Because behind every trouble and worry
Could be another one waiting in line"
314,Dr Feelgood,I'm A Real Man,TRSMREF128F428E777,1986,"I'm a real man, I got a real guitar
I'm a real man, don't even know where the boys are
Don't want to frighten you little girl, you're so sweet and nice
Don't want to have to tell you twice

I'm a real man
I'm goin' to rock like a real man
Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man?

Yes I'm a real man, baby, I'm not lyin'
I'm thirty-four years old now and I still don't mind dyin'
You can put the voodoo on me, girl
There's nothing I can't dodge
Just check out this roller in my garage

Kids, these days, I'm talkin' about these young folk
About as wild as pollyanna after she growed up
After a hard day at the Casiotone they just don't want to live
They're about as dangerous as a junior executive

I'm a real man
I'm goin' to rock like a real man

Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man?

Every dollar I earn
Girl, I let it all burn
And if I wind up in jail
There's only one of 2672 women that I know
Who would gladly pay my bail

Now you might say I'm just some fool on a boast
But I wasn't gonna hear ya girl from coast to coast
This ain't dan rather talkin', this ain't the president's son
I'm still gonna have my fun

I'm a real man
I'm goin' to rock like a real man
Don't get no shock from that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man? 
Turn off that elevator music in your computer program
How'd you like to rock with a real man? 
Turn off that elevator music, in your computer program
Come on and rock with a real man!"
315,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,The Long Race,TRRQEML128F9314650,1986,"It's a hazy winter's day
And I'm staring out on the southland
In the twilight distance on the bay
My mind sees you running through the marshland
All these years I've been waiting for you
Through the high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I ever be with you?

It's a long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long race
If I try I will surely win it
Some day some night with you

There's a village on the lower Eastern Shore
Where the watermen's boats are anchored
And they work so hard all day long
Showing me what you want to go after
All these years I've been pushing so hard
Through the high times and the low times too
But if I stop now
How could I know what I could do?

It's a long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long race
If I try I will surely win it
Some day some night with you"

Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time
But I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me

I'm making plans for the great escape
The great escape from here
I'm taking off for a better place
and better people who care
And no-one can hear me
No one can hear me (2x)
There's light and there's dark
and sometimes I just can't tell them apart
I'd rather drink a wishing well
if this is the way things are

In the shadows of the night
You're standing on Love Street
On the beat of better things

I'll see you standing there
You don't care anymore
And love in your life
Stabbing knife in my heart

Don't run away

Tell me about your drugs 

Do you wake up on somebody's floor? 
Tell me about your drugs
And you just can't take it anymore?
Tell me about your drugs

Ah, we all get hit by forces that we just don't understand

Do you believe in the Holy Ghost?
Tell me about your drugs
Do you like the things that hurt you most?
Tell me about your drugs 
Do you wish you were somebody else?
Tell me about your drugs 
But you wake up and you're still yourself
Talkin' about your drugs

Ah, we get messed up by forces that we just don't understand

Well, now tell me about your drugs, come on(Bop bop shoo bop, a-wop bop shoo bop)
Why don't you tell me about your drugs?
I'd love to know more about your drugs
Why don't you get intimate about your drugs
Why don't you call me up and go on for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours about your drugs
Tell me Morris 

Do you believe in the endless sleep?
Tell me about your drugs
Do you believe in human sheep?
Tell me about your drugs
WIth their curly little whirly tails?
Tell me about your drugs
So they hang themselves when all else fails
And they're thinkin' about their drugs"

The way you slap my face just fills me with desire 
You play hard to get
'Cause you're teacher's pet 
But when the boats have gone 
We'll take a tumble, excuse for a fumble

Shocked me, too, the things we used to do on grass 
If you fancy, we can buy an ice cream cone 
Your mate has gone, she didn't want to be alone 
I will pounce on you 
Just us and the cuckoos 
You are helpless now 
Over and over, we flatten the clover

Shocked me, too, the things we used to do on grass 
It would shock you, too, the things we used to do on grass 
Grass
On grass
Things we did on grass"
