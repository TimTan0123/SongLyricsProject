0,Billie Holiday,Without Your Love,TRWQDOL12903CB11EB,1937,"Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love
Fine sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

I've rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love"
1,Billie Holiday,I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,TRAAQJE12903C97241,1937,"The snow is snowin'
The wind is blowin'
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm"

Save these chili peppers
Some ol' rainy day, here

Must I shake 'em on down, now

Fix my supper 
Let me go to bed

Must I shake 'em on down.

Woo-well, I got a little woman
In Pinebluff, Arkansas 
She was the sweetest little woman
That your men most ever saw 

Gonna get up in the mo'nin
Baby, with the risin' sun 
Woo-well, in the mo'nin
Baby, with the risin' sun 
If the train don't run
Gonna be some walkin' done 

My baby she's called me
She called me up on the phone 
Woo-well, she called me
She called me up on the phone 

She said ,'Daddy, daddy'

My baby says, 'I'm tired goin' to bed and moan'

4,Fred Astaire,They Can't Take That Away From Me,TRMIUTB128F145DE12,1937,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by the morrow, you're gone.
The song is ended, but as the song-writer wrote,
The melody lingers on. 

They may take you from me.
I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me
I'll still possess...

The way you wear your hat.
The way you sip your tea.
The memory of all that
Oh, no. They can't take that away from me.

The way your smile just beams.
The way you sing off-key.
The way you haunt my dreams.
No, no. They can't take that away from me.

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love.
But I'll always, always keep 
The memory of...

The way you hold your knife.
The way we danced till three.
The way you changed my life.
No, no. They can't take that away from me.
No, they can't take that away from me."
5,Fred Astaire,Things Are Looking Up,TRSWYUS128F426E864,1937,"If I should suddenly start to sing
Or stand on my head or anything
Don't think that I've lost my senses
It's just that my happiness finally commences

The long, long ages of dull despair
Are turning into thin air
And it seems that suddenly
I've become the happiest man alive

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it's covered with four leaf clovers
Oh, things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh, things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

See the sunbeams?
Every one beams just because of you
Love's in session
And my depression is unmistakably through

Things are looking up
It's a great little world we live in
Oh, I'm as happy as a pup
Since love looked up at me"
6,Fred Astaire,Nice Work If You Can Get It,TRYOQOC12903C9628A,1937,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny.
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that tiem won't erase his name.

The fact is,
The only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl-and-boy-ment.
Fall in love, you won't regret it.
That's the best work of all if you can get it.

Holdin' hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Oh â€“ Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
For it is
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waitin' at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Do,do,do...

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

Holdin' hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
And strollin' with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Da-da-da-da

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?"
7,Peetie Wheatstraw,Crazy With The Blues,TRTYRWX128F930B7BF,1937,"I waked up this mornin'
Just crazy with the blues
I waked up this mornin'
Just crazy with the blues
I can't even tell
Hoo, well, well the different in my shoes

I am just a crazy fool
I can't do a thing
Just a crazy fool
I can't do a thing
I am just jumpin' around here
Hoo, hoo, well, well, now
Just like a monkey on a end of a string

I went downtown this mornin'
With my hat on upside down
Went downtown this mornin'
My hat on upside down
Ah, people looked at me
Like they thought
That I was a country clown

I heard somebody call me
It was a policeman on his beat
I heard somebody call me
It was a policeman on his beat

Well, well, now he just wanted to tell me
Ohh, well, well
That I was drivin' on the wrong
Side of the street

Folks, I'll keep on tellin' you
That I'm just so crazy with the blues

Play it just a little bit boys, that's good

Folks, I just keep on tellin' you
I'm just a crazy with the blues
I'm goin' to the railroad down to the river
Woo, well, but I don't know
Which one that I will choose"
8,Tampa Red,Travel On,TRKGALH12903D1206E,1937,"When you are doing
The best you can
And the one you loving
Don't understand
Don't get discouranged
But keep-a tryin' and travel on

You're bound to worry
Ev'ry now and then
But keep on trying
You are bound to win
Don't get discouranged
But keep-a tryin' and travel on

If you stay worried
Most all the time
Just try laughing instead of cryin'
Don't get discouraged
But keep-a tryin' and travel on

'Yas, yas'

Yo' darkest hour is just before day
That's when your sorrows
Will vanish away
Don't get discouranged
But keep-a tryin' and travel on

When you get worried
And feel so blue
Remember this song, I
Have sung to you
Don't get discouranged
But keep-a tryin' and travel on."
