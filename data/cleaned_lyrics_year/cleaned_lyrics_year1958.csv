0,Abbey Lincoln,It's Magic,TRZVJZF128F932058B,1958,"You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic

Without a golden wand or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows when there isn't rain?
It's magic

Why do I tell me myself these things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know the magic is my love for you?

It's magic
It's magic"
1,Abbey Lincoln,Exactly Like You,TRNLFJU128F9320597,1958,"I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you

Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Yes she knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you"
2,Betty Carter,Babe's Blues,TRKXBHH128F1499016,1958,"Small children pound
Babe's blues around
Blues made them cry

Unlike adults
Have fewer faults
And as a rule
They're pretty cool

They meet blues
They greet blues
Then beat blues

Kids take a fall
But like a ball
Bounce up again

They'll shed a tear
Too full of fear
They're not afraid
They've got it made

Kids meet blues
Then greet blues
And beat blues

Small girls and boys
Treat blues as toys
Like in a game

Blues come their way
Most every day
Kids let them in
Don't let them win

Kids make blues
Then fake blues
Then shake blues

(24 bars scat)
(24 bars horn solo)

We tiny todds
Scat blues a lot
But never grieve

Kids in the know
When feeling low
Cries blues away
Don't let them stay

Kids spy blues
Kids eye blues
Goodbye blues

Kids make blues
Then fake blues
Then shake blues

Kids make blues
Then fake blues
Then shake blues"

Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you want to dance?

Do you do you do you do you want to dance
Do you do you do you do you want to dance

Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night

4,Brenda Lee,Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,TRMKYIS128F422BB25,1958,"Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly""
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly""
Deck the halls with boughs of holly

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way"

You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he sat and waited by the billiabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came a jumbuck to drink beside the billabong
Up jumped the swagman and seized him with glee
And he sang as he talked to that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he talked to that jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came the stockman riding on his thorough bred
Down came the troopers, one, two, three
Wheres that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
Wheres that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Up jumped the swagman, plunged into the billabong
You'll never catch me alive cried he
And his ghost may be heard as you ride beside the billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

12,Charlie Walker,Pick Me Up On Your Way Down,TRMQKAW128F427E1FC,1958,"You were mine for just awhile
Now you're putting on the style
And you never once looked back
At your home across the track

You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When there glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong

You maybe their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down

They have changed your attitude
Made you honey and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame
Underneath your still the same

When you learn these things are true
I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all alone
When there glamor starts to boar you
Come on back where you belong

You maybe their pride and joy
But they'll find another toy
And they'll take away your crown
Pick me up on your way down"

15,Chuck Berry,Johnny B. Goode,TRWKHVC12903CDF947,1958,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh my, but that little country boy could play""

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

His mother told him, ""Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'""

You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

And if you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin'
Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You can't dance, I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby, 'cause you dance so good

Then flips my crazy heart right over
You, angel baby, you

Who is the chick I would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for me to kiss
Who is the girl who can curl me around her finger when we kiss again
Who can imagine what I'd give for Angel baby
Just for the chance to love and live for
You, angel baby, you

(Angel baby) you're mine forever
(Angel baby) you, angel baby, you
(Who is the chick he would pick as the absolutely perfect miss for him to kiss)

Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want your love to share

I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do.

I told my friends that we would never part
They laughed and said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part

When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do."

My heart is breaking but no one knows
Friends won't learn the truth from me
I don't want their sympathy
You go to parties, dances and shows
I still love you but no one knows
Maybe some how, some time, some where
You'll walk by and hear my prayer
My loneliness will fade away
Darling please tell me you'll stay
But if you should pass me by
I'll be hurt but I won't cry
And though my love for you still grows
I feel it's better if no one knows"

A beautiful melody from some enchanted land

Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go?

When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain - come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in - day out"

55,Frank Sinatra,Willow Weep For Me,TREWJRN128F1457414,1958,"Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me

Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Left my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide its starry light
So none will see me sighing and crying all alone

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me

Oh, Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, hear me willow and weep for me"
56,Frank Sinatra,Everybody Loves Somebody,TREGUUU128F92F6E1C,1958,"Writer(s): Taylor/Lane 


Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
(That) My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
(That) My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you"
57,Frank Sinatra,If You Are But A Dream,TRJUFCB128F92F76E0,1958,"Writer(s): Moe Jaffe - Jack Fulton - Nat Bonx 


If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken,
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken.

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you,
And pray my dream comes true.

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare,
I'm so a-fraid that
You may vanish in the air,

So darling,
If our romance would break up,
I hope I never wake up,
If you are but a dream."

Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here and we're gone

Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark

What - though love is old
What - though song is old
Through them we can be young

Hear this heart of mine
Wailin' all the time
Dear one, tell me that we're one

Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark, dancing in the dark

You haven't gambled at all.

So they call me a moonlight gambler.
Well, I've gambled for love and lost.
When I gamble for love but it isn't in the cards,
Oh, what heartaches it can cost me.

Win or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler,
And a winner is what I long to be.
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live,
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me.

Well, you can gamble for match sticks,

Cependant que je pêche et que je m'ennoblis
Ma femme sacrifie à sa vieille habitude
De faire, à tout venant, les honneurs de mon lit

Eh ! oui, je suis cocu, j'ai du cerf sur la tête
On fait force de trous dans ma lune de miel
Ma bien-aimée ne m'invite plus à la fête
Quand ell' va faire un tour jusqu'au septième ciel

Au péril de mon cœur, la malheureuse écorne
Le pacte conjugal et me le déprécie
Que je ne sache plus où donner de la corne
Semble bien être le cadet de ses soucis

Les galants de tout poil viennent boire en mon verre
Je suis la providence des écornifleurs
On cueille dans mon dos la tendre primevère
Qui tenait le dessus de mon panier de fleurs

En revenant fourbu de la pêche à la ligne
Je les surprends tout nus dans leurs débordements
Conseillez-leur le port de la feuille de vigne
Ils s'y refuseront avec entêtement

Souiller mon lit nuptial, est-c' que ça les empêche
De garder les dehors de la civilité ?
Qu'on me demande au moins si j'ai fait bonne pêche
Qu'on daigne s'enquérir enfin de ma santé

De grâce, un minimum d'attentions délicates
Pour ce pauvre mari qu'on couvre de safran
Le cocu, d'ordinaire, on le choie, on le gâte
On est en fin de compte un peu de ses parents

A l'heure du repas, mes rivaux détestables
Ont encor ce toupet de lorgner ma portion
Ça leur ferait pas peur de s'asseoir à ma table
Cocu, tant qu'on voudra, mais pas amphitryon

Partager sa moitié, est-c' que cela comporte
Que l'on partage aussi la chère et la boisson ?
Je suis presque obligé de les mettre à la porte
Et bien content s'ils n'emportent pas mes poissons

Bien content qu'en partant ces mufles ne s'égarent
Pas à mettre le comble à leur ignominie

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
'Fraid she's gone forever more

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""I took your baby from you away
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear
There in the breakers I saw her near
Reached for my darlin', held her to me
Stole her away from the angry sea

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
""You took your baby from me away""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep
I saved my baby from an endless sleep""

Endless sleep, endless sleep"

And you never see a show
Friends drop by to pick you up
And you hardly ever go
It seems your head in in the clouds above
You've got the ways of a woman in love

I walk by your house at night
In the hopes that I might see
The guy who's got you in a spin
I wish that guy was me
I don't know why it's you I'm dreamin' of
You've got the ways of a woman in love

Many is the night
I've stayed awake and cried
Now you'll never know how much
You've hurt my foolish pride

I recall your kisses
The times I held you tight
Now when I come to see you
You're sittin' in the light
Missing all the things that we dreamed of
You've got the ways of a woman in love."

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

There you go, you're gone again
I should have known, I couldn't win
There you go, you're by his side
You're gonna break another heart, you're gonna tell another lie

Because I love you so I take much more than I should take
I want you even though I know my heart is gonna break
You build me up and for a while I'm all a-glow

A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin'
In spite of the chill in the weather
Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time

Then your lips cling to mine, it's wonderful, wonderful

Sometimes we stand, on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky.
I turn to you, and you melt in my arms
Here we are, Darling, only you and I.
What a moment to share, it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.

The world is full of wondrous things, it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you.

Some quiet evening, I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own.
I feel the glow of your arms open love
I'm aware of the treasure that I hold.
And I say to myself ""It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love.'

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the the East, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last

Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again

But deliver us from ee-vill:
For thine is the kingdom,
And the power, and the glo-o-ry,
Forever, A-a-a-main."

So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel.
I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of adventures and battles,
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?

Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me feel I'm home.
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.

With a guard at every door
And the vaults are made of silver
That the workers sweated for"

Me curly hair is getting thin – it’s all them women and wine
But I’m oh so ashamed
It’s been three weeks since I had
A record in the top twenty pops

It hurts me when I thinks as how at eight I was top of the pole
They screamed  every time I just opened me mouth and rocked in the aisles with me roll
Now  I’m oh so ashamed
They all say me discs are flops
‘Cos I haven’t got a record in the top twenty pops

I’ve tried ooh-aahs and I’ve giggled
I’ve rocked it and I’ve skiffled
I’ve sung an old song and not no-one could make out a word
It’s the truth!
I’ve clapped me hands ‘til the blood run
I’ve had echoes til me head spun
Til me head spun
Til me head spun
But they say you’re too old, too long in the tooth
Give us youth!

I’ve had me breakdown in the papers
Dyed me hair a luminous green
I’ve wobbled me hips in sexy-like capers
And me sideboards meet under me chin
But I’m oh so ashamed
It’s been three weeks since I had
A record in the top twenty pops

I’ve held high notes, real classy
Til me eyes went all glassy
I’ve sung a duet with meself  - nearly ruptured me throat
I’ve tried humming and hot drumming
I’ve broke ten guitars with me strumming
But it always turns out some Charlie has done it before

What’s the matter with me platters, they say I should try a new kick
But me nerves is hanging in tatters, I’ve done me nut til I’m fair off me wick
And I’m oh so ashamed
It’s been three weeks since I had
A record in the top twenty pops
Me discs are slipping!
I haven’t got a record in the top twenty pops
Please buy this record.  Please!"

Quand t'auras douze belles dans la peau,
deux duchesses et dix dactylos
Qu'est ce que t'auras de plus sinon,
sinon qu'un peu de plomb
Un peu de plomb dans l'aile,
pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand t'auras claqué ton grisbi
dans toutes les boîtes à coup de fusil
Tu ne seras jamais qu'un pigeon
avec un peu de plomb
Un peu de plomb dans l'aile,
pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand dans le feu de la passion,
aux échelles des bas nylons
Tu grimperas, tu grimperas,
après, qu'est ce que t'auras ?
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile,
pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand t'auras aimé à tout vent,
et que tes poules n'auront plus de dents
Pour te bouffer l'cœur dans la main,
hé bien mon gros malin
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile,
pas plus dans la cervelle

Et quand t'auras passé ta vie
derrière les barreaux de ton lit
Tu diras que tu t'en es payé,
et oui, et puis après
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile,
pas plus dans la cervelle

Mais p't'être bien qu'tu ne feras pas de vieux os,
avec tes douze belles dans la peau,

un gars qui t'enverra

et il t'poussera des ailes"

Des types bien sapés te f'ront du baise-main
Tu f'ras des sourires, tu joueras ton rôle
Mais tu n'seras jamais qu'une petite putain

Putain des trottoirs, putain des palaces
Pour les mecs dans l'fond, c'est le même tabac
On lui paye son prix, on s'en débarrasse
Faut qu'elle fasse l'amour et pas d'embarras
D'ailleurs un beau jour, ma bath petite môme
Faudra qu'tu t'décides à passer la main
Alors en chialant, tu t'diras qu'ma pomme
Elle avait du bon en tant qu'écrivain

C'est tout ce que t'auras, mes vers à la gomme
Ma littérature dont tu t'es foutue
C'est tout ce que t'auras pour t'rappeler les hommes
Tes anciens mordus qui t'regarderont plus

Sur canapé, laissez s'asseoir et se détendre
Versez une larme de porto
Et puis mettez-vous au piano
Jouez Chopin
Avec dédain
Égrenez vos accords
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jetez-le dehors

Le second soir, faites revenir ce cœur bien tendre
Faites mijoter trois bons quarts d'heure à vous attendre
Et s'il n'est pas encore parti
Soyez-en sûr, c'est qu'il est cuit
Sans vous trahir
Laissez frémir
Faites attendre encore
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jetez-le dehors

Le lendemain, il ne tient qu'à vous d'être tendre
Tamisez toutes les lumières et sans attendre
Jouez la farce du grand amour
Dites « jamais », dites « toujours »
Et consommez
Sur l'canapé
Mais après les transports
Ah ! s'il s'endort
Alors là, foutez-le dehors !"

Des horizons j'en ai pas lourd
Quand j'ai bossé toute la journée

Qu'les fleurs horribles de ma chambre

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
J'ai mis une croix sur mes amours
Les p'tites pépées pour les toucher
Faut d'abord les allonger
Sinon c'est froid comme en décembre

Quand le soir venu m'en reviens du chantier
Après mille peines et le corps harassé
J'ai le regard mort et les mains dégueulasses
D'quoi inciter les belles à faire la grimace
Bien sûr, y a les filles de joie sur le retour
Celles qui mâchent le chewing-gum pendant l'amour
Mais que trouverais-je dans leur corps meurtri
Sinon qu'indifférence et mélancolie
Dans mes frusques couleur de muraille
Je joue les épouvantails

Mais nom de Dieu dans mon âme
Brûlait pourtant cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Où se consumaient mes amours
Comme autant de feux de paille

Aujourd'hui je fais mon chemin solitaire
Toutes mes ambitions se sont faites la paire
J'me suis laissé envahir par les orties
Par les ronces de cette chienne de vie

Mes illusions donnent sur la cour
Mais dans les troquets du faubourg
J'ai des ardoises de rêveries
Et le sens de l'ironie
Je m'laisse aller à la tendresse

J'oublie ma chambre au fond d'la cour
Le train de banlieue au petit jour
Et dans les vapeurs de l'alcool
J'vois mes châteaux espagnols
Mes haras et toutes mes duchesses

À moi les p'tites pépées, les poupées jolies
Laissez venir à moi les petites souris
Je claque tout ce que je veux au baccara
Je tape sur le ventre des Maharajas
À moi les boîtes de nuit sud-américaines
Où l'on danse la tête vide et les mains pleines
À moi ces mignonnes au regard qui chavire
Qu'il faut agiter avant de s'en servir
Dans mes pieds-de-poule, mes prince-de-galles
En douce j'me rince la dalle

Eh nom de Dieu dans mon âme
V'là qu'je ressens cette flamme
Où s'éclairaient mes amours
Et mes brèves fiançailles
Où se consumaient mes amours
Comme autant de feux de paille

Et quand les troquets ont éteint leurs néons
Qu'il n'reste plus un abreuvoir à l'horizon
Ainsi j'me laisse bercer par le calva
Et le dieu des ivrognes guide mes pas
Le dieu des ivrognes guide mes pas"

But that's not the reason that I came to land
""I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.""

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater

Sure looks strange to me

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
And he started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
""Sing a boop boop aboopa lopa lum bam boom""

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater

161,Tito Puente,Cuando Te Vea,TRZOVMM128F931FAFD,1958,"Mañana cuando yo te vea
Permite, que pueda explicarte
Los momentos de amargura
Que pase por ti mujer

Yo comprendo, soy un hombre
Lo que quiero nena linda
Es disculparte
Por los momentos de amargura
Que pase por ti mujer

Yo comprendo, soy un hombre
Lo que quiero nena linda
Es disculparte
Por los momentos de amargura
Que pase por ti mujer

Cuando te vea
Fuiste mala mala why embustera
Cuando te vea
Mañana por la mañana

Cuando te vea
Te fuiste de mi vida mujer bandolera
Cuando te vea"
