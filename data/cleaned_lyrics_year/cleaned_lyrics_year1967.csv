0,Jimmy Ruffin,Gonna Give Her All The Love I've Got,TRAHEYG128F1464032,1967,"There's a train leaving here tomorrow. (Leaving here) And I'll be a free, free man once again. (A free man) I'm so glad I served my time, I'm gonna meet the girl that I left behind. And when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got. Ooo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got. There were times, there were times when each day seems like a year. But the sweet things she said in her letters, made the times disappear, oh yeah. She said, No one's arms will I let hold me 'cause in your arms is where I want to be. So when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got. Ooo, when I see her... (I'm gonna give her all) all the love I've got. Ooo, baby, baby, baby, I miss you so. Ugh! Hmmm (Aw) Countless nights I stared out my window at the moonlight, yes I did now. Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight, oh yeah. I must've been out of my mind to do the wrong I did and leave her behind. So when I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got. Woo, when I see her, I'm gonna give her, little girl, all the love I've got. Believe me when I tell ya When I see her, I'm gonna give her all the love I've got."
1,Wilson Pickett,Time Is On My Side (LP Version),TRFZRRF128F147C6EC,1967,"Time is on my side, yes, it is.
Time is on my side, yes, it is.
Now you were saying that you want to be free
But you'll come running back; you'll come running back,
You'll come running back to me.

Time is on my side, yes, it is.
Time is on my side, yes, it is.
You're searching for good times but just wait and see,
You'll come running back; you'll come running back,
You'll come running back to me.

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town!
Baby do everything your heart desires.
Remember, I'll always be around.
And I know like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back, baby..
You're gonna come back knocking right on my door.

Time is on my side, yes, it is.
Time is on my side, yes, it is.
'Cause I got the real love, the kind that you need.
You'll come running back, you'll come running back,
You'll come running back to me.

Time, time, time is on my side, yes, it is.
Time is on my side, yes, it is."
2,The Sonics,I'm Going Home,TRCVSDY12903CFD7C6,1967,"When I was a boy I had a mind of my own
Told my folks I was leaving home
Mamma, pappa told me, son you better not go
Packed my things and started to go

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home

You can see I didn't do so good
I'm half as well as I thought I could
The big cities all treat me bad
I've gone back to my mom and dad

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home

-MOUTH HARP SOLO-

This ruming life has done me wrong
I haven't eat' right for oh so long
Been living a life of hate and pain
Gonna jump unpon the next rail train

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home"
3,Jefferson Airplane,Plastic Fantastic Lover,TRSZPCO128F9300129,1967,"Her neon mouth with the blinkers-off smile
Nothing but an electric sign
You could say she has an individual style
She's part of a colorful time

Secrecy of lady-chrome-covered clothes
You wear cause you have no other
But I suppose no one knows
You're my plastic fantastic lover

Her rattlin' cough never shuts off
Is nothin' but a used machine
Her aluminum finish, slightly diminished
Is the best I ever have seen

Cosmetic baby plugged into me
I'd never ever find another
I realize no one's wise
To my plastic fantastic lover

The electrical dust is starting to rust
Her trapezoid thermometer taste
All the red tape is mechanical rape
Of the TV program waste

Data control and IBM
Science is mankind's brother
But all I see is drainin' me
On my plastic fantastic lover"
4,Jimmy Ruffin,I've Passed This Way Before,TRGSYBA128F1477A14,1967,"Life lends a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end 
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart 
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end 
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started 
But this time I know the way 
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality 
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end 
Has found my poor heart again"
5,Peter_ Paul and Mary,The Great Mandella (The Wheel Of Life) (LP Version),TRESRDB128F92F319E,1967,"So I told him
That he'd better
Shut his mouth
And do his job like a man.
And he answered,
""Listen, father,
I will never 
Kill another""
He thinks he's better
Than his brother that died.
What the hell does
He think he's doing
To his father
Who brought him up right?

Take your place on
The Great Mandella
As it moves through your brief moment of time.
Win or lose now,
You must choose now,
And if you lose you're only losing your life.

Tell the jailor
Not to bother
With his meal
Of bread and water today.
He is fasting
Till the killing's over.
He's a martyr.
He thinks he's a prophet
But he's a coward.
He's just playing a game.
He can't do it,
He can't change it.
It's been going on for ten thousand years.

Take your place on
The Great Mandella
As it moves through your brief moment of time.
Win or lose now,
You must choose now,
And if you lose you're only losing your life.

Tell the people
They are safe now.
Hunger stopped him.
He lies still in his cell.
Death has gagged his accusations.
We are free now.
We can kill now.
We can hate now.
Now we can end the world.
We're not guilty.
He was crazy,
And it's been going on for ten thousand years!

Take your place on
The Great Mandella
As it moves through your brief moment of time.
Win or lose now,
You must choose now.
And if you lose you've only wasted your life."
6,Porter Wagoner,The Cold Hard Facts Of Life,TRVPOYN128F92FC00D,1967,"I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life
I passed a little wine store on the corner 
I pictured pink champagne by candlelight
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say ""You know the rest""
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block till I was dizzy 
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Lord you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried please put away that knife
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in the cell
But who taught who the cold hard facts of life
Who taught who the cold hard facts of life"
7,The Sonics,On The Road Again,TRBHHGM12903CFD7C3,1967,"Sebastian

I woke up this mornin, looked around my four walls
And a dream told me you aint happy at all
I packed up my bags, I took my last look and then
Look out, pretty mom, Im on the road again

Im on the road again
(Just as sure as youre born)
Im on the road again
(Just as sure as youre born)
Look out, pretty mom, Im on the road again
I ran home last night to get my dinner hot
I pulled on my door and found the door was locked
I jumped through the window and believe it or not
She had not even put my dinner in the pot
Ive never been evil and Ive never been sly
But if I sit some place and let the time roll by
I start to get restless, pack my bags up and then
Look out pretty mom, Im on the road again"
8,Small Faces,(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me,TRGQMDY128F92EC4DB,1967,"I've a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
Through it all I've been here without you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)

Words seem out of place, all my life I've known your face
Have you ever seen me, have you ever seen me?

Many flowers are breaking through the concrete (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Listen everybody I can hear them breathing (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
I felt I got a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I got to know have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)"
9,The Stone Poneys,One For One,TRFMYVD128F1457E82,1967,"If I hadn't grown with you
And if half my life had been spent
When we came together
Would it be different
Are you any more like you
Though I know that I've asked before
I'm sure there're quite a few like me
Why should I be different
Is it true that there's just one for one like I've been told

So hard to tell truth from lies
With young eyes of innocence
The glass slipper, the prince's kiss
They make no difference
I thought I knew what I knew
I thought that I knew what they meant
So so soon too late I realize
A meaning so different
Is it true that there's just one for one like I've been told

The highway ends at the iron fence
Where the diesel trucks march by
The sounds of living can make no sense
When they make no difference

Wooden boxes cause a throne
The hollow faces beneath the stone
And all the blank ones on their way home
I see no difference
Is it true that there's just one for one like I've been told"
10,Scott McKenzie,Reason To Believe,TRCWAGJ128F9320963,1967,"If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe.

Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think about myself.

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe.

If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe."
11,Small Faces,Something I Want To Tell You,TRHMJCB128F92EC4A6,1967,"I've got something I want to tell you
I've got something I want to say
All the things that you say and do girl
Don't you know that they're not my way
I don't like what you're running after
It's not me that you're thinking of
You forget what we've found together 
You forget what we've found is love

The light in your eyes has faded
And your voice has another tone
I have cried all my tears already
Once again I am all alone
I got something I want to tell you
I got something I want to say"
12,The Temptations,The Impossible Dream,TRTWYQJ12903C9FDB1,1967,"To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afat
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
The fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
To fight the unbeatable foe
To dream the impossible dream"
13,Pink Floyd,Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk (Stereo) (2007 Digital Remaster),TRSHAYC128F422CF5B,1967,"Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread

Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red

Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spool, June gloom

Why do you go?

And now

Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor, kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive, flowers thrive
Realise, realise
Realise"
14,The Everly Brothers,I'm Finding It Rough,TRWXPZS12903C9A846,1967,"I'm here at home sitting all my own
No-one to talk to now I know you have gone
What a fool I have been to myself
I'm finding it rough with you not lovin' me now-no more

Sitting thinking just what steps I have to take
No idea just how long you'll make me wait
Have your way, I give in to let you win
'Cause I'm finding it rough with you not lovin' me now-no more

I can't believe you can manage on your own
Can't believe that you can bear it all alone
I'm here at home sitting all my own
No-one to talk to now I know you have gone
What a fool I have been to myself
I'm finding it rough with you not lovin' me now-no more

I can't believe you can manage on your own
Can't believe that you can bear it all alone
I'm finding it rough - I'm finding it rough
I'm finding it rough - I'm finding it rough
I'm finding it rough - I'm finding it rough
I'm finding it rough - I'm finding it rough"
15,Sonny & Cher,The Beat Goes On,TRYXPIB12903CBFFCD,1967,"The beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

Charleston was once the rage, uh huh. 
History has turned the page, uh huh. 
The miniskirt's the current thing, uh huh. 
Tennybopper is our newborn king, uh huh. 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

The grocery store's the supermart, uh huh. 
Little girls still break their hearts, uh huh. 
And men still keep on marching off to war. 
Electrically they keep a baseball score. 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da. 

Grandmas sit in chairs and reminisce 
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss. 
The cars keep going faster all the time. 
Bums still cry 'Hey buddy, have you got a dime?' 

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on. 
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain. 
La de da de de, la de da de da"
16,The Velvet Underground,I'm Waiting For The Man,TRDHBOF128F9321634,1967,"I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, one-two-five
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man

Hey, white boy, what you doing uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasing our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man

Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
I'm waiting for my man

Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody-body's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Aw, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man

Baby don't you holler, darling don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
Walk me home"
17,The Rolling Stones,Sing This All Together (See What Happens),TRHUUBR128F429D515,1967,"Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 

Pictures of us through the steamy haze 
Picture of us painted in our place 

Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 

Why don't we sing this song all together 
Open our heads let the pictures come 
And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from 

Pictures of us beating on our drum 
Never stopping til the rain has come 

Why don't we sing this song all together

And if we close all our eyes together 
Then we will see where we all come from"

22,Buffalo Springfield,Broken Arrow,TRDWVLD128F9316496,1967,"The lights turned on and the curtain fell down
And when it was over, it felt like a dream
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
The agents had paid for the black limousine 
That waited outside in the rain
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

Eighteen years of American dream
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
His mother had told him a trip was a fall
And don't mention babies at all
Did you see him, did you see him?
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

The streets were lined for the wedding parade
The queen wore the white gloves, the county of song
The black-covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her king from the sun rays of dawn
They married for peace and were gone
Did you see them, did you see them?
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?"

That broke it in two like it was clay 
I should have known better 
I should have never let her 
But I couldn't break free 
I gave her all my love so generously 
Big hearted me 

Big hearted me,big hearted me 
I bought her everything 
A mink and a ring 
A home so fine 
I thought she loved me so 
There never was a doubt that she was mine 
Until one day I opened my eyes and plain as could be 
My love was all gone 
She left me all alone

Says she doesn't care no more
Think I'll throw it on the floor

Got your cable just today
Tell the girl what I've got to say..ay

25,Jefferson Airplane,The Ballad Of You And Me and Pooneil,TRZNAHF128F4268F50,1967,"If you were a bird and you lived very high,
knew even the wind as the breeze came by,
say to the wind as it took you away,
That's where I wanted to go today""
And I do know that I need to have you around

Love like a mountain springtime,
flashing through the rivers of my mind;
it's what I feel for you.

You and me go walking south
And we see all the world around us,
The colors blind my eyes and my mind to all but you,
And I do know that I need to have you around,
And I do, I do know that I need to have you around.

I have a house where I can go
When there's too many people around me;
I can sit and watch all the people
Down below goin' by me;
Halfway down the stair is a stair
Where I sit and think about you and me;

But I wonder will the sun still see all the people goin' by
Will the moon still hang in the sky when I die,
When I die, when I'm high, when I die?

If you were a cloud and you sailed up there,
You sail on water as blue as air,
You'd see me here in the fields and say,
""Doesn't the sky look green today?"""

Try'na make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old,
Try'na to make herself a bride?
So what becomes of you my love,
When they have finally stripped you of,
The handbags and the gladrags,
That your grandads had to sweat so you could buy?
Baby.  Bye bye.

Once I was a young man and all I thought
All I had to do was smile,
Baby
You are still a young girl,
And you bought everything in style.
But once you think you're in, you're out,
'Cause you don't mean a thing without,
The handbags and the gladrags,
That your grandads had to sweat so you could buy.
Baby.  Bye bye.

We-e-ell
Sing a song of sixpence for your sake,
And take a bottle full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake,
And bake them all in a pie,
They told me you missed school today,
So I suggest you just throw away,
The handbags and the gladrags,
That your grandads had to sweat so you could buy,

Hey hey,
They told me you missed school today,
So I suggest you just throw them all away,
The handbags and the gladrags,
That your grandads had to sweat so you could buy.

Oh, bye bye."

She'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh, when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
Cause I've left that girl, so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch,
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry, just to think, I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know,
I would really go"

Settlin' down and becomin' my little wife

Well I've been fed that line before
And I can't digest that kinda talk anymore
You guessed it honey I'm tellin' you bye bye bye
Cause I'm just a little bit woman shy 

The last three women I cared anything about
They all lied to me and told me the same old thing
With one I made a whole lot of plans
Hired a preacher rented a church and bought a big ole diamond ring

But I got to the church what did I find
She's made off with preacher and that diamond ring of mine
Well that's one reason why
This old boy's still a little bit woman shy 

Mhm I'm a woman shy woman shy
I'd like to fall in love but I'm afraid to try
Cause I'm a woman shy woman shy
Everone I ever love told me a lie

But honey you've done wonders for my vanity
And your sweet love has soothed my manly pride
A gal like you could make me lose my sanity
If you'd just half way give it a try

So I better run cause it's plain to see
I hang around here you'll get your hooks into me
But if I ever marry you're the one I'm gonna try
But right now I'm just a little bit woman shy

Yes I'm a woman shy woman shy
I'm just a little bit woman shy mhm yeah"

Behind volumes of literature based on herself
And runs across the pages like some tiny elf
Knowing that it's hard to find
Stuff way back in her mind,
Winds up spending all of her time
Trying to memorize every line

Sweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine. 
Sweet lady of death wants me to die
So she can come sit by my bedside and sigh
And wipe away the tears from all my friends eyes
Then softly she will explain
Just exactly who was to blame
For causing me to go insane
And finally blow out my brain,
Sweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine. 

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways,
Ah, 'bout country ways. 

The joy of life she dresses in black
With celestial secrets engraved in her back
And her face keeps flashing that she's got the knack,
But you know when you look into her eyes
All she's learned she's had to memorize
And the only way you'll ever get her high
Is to let her do her thing and then watch you die,
Sweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine. 

Now she's the one who gives us all those magical things
And reads us stories out of the I Ching,
Then she passes out a whole new basket of rings
That when you put on your hand
Makes you one of the Angel Band
And gives you the power to be a man,
But what it does for her you never quite understand
Sweet Lorraine, ah, sweet Lorraine. 

Well you know that it's a shame and a pity
You were raised up in the city
And you never learned nothing 'bout country ways,
Oh 'bout country ways, oh 'bout country ways,
Yeah, about country ways, oh, country ways ..."

They hold each other tight
As they dance under love till the morning light
The soft embraces that they seem to share
Just make me feel aware
Of the loneliness I find so hard to bear

I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who'll care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, help me, please

For someone's love, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Had a childhood sweetheart,
We were always hand in hand.

I was high-top shoes and shirt tails,
Suzy was in pig tails,
I know I loved her even then.

You know my papa disapproved it,
My mama boohooed it,
But I told them time and time again,
""Don't you know I was made to love her,
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey.

She's been my inspiration,
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years.

Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly,
My life grew sweeter through the years.

I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years.

I was made to love her,
Worship and adore her,
Hey, hey, hey.

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!

My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere.

I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year.

Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there.

'Cause I was made to love her,
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Ah, I was made to love her,
Built my world all around her,
Hey, hey, hey.

Oo baby, I was made to please her,
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no,

60,Joan Baez,Annabel Lee,TRAWQQX128F92F219D,1967,"It was many and many a year ago, 
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and SHE was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love-
I and my ANNABEL LEE-
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that,long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud,chilling
My  ANNABEL LEE;
So that her high-born kinsmen came 
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.
AND the angels,not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me-
Yes!-that was the reason(as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)             
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling my ANNABEL LEE;
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Killing my ANNABELLEE.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we-
Of many far wiser than we-
And neither the angels in heaven above 
Nor the the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:                                         And the moon never beams,without bringing me
dreams
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
And the stars never rise,but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE:
And so,all the night-tide,I lie down by the side
Of my darling my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea-
In her tomb by the sounding sea."

And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells

Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch

Lying awake, late the other night
Heard above me a trembling,
I looked up, it was a little cloud,
From which a gold string was dangling;
You know, I gave the string a little pull,
Just to see what was on the other end.
Just then a voice came down to me, says,
""Hey, now, don't you want to be my friend,

And float with me to distant lands,
wondrous and fair;
Float with me to distant lands wondrous and fair?
You see I'm just a happy little cloud,
I laugh and float and sing my song,
But the other clouds don't like me none.
They say I am behaving very wrong.
You see a cloud's supposed to be sad,
To cry and weep and tear its hair and all,
And don't matter how hard I try,
I can't get the first little tear to fall.""

And float with me to distant lands, wondrous and fair;
Float with me to distant lands, wondrous and fair;

I said, ""Hey, I like you little cloud,
You are a nice little fellow, yes.""
""You making some, kind of a joke?"", said the cloud,
""Now can't you see I'm wearing such a pretty dress?
You see I am the prettiest little chick cloud
That you'd find anywhere up above.
I just dropped in on you awhile
To see if you could give me some kind of love.""

And float with me to distant lands, wondrous and fair;
Float with me to distant lands wondrous and fair;

Just then the chief cloud come into view
And says, ""Hey, girl, now what you think you're doing there?
I told you so many times before
You just don't seem at all to care.
You know you should be floating up above, now
Don't let me catch you down here again.""

And as my cloud pulled out of view,
There come failing down a gentle shower of rain.
Happy rain come failing down,
Red, green, blue and golden.
And every drop, as it fell, it smiled
And, throwing back its head, began singing,

""Oh float with me to distant lands, wondrous and fair;
Float with me to distant lands, wondrous and fair."""

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you

Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound till tomorrow

Float on a river forever and ever

That I never bought till we started drifting apart
Now I know the love that you give
Is something that I've got to kiss

Got to make comeback
To your heart

I realize, the love light is lost
There's no greater cross to bear
Than the pain of a broken heart
Now I know that I've got to pay, every night and day

Got to make comeback
To your heart

Now, girl, oh, when you say, baby
Here's where it ends can't we just be friends?
And I, oh, I have to make a new start
Oh, the love and that pain, trying to wind your love back again

Got to make comeback

A world of let's pretend, dear
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear

But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow

I can't let you see
All the tears I'm crying
You would pity me --
That would be like dying

If I can't have your love
I don't need your sympathy

How much you hurting me

Whenever you're near I hide my tears

78,Leonard Cohen,One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong,TRUFOIQ128F427888F,1967,"I lit a thin green candle
To make you jealous of me
But the room just filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust from a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
Then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor
He said I'd just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

I heard of a saint who had loved you
So I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Was to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in a pool
His body is gone but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

An eskimo showed me a movie
He'd recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
O please let me come into the storm"

And I hope you're there
And you still care
And if you do,
I'll spend my life with you.

I've had all the time I need
To rearrange my mind and lead
The life I thought I wanted yesterday
I played a game that couldn't last
And now some mem'ries from the past
Have turned my thoughts around a different way.

You're still on my mind.

She can't tell you why.
Deep within her heart, you see,

There she sits, a lofty perch.
Strangest color blue.
Flying is forgotten now.
Thinks only of you.
Just you.
Oh yeah...

So, get all those blues,
Must be a thousand hues.
And be just differently used.
You just know.

You sit there mesmerized
By the depth of her eyes
That you can't categorize.
She got soul.
She got soul.
She got soul.

Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?

Soon she's going to fly away.

83,Miriam Makeba,A Piece Of Ground,TRPTTXZ128F14A550C,1967,"When the white man first came here from over the seas
He looked and he said, this is God's own country
He was mighty well pleased with this land that he'd found
And he said I will make here my own piece of ground

Now many's the battle he still had to fight
Many's the family that died in the night
For many were the black men that lived all around
And all of them wanting their own piece of ground

Then one fine day in 1883
Gold was discovered in good quantity
The country was rich, much richer than planned
And each digger wanted his own piece of land

Now the white diggers were few and the gold was so deep
That the black man was called 'cause his labor was cheap
With drill and with shovel he toiled underground
For six pennies a day to tender the ground

Now this land is so rich and it seems strange to me
That the black man whose labor has helped it to be
Cannot enjoy the fruits that abound
Is uprooted and kicked from his own piece of ground

Some people say now don't you worry
We've kept you a nice piece of reserve territory
But how can a life for so many be found
On a miserable thirty per cent of the ground?

Yet, some people say now don't you worry
You can always find jobs in the white man's city
But don't stay too long and don't stay too deep
Or you're bound to disturb the white man in his sleep

White man don't sleep long and don't sleep too deep
Or your life and your possessions, how long will you keep?
For I've heard a rumor that's running around
That the black man's demanding his own piece of ground
His own piece of ground"

Her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no.

I met a girl across the sea,
Her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find,
Follow me the wise man said,
But he walked behind.

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well,
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.

Morning came and then came noon,
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon.

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.

One morning I woke up alone,
The hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.

I ate and ate and ate,
No I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate.

I spent my hatred everyplace,
On every work on every face,
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace.

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.

I was handsome I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.

Who is it whom I address,
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said: ""Well child,
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?

Well, now, she wasn't no loser
If you will investigate
But if you're thinking to choose her
You better think when it's late

I'm beginning to feel she's not around at all

It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home

As they lay me neath the green green grass of home"

Will never be useless for he's part of God's plan
Did you ever think of life as just a shop along the street
And yourself as a product displayed in easy reach
And you laid there for some quite some time now and pondered at your fate
Then you begin to wonder if maybe you'd hit the market late
Wealth had looked you over once and seen you at your best
But somehow you didn't fit his needs so he took one of the rest
Love had read your label and you lingered in her mind
But the competition caught her eye and she left you there behind
Fame had brushed the edges or the counter where you lay
And she pondered for a moment but then she walked away
Lady Luck had even picked you up but then you heard her say
I just can't afford you so I'll have to let you lay
Then one day they marked you down put you up on sale
And you got looked over once again but all to no avail
Now stained with yellow marked with age you heard a salesman state
Boss I guess I'll throw this out it's old and out of date
The keeper of the shop came then and he seemed to understand
He smiled and looked you over and out a caring hand
Give me that I'll take it home don't throw it on the street
It's old and gray but in its way it'll help my shop complete"

Melting me into love as it touches my heart
But sheltered in the distance of your sleep
Is all that I could love in a lifetime
Don't you think we're forever 

Open your eyes
To the call of the winds

Like ""Hey pop can I go ride my Zoom?
It goes two hundred miles per hour suspended on balloons
And can I put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue
And imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?""

And all my deepest worries must be his cartoons

And still he'll stick his fingers in the fan

She's got her own videophone and she's a taking LSD
And now that we're best friends she wants to give a bit to me
And what's the matter Daddy, how come you're turning green
Can it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"""

Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey, that's quite a different subject

But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really, I'm sad
Oh, I'm sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad
Like a clown I pretend to be glad

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah, baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride I've tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness

But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you
Decided to go
Oh, I need you so
I'm hurt and I want you to know
But for others I put on a show

Oh, there's some sad things known to man
But there ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around, oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye
But in my lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
Really, I'm sad
Hurtin' so bad"

I gotta have your sweet inspiration
You know there's just ain't no telling what a satisfied woman might do

When you call me, baby, baby
It's such a sweet inspiration
The way you call me darlin', darlin', darlin'
Sets my heart to skating
And if I'm out in the rain, baby
And in a bad situation
You know I just reach back in my mind 
And then I find your sweet inspiration

Would make my dream come true

Yeah yeah yeah

Not like it hurt me before

Like a fox that prays on the rabbit
I had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and your habits

Ooooh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up, and I was in your arms
And I knew I had been captured

What's this whole world comin' to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter...
Gets captured by the game

Oh yeah, I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
But love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss, and then I knew it

And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark

But soon this dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed

Thank you
Good morning
Looking fine
It's all those old folks left here waiting
That leapt my heart into my mind

It's a sad, sad feeling
To still be around

On every sunny Sunday morning
All golden-aged and sittin' in
Comes out to putter in the sunshine
And shuffle through his deck of bein'

It's a sad, sad feeling
To still be around
And it's the same old tired park bench
Nobody's found

Soft wrinkled stories if you listen
About the lazy days back when
Your mom and dad were little babies
And he had friends still livin' then

It's a sad, sad feeling
To still be around
And it's the same old tired park bench
Nobody's found
And there was a tree put there for shading
That they cut down

The fields he loved got turned to highways
From horse to car to plane to moon
Staying well meant that he feels older
Yet none of his kids have the room

It's a sad, sad feeling
To still be around
And it's the same old tired park bench
Nobody's found
There was a tree put there for shading
That they cut down
And his old shoes
Had worn a spot there
From grass to ground"

Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere, he didn't care
He stood in a field where barley grows

His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough and mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows

He stood in a field where barley grows"
118,Leonard Cohen,Master Song,TRMVNQE128F92C49AF,1967,"I believe that you heard your master sing
When I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
That I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
Well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread?

You met him at some temple, where
They take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
Who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
And he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
Of all the kisses we put on some time before.

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
With a collar of leather and nails,
And he never once made you explain or talk
About all of the little details,
Such as who had a word and who had a rock,
And who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
And it never stops not even when your master fails.

And he took you up in his aeroplane,
Which he flew without any hands,
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
That drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
And, an ape with angel glands,
Erased the final wisps of pain
With the music of rubber bands.

And now I hear your master sing,
You kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
That your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
My body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
Your shirt is all undone.

And will you kneel beside this bed
That we polished so long ago,
Before your master chose instead
To make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
And you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
Before he made you go.

Then I think you're playing far too rough
For a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
To get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
Who is tapping his foot to a tune,
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
Let's say you came back some time too soon.

I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
Like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
And I taught him how you would long for me
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do.

I believe that you heard your master sing
While I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
Well at least that's what you said,
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread?"

Oh you held me captive in your false embrace

Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Oh-oh just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartache's camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

We used to meet in romantic places
Oh you gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel

And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed
Oh-oh just a minute ago your love was here
Oh baby all of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Yeah the way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

By showing love that wasn't there

A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged

And baby deep down in your heart I guess you know that it ain't right
Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night
Babe, I cry all the time!
And each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again

Fatina che non vidi mai,

Tu sei stata regina del regno

Che un giorno sognai.

E tu,

Mio caro vecchio albero,

Tu sei stato il castello d'un regno

E neppure lo sai.

Un regno

Con un solo soldato

Che cercava le streghe,

Voleva cacciarle a  sassate;

Un regno

Che ogni giorno viveva

Di mille e mille e mille

""c'era una volta"".

Non m'avessero detto mai

Che le fiabe son storie non vere,

Ora là io sarei."

Their eulogies about what to do
The troops with their tangled hair were proven
That they didn't care about nothing new
And if any body claim being king
Would strum guitars
And start to sing, but they were fooled
The vacuum of their fantasies
Had discover the fact
You see that chaos rules 
Everybody run and bare
Not exactly knowing where or why or who
Chasing kicks that no one gets
Kissing on her silhouettes of faded blue
Trying to blow one's smoke in air
Her favorite answer I don't care
It was useless to
And when the sun would start to fade
This ritual circus of charades would start anew 
Love don't come don't call my name again
I can't play cause I don't know how to win
Too bad to and hand in hand they stride
I got wind and rain for my future bright"

The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you
Oh the crystal chandeliers...

I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world so the stories say
But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day
Oh the crystal chandeliers...
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers"

For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change, but a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, ""You're strange, but don't change"", and I let her

In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

Down Fallen years go by,
No place in learning how to cry; I went astray;
Understanding is a virtue, hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try; So please!
Don't give up so soon.

Sorry that I hurt her I went astray;
Hurt her mind and broke her heart
But there's no stopping once you start; she went away;
Understanding is a virtue, hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try; So please!
Don't give up so soon.

I never knew you the way you are;
The Blinded bird is not sincere,
His flying's done from only fear, he's lost his star;
Understanding is a virtue, hard to come by
You can teach me how to love
If you'll only try; So please!

It used to be Lambeth's finest array 
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz 
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot 

And in this little yard, there's a little old man 
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand 
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves 
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home 

""Ah-choo, excuse me"" 

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed 
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed 
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair 
And you put it in your pocket 

""God, it's pouring down"" 

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy 
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys 
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell 
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket 

Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day 
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave 
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay 
And I was the wicked man who took her life away 
Very selfish, Oh God 

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell 
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself 
I've started digging holes my friend

He sews on them new bluejeans
And my mama, she was a drunkard, lord
Drinkin' down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

All I need is your whispered hello
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard
Your eyes are deeper than time
Say a love that won't rhyme without words

So now I've lost my way
I need help to show me things to say
Give me your love before mine fades away

I got to know that I belong to you

Into my life with the twist of a dial
The wave of her hand
The warmth of her smile
And even though I know that 
You and I 
Could never find
The kind of love we wanted together 
Alone
I find myself missing 
You and I
You and I 

It's not very often that something 
Special happens and you 
(You and I)
Happen to be that something special for me
And walking on grass
Where we were and laughed in the moonlight.
I find 
Myself 
Thinking of
You and I

Into my eye come visions of patterns
Designs the image of her 
I see
Into my mind
The smell of her hair
The sound of her voice 
We once were there.
And even though I know that 
You and I 
Could never find
The kind of love we wanted together

Measured minutes by a broken white line
Wonder if I'm really on her mind, oh.

There's nobody sittin' here but me, yeah!

Rubber tired, oh lonesome song
Tells me that I've done something wrong
Days before and then we parted
I wonder why I even started
Thinkin' I've been gone far too long.

Moving past those rocks and waves
I wonder how she spends her days
Watch the sun as we go by
Throwin' colors off the water sky
Thinkin' about the rainbows in my baby's eyes.

Movin' past those pine-cone trees
Sorry that I had to leave
High above on a twisted road
Oceans movin' down below
I wonder just how far I have to go.

I finally couldn't take it anymore.
I'm tired of telling her speed kills

She had to be herself
And no one else
Tracy had a hard day Sunday
Oh yeah.

Her parents came to town to visit
She cleaned out her medicine chest
She vacuumed the sofa and all the rest
Acting so prim and proper
Taking the money they had to offer
Smiling when they finally went away
People are paper mache
She lit her candle at both ends
And started flipping out on Monday
There's not another boy in town
That she can go on through
There's not another kick that's new
Mirror, mirror on the wall
she's has a very long way to fall
I tried to help her but she wouldn't listen

When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world, where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hands
One happy morning, people will share
A world where people care

Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
Where all men are equal and no man has fears
One shiney moment while on our way
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas, men will not care
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me

But there's someone that's got what makes you stay for it
In short, she offers you her heart, don't play with it

You've got to try a little bit
You might even have to cry a little bit
When you find someone for you

I know the way it gets to be a game to be your only self
And still be close to the one you love who didn't need your help
And all that time it takes to test a lifetime out
Is spent in an environment instead of finding out

You've got to try a little bit
You might even have to cry a little bit
When you find someone for you

Try a little bit
You might even have to cry a little bit
So go on and try a little bit
It doesn't matter if you have to cry a little bit

Makes you want to get a club and clout'em

Hiding under the quilting bed
The chiggers running wild in the blackberry bush
Yellow jackets swarmin' round your head

Black ants marching in a long line
They're lurking in the leaves of the strawberry patch
And climbing up the tomato vine (She gonna tell you about)

Where in this world will I escape from you?
So I won't be chained to a memory

Your pictures out the window
All that I could find that reminded me of you
I threw them all away

I'll just stand here and watch
The sky fall while you
Put yourself together
While you gather up the time it took to
Make us think we would last forever.

And war must surely come,
The cities they are broke in half
And the middle men are gone.
But let me ask you one more time
O children of the dust,
These hunters who are shrieking now
Do they speak for us?

And where do all these highways go
Now that we are free?
Why are the armies marching still
That were coming home to me?
O lady with your legs so fine
O stranger at your wheel
You are locked into your suffering
And your pleasures are the seal

The age of lust is giving birth
But both the parents ask
The nurse to tell them fairy tales
On both sides of the glass
Now the infant with his cord
Is hauled in like a kite
And one eye filled with blueprints
One eye filled with night

O come with me my little one
And we will find that farm
And grow us grass and apples there
To keep all the animals warm
And if by chance I wake at night
And I ask you who I am
O take me to the slaughter house
I will wait there with the lamb

With one hand on a hexagram
And one hand on a girl
I balance on a wishing well
That all men call the world
We are so small between the stars
So large against the sky
And lost among the subway crowds
I try to catch your eye"

Beardless Harry, what a waste
Couldn't even get a small-town taste
Rode the trolleys down to forty-seven
Figured he was good to get himself to Heaven

'Cause he had to run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy Death and you
Tell you whatcha do"
201,Burt Bacharach,The Look Of Love,TRIMIOW128F4241595,1967,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile
Can't disguise
The look of love
It's saying so much more than
just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got that look of love
It's on your face
The look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so"
202,Tony Bennett,Keep Smiling At Trouble (Trouble's A Bubble),TRWMBXV128F92FB17B,1967,"When you’ve learned that life
Is what you make it
Then you know the secret of it all

Find your share of happiness
And take it
Make life a song
As you go along

Keep smiling at trouble
For trouble’s a bubble
And bubbles will soon go away

With never a sadness
And nothing but gladness
We’d weary of life in a day

Be like the violets that doze ‘neath the chilled winter snows
They bravely wait for the May

So keep smiling at trouble
For trouble’s a bubble
And bubbles will soon go away

(scatting)

So keep smiling at trouble
For trouble’s a bubble
And bubbles will soon go away

And bubbles will soon go away"

I seem to wander endlessly 
with a hope burning out deep inside 
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out 
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt 
I'm alone and there is no one by my side 

In the blackness of the night 
I see a shadow passing by 
from the heels of an old soldier boy. 
There's no compromising 
and his eyes are black as the sky 
For this bad, bad world he is going to die. 
He's alone and there is no one by his side 

In the blackness of the night 
I see a sparkle of a star 
from the sweet silver tear of a child 
and she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago 
When her parents were happy she was too young to know 
she's alone and there is no one by her side 

I'm alone and there is no one by my side 

In the blackness of the night

with a hope burning out deep inside

That nobody else could see
Or had looked quite deep enough to find
You passed over all my faults
And still came through it all
When no-one else would have taken the time
And without as much as a word or a touch
You had me wanting you

Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
I love you like I do
Is it any wonder

In a world of fakery
Your touch of sincerity
I have come to depend upon
Seems you know just what to say
When the mood I'm in is gray
And your smile works like a magic wand
And on top of this, how could anyone resist
Wanting to be a part of you"

You told me you'd never stray, you told me!
All these things you said you said sincerely.
Still I am leaving you in spite of what you told me.

I've heard things that did not match what you told me.
And of your love that would not last as you told me.
Forwarned is forearmed, it hurts, I'm leaving.
I may be wrong I can't love what I'm just hearing.

Times have made me shy
Of all the things you're saying
Time have made me shy 
Of girls and all the games they are playing.

Someday I may see the truth of what you told me.
I may find I left too soon and that you told me.
Only things that you were honestly feeling.
I must have more to love than what you told me.

Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me.
Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me."

A sua dor
A nossa vida
Já não cabem na batida
Do meu pobre cavaquinho

Ai, quem me dera
Pelo menos um momento
Juntar todo sofrimento
Pra botar nesse chorinho
Ai, quem me dera ter um choro de alto porte
Pra cantar com a voz bem forte
E anunciar a luz do dia
Mas quem sou eu
Pra cantar alto assim na praça
Se vem dia, dia passa
E a praça fica mais vazia

Vem, morena
Não me despreza mais, não
Meu choro é coisa pequena
Mas roubado a duras penas
Do coração

Meu chorinho
Não é uma solução
Enquanto eu cantar sozinho
Quem cruzar o meu caminho
Não pára não

Mas eu me insisto
Quem quiser que me compreenda
Até que alguma luz acenda
Se meu canto continua
Junto ao meu canto
A cada pranto
A cada choro
Até que alguém me faça coro
Pra cantar na rua

Junto ao meu canto
A cada pranto
A cada choro
Até que alguém me faça coro
Pra cantar na rua

Junto ao meu canto
A cada pranto
A cada choro
Até que alguém me faça coro
Pra cantar na rua . . ."

What a crazy crazy party, never seen so many people
Laughing, dancing, look at you you're having fun
But look at me I'm almost cryin'
That don't keep her love from dyin'
Misery, 'cause for me the party's over

Turn out the lights, the party's over

Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

Once I had a love undyin'
I didn't keep it but I tried
Life for me was just one party and then another
I broke her heart so many times
Had to have my parting wine
But one day she said, ""Sweetheart, the party's over""

Is there no escape
He will show you lines that time has etched into your face
And all around the edges
Life is turning gray
And you can no longer turn your head the other way
And the new hard times are here
And the new hard times are here

When eating comes too easy
Nothing makes you think
There's too much time to sun yourself 
And too much wine to drink
And now there's nothing left to help maintain your failing pride
You hunger for the older days when rich men satisfied
And the new hard times are here
And the new hard times are here

In the twilight years life takes a bend
And you start to view it from the other end
You laughed a lot and had your fun
Now you find there's so much left undone
And ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In your lifetime that's the only rule you've come to trust
And waiting 'round the corner
To put his arms around you
Death comes a'courting and you don't know what to do

Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 

This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 

This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 

This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 

And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 

This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs"
222,Phil Ochs,The Crucifixion,TRSEBWX128F1463D2B,1967,"And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
'Til the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
Planets are paralyzed; the mountains are amazed
But they all glow brighter from the brilliance of the blaze
With the speed of insanity, then he dies.

In the green fields a-turning, a baby is born
His cries crease the wind and mingle with the morn
An assault upon the order, the changing of the guard
Chosen for a challenge that is hopelessly hard
And the only single sighing is the sighing of the stars
But to the silence of distance they are sworn

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Images of innocence charge him to go on
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
A blinding revelation is served upon his plate
That beneath the greatest love there is a hurricane of hate
And God help the critic of the dawn.

So he stands on the sea and he shouts to the shore,
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs;
The merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
'Til the giant is aware that someone's pulling at his leg,
And someone is tapping at the door.

To dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads accross the land
The rewarding of the fame is the falling of the man
For ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
And blood is the language of the band.

The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
The excitement is estatic, passion places bets
Gracefully he bows to the ovations that he gets
But the hands that are applauding him are slippery with sweat
And saliva is falling from their smiles

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then this overflow of life is crushed into a lyre
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
It's the death of beauty, the victory of night
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
All the heavens are horrified, they stagger at the sight
And the cross is trembling with desire.

They say they can't believe it, it's a sacreligious shame
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
How did it happen?  I hope his suffering was small.
Tell me every detail, I've got to know it all,
And do you have a picture of the pain?

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Time takes a toll and the memory fades
but his glory is growing in the magic that he made.
Reality is ruined; there's nothing more to fear
The drama is distorted into what they want to hear
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
As they wait for the new thrill parade.

The eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
To the safety of sterility the threat has been refined
The child was created; to the slaughterhouse he's led
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
As the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
'Til the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
But they all glow brighter from the briliance of the blaze
With the speed of insanity, then he dies."

And send it soaring high above you

I will scatter rice paper stars in your heaven
If there are no stars, if there are no stars
All of these and seven wonders more will I find

And every time I see you with that smile upon your face
There's a little bit there for me

And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers, ""Mary""

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere, a queen is weeping
Somewhere, a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries, ""Mary""

The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And the wind screams, ""Mary""

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, ""No, this will be the last""

And the wind cries, ""Mary"""

On the day it rained
When I tore it open
There in my hands
Only ash remained

As I fell asleep

Light up someone's home 'cause

One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh please Mr Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me

Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause

So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see you on Christmas Day"

As I feel the embers die
No longer can I walk these paths
For they have changes
I must be home.  The sun is gone
And I think it's gonna rain

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again

I remember children
Feeding flocks of pigeons
I remember sunshine
And you were mine

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again

Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same
Sunday will never be the same"
253,The Young Rascals,Groovin'  (Single Version),TRFQZFS128F1473A5E,1967,"Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't a place I'd like to be instead of

Movin' down a crowded avenue
Doin' anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can be anyone we like to be
All those happy people we could meet

Just groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no

(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
No, no, no, no
Groovin', uh huh
Groovin'"
254,Sandie Shaw,Think Sometimes About Me (2004 Digital Remaster),TRXFKLU128F9301C4F,1967,"When I come home, and thereÆs no one around My thoughts go back to you I hear your voice roll in like a sound So I try not to think I just do Do you also think sometime about me? Oh do you think sometime about me? Say you do Oh please, please do Sometime your sound for no reason at all Reminds me how it was Times we have had on the path to recall Time weÆve had and I lost Do you also think sometime about me? Oh do you think sometime about me? Say you do Oh please, please do"
255,Dolly Parton,Fuel To The Flame,TRFUTQC12903CED800,1967,"You kindle the fire of love inside me 
Each time our lips meet 
I'm not strong when we're alone 
Your kisses make me weak 
You must know how I feel 
But do you feel the same 
Everytime you kiss me 
You add fuel to the flame 

My eyes light up when I see you 
I burn with desire 
Each time you're near 
You say you'll care 
But still I'm not sure 

But please don't ask me to love you 
If you're not gonna change my name 

Everytime you touch me 
You add fuel to the flame 
This fire you started inside me 
Has reached my very soul 
You're adding fuel to a flame 
That's already burning out of control 
When you give me your name 
I give you everything 
Everytime you kiss me 
Adds fuel to the flame 
Yes everytime you touch me 
You add fuel to the flame"
256,Laura Nyro,Stoney End,TRTADGC128F426A068,1967,"I was born from love, and my poor mother worked the mines
I was raised on the good book Jesus till I read between the lines
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)

I can still remember him with love light in his eyes
But the light flickered out and parted as the sun began to rise
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again
(Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again)

Never mind the forecast, 'cause the sky has lost control
'Cause the fury and the broken thunder's come to match my raging soul 
Now I don't believe I want to see the morning

Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me
Going down the stoney end
I never wanted to go down the stoney end
Mama, let me start all over
Cradle me, Mama, cradle me again"
257,The Stone Poneys,I've Got To Know,TRYHRAU128F1457E7D,1967,"I'd like to know, baby
How you feel about me
I'd like to know, baby
How you feel about me
I've got to know if you think you might leave me
Baby won't you break it to me 
If you're planning to deceive me
Woah-oh to deceive me
I'd like to hear
What you say when you talk about me
Do your friends know something I don't
Or just appears to be
Everyone says on the surface things look fine
Am I still the only one for you 
And is it true are you really mine
Woah-oh really mine
If you go away I won't know what to do or what to say
Baby I can't make it without you beside me every day
Baby tell me baby show that this is not a fake
Just try and show me that there's no mistake
In staying with you
Woah-oh, with you

I'd like to know, baby
How you feel about me
I'd like to know, baby
How you feel about me
I've got to know if you think you might leave me
Baby won't you break it to me 
If you're planning to deceive me
Woah-oh to deceive me

I'd like to know I'd like to know I'd like to know...."
258,Sonny & Cher,Plastic Man (LP Version),TRIKAFZ128F423255A,1967,"He's out there tripping in the streets
The sidewalk floats beneath his feet
He's shaking ever body's hand
But he's not disclosing that he's

He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man

He's on the t.v. selling cars
He interrupts old movie stars
And he can sell like any plan
But he's not disclosing that he's

He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man

This man is working day and night
He's hip to psychedelic light
He even does the puk-a-lu
But he's not disclosing
He's recruiting you

He's chasing every body
Displacing every body
He's doing every one he can
Plastic man"
259,Gordon Lightfoot,Walls,TRXWHNA128F42870C2,1967,"I'm not ashamed
To say that I've loved you well
I'm not ashamed
To let you know
I'm just a name that's all
Scratched upon your wall
You've used it well but what the hell
That's what walls are for 
I'm not ashamed
To listen to the fast-fallin' rain
In the morning upon my window
I'm not afraid to cry
I'm not ashamed to try
To be your friend once again
'Cause that's what's friends are for 

Friends are for sorting out the hang-ups that we hide 
Walls are for shutting out the love we feel inside 

I'm not ashamed no to talk it over once again 
To rearrange my vocabulary
But I can't seem to find 
Any words to change your mind 
Because I left them all behind
And that's what words are for 

Words are for explaining the mistakes we might have made
Names are for calling when there's nothing left to say 

I'm not ashamed, no, to say that I've loved you well 
I'm not ashamed, and yet I know
I'm just a name, that's all
Scratched upon your wall
You've used it well, but what the hell
That's what walls are for 

I'm not ashamed of wearing out my old grey socks 
Chasing you around the back woods
I'm not ashamed to darn
Nor to proud to find some yarn
To sew them up once again
'Cause that's what socks are for"
260,Luigi Tenco,Angela,TRQXEYJ128F429FA5F,1967,"Angela, Angela, angelo mio
Io non credevo che questa sera
Sarebbe stato davvero un addio,
Angela credimi, io non volevo.

Angela, Angela, angelo mio
Quando t'ho detto che voglio andarmene,
Volevo solo vederti piangere,
Perché mi piace farti soffrire.

Angela, Angela, angelo mio
Ma tu stasera invece di piangere
Guardi il mio viso in un modo strano
Come se fosse ormai lontano.

Ti prego, Angela, no, non andartene
Non puoi lasciarmi quaggiù da solo
Non è possibile che tutto a un tratto
Io possa perderti, perdere tutto.

Volevo farti piangere
Vedere le tue lacrime
Sentire che il tuo cuore
È nelle mie mani."

O Cordão da Liberdade 
E o Bloco da Mocidade 
Vão sair no carnaval 
É preciso ir à rua 
Esperar pela passagem 
É preciso ter coragem 
E aplaudir o pessoal 

O Rancho do Novo Dia 
Vem com mais de mil pastoras 
Todas elas detentoras 
De um sorriso sem igual 
O Cordão da Liberdade 
Ensaiado com carinho 
Pelo Zé Redemoinho 
Pelo Chico Vendaval 

Oh, que linda fantasia 
Do Bloco da Mocidade 
Colorida de ousadia 
Costurada de amizade 
Vai ser lindo ver o bloco 
Desfilar pela cidade

Nossa turma vai sair 
Nossa escola vai sambar 
Vai cantar pra gente ouvir 
Tá na hora, vamos lá 
Carnaval é pra valer 
Nossa turma é da verdade 
E a verdade vai vencer"

No, no I ain't going down, that road of love by myself
Now if you won't go with me baby
I guess I'll just have to get somebody else

Oh darling, I hope you feel the same way too
Baby, I sure hope you feel the same way too
Cause as long as we have each other
I'll have your love to see me through now
And ohh baby, let's walk together hand in hand
Ohh baby, baby, baby, let's walk together hand in hand, oh lord
And you can be my little woman now

Take care of me baby, ohh baby"

You better leave, Lord, you better leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and I'm known to do something wrong

You called my house, no later than yesterday
'Cause I picked up the extension, and I heard every word you said
Now, why don't you just go on, man, and leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and I'm known to do something wrong
You better leave her alone, now

You call my house, all the hours of the night
But, let me tell you, mister, that's a sure way to start a fight
Now, why don't you just go on, man, and leave my little girl alone
Cause, Lord, you know I can get so evil, and I'm known to do something wrong"
264,Dusty Springfield,The Look Of Love,TRKNFML128F426FA4D,1967,"The look of love 
Is in your eyes
The look your smile can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so"

But it won't be easy
Stone walls surround me

And you don't stand an outside chance
(you don't stand an outside chance)
You don't stand an outside chance
But you can try

Whatever you do girl
You know you can't get through girl
Can't bring me down
Hang me up or even hang around

And you don't stand an outside chance
(you don't stand an outside chance)
You don't stand an outside chance
But you can try

I know you think you'll get me
I'm only flesh and bone
But you may as well forget me
'Cause my heart is stone
You better leave me alone

You can try to please me
But it won't be easy

Stand an outside chance"
266,The Marvelettes,My Baby Must Be A Magician,TRTZPWA128F93227E9,1967,"You are under my power
It is the power of love

Eyes that hypnotize
And all it takes is just once glance
Just one look at him
Puts me in a lover's trance

Now listen, no rabbits in his hand
No pigeons up his sleeve
But you better believe
When I prove he can do so much

My baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch

Oh, my morale was low
Then he appeared just like a genie
His love has the power
He's my private great Houdini

No reading decks of cards
No cords that disappear
No special gear
Like Alladin's lamp and such

But my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch

Whenever I'm feeling bad
My baby simply kisses me
And then Presto, Chango, Alakazam
I'm alright again, oh, yes I am, yes I am alright

No mystic crystal ball
No long black flowing cape
But I can't escape
From his tender loving touch

Oh my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch
Say my baby must be a magician
'Cause he's sure got the magic touch"
