0,John Gorka,Carnival Knowledge (second hand face),TRCTYOJ128F428B5BF,1994,"I've never done it said the circus clown
See this is really my nose
I ran away back in junior high
Got this job and these clothes

You know I started out an altar boy
So that retarded me some
I've been saving up and down for years
To have the surgery done

I had a chance once with the popcorn girl
Until her father stopped that
He said he'd give me holes I didn't need
With a certain knifethrowing act
I'll roll my quarters and I'll roll my dimes
Till I am out of this place
You may know someone who would want my job
And a second hand face

I know a doctor who can do the job
Back in our winter town
It's slow to save what on this salary
And so much competition around

It got so bad I just didn't try no more
A heatless low head of esteem
I have to settle for the paper views
And the occasional dream

The smile I've got is one that's painted on
I could paint one on you
I just can't sell myself to pay for love
Like the other clowns do
I'll roll my quarters and I'll roll my dimes
Till I am out of this place
You may know someone who would want my job
And a second hand face
And a second hand face
And a second hand face"
1,Newsboys,Shine,TRLEYZK128F931F83D,1994,"Dull as dirt
You can't assert the kind of light
That might persuade
A strict dictator to retire
Fire the army
Teach the poor origami
The truth is in
The proof is when
You hear your heart
Start asking, ""What's my motivation?""

And try as you may, there isn't a way
To explain the kind of change
That would make an Eskimo renounce fur
That would make a vegetarian barbecue hamster
Unless you can trace this about-face
To a certain sign...

Shine
Make 'em wonder what  you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored
Shine
Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

Out of the shaker and onto
The plate
It isn't Karma
It sure ain't fate
That would make a Deadhead sell his van
That would make a schizophrenic turn in his crayons
Oprah freaks
And science seeks a rationale
That shall excuse
This strange behavior

When you let it shine
You will inspire
The kind of entire turnaround
That would make a bouncer take ballet
(Even bouncers who aren't...happy)
But out of the glare
With nowhere to turn
You ain't gonna learn it on
""What's My Line?""

Shine
Make 'em wonder what  you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored
Shine
Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

Shine….

Shine
Make 'em wonder what  you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored
Shine
Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

Shine
Make 'em wonder what  you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored

Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

Make 'em wonder what  you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside looking bored

Let it shine before all men
Let 'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

2,Jimmy LaFave,I've Got Your Picture,TRIPUQR128F935234D,1994,"Well, I’ve got your picture
It’s beside my bed
Girl, I think about you all the time
When you said you were leaving
I said you’re out of your head
Now I know I was out of my mind

Girl, don’t you know
I did you wrong
You tried to reach me
I was out on the streets
All alone
Never realizing
What I was throwing away
Tell me what can I say
Make it like it was before
I beg you, darling, please
Don’t you hurt me anymore

I know that love
It’s just a game
A game we all play
All the time
I’d beg, steal, and borrow
Do anything
If I could just get you
Off of my mind

Girl, don’t you know
I did you wrong
You tried to reach me
I was out on the streets
All alone
Never realizing
What I was throwing away
Tell me what can I say
Make it like it was before
I beg you, darling, please
Don’t you hurt me anymore

4,2 Minutos,Vos No Confiaste,TRUOQTR128F9322DBC,1994,"Vos no confiaste
y te fuiste del pais
a buscar un futuro
inmediato y mucho mejor. 
Hace un año y medio ya
que estas viviendo en Madrid
lavando copas en un bar
tratando de sobrevivir. 
En el cuartito del hotel
cuelgan de la pared
tu diploma de arquitecto
y el banderin de River Plate. 
Vos no te diste cuenta
que sos sapo de otro pozo
otro roñzo sudaca
en la vieja Europa. 
Vos no confiaste
en la gente de tu pais. 
Vos no esperaste a tu pais
vos no confiaste! 
vos no esperaste!"
5,Hi-Five,She Said,TRUDJIN128F4266084,1994,"(I didn't know life, could be so cold
My baby's gone away and left me with a broken heart
I'm falling apart.
Not a kiss goodbye, but still I remember 

Chours
She said I will be with you forever
She said I'm in love with you 
She said no baby don't forget
That no ones gonna love you more than I do

I care for you.  I'm crazy.  Allday long I just think of you
Think of your love baby all I need.
I'll do whatever it takes Just please forgive me.

Chours
Repeat"
6,Tom Petty,Wake Up Time (Album Version),TRTMHSM128F931B51B,1994,"You follow your feelings
You follow your dreams
You follow the leader
Into the trees

And what's in there waiting
Neither one of us knows
You gotta keep one eye open
The further you go

You never dreamed you'd go down on one knee, but now
Who could've seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?

You feel like a poor boy
A long way from home
You're just a poor boy 
A long way from home

And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine

You spend your life dreaming 
Running round in a trance
You hang out forever
And still miss the dance

And if you get lucky 
You might find someone
To help you get over
The pain that will come

Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened?
You were so sure not to have your spirits down

But you're just a poor boy
Alone in this world
You're just a poor boy
Alone in this world

And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine

Well, they think it's lucky
A boy finds a girl
To help him to shoulder
The pain in this world

And if you follow your feelings
You follow your dreams
You might find the forest
There in the trees

Yeah, you'll be all right, it's just gonna take time, and now
Who could have seen you'd be so hard to please somehow?

You're just a poor boy 
A long way from home
You're just a poor boy
A long way from home

And it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine

'Cause it's wake-up time
Time to open up your eyes
And rise
And shine"
7,Jovanotti,Si Va Via,TRKMNLC128F148C438,1994,"Sono un deejay che lavora in diversi locali
Frequentati da ragazzi più o meno normali
Magari che lavorano durante la settimana
O che abitano magari in qualche zona lontana
Da questa discoteca che al sabato sera
È l'unico locale dove c'è un'atmosfera un po' giusta
Arriva un po' di gente
Potrebbe trasformarsi in una storia divertente

Allora via si va, via si va, si va via
Qualcuno c'ha la macchina qualcuno l'energia
Intesa in tanti modi, quello dipende
Ognuno può affrontare la notte che scende
Nel modo che gli pare gli piace e gli pare
Allora è un altro sabato che sta per cominciare
Però però però non c'è niente da dire
La voglia di far festa e quella di fuggire
Da quando il mondo è mondo si possono incontrare
E c'è qualcuno che sceglie di andare a ballare da me
Che metto su la musica più forte che c'è
E allora c'è qualcuno che per venire da me
Si fa cento chilometri e io che posso fare
Quando li vedo qui li faccio ballare
Li prendo e me li porto dietro fino al sole
E tutto il resto sono parole

Sono un deejay vedo molto io dall'alto di questi piatti
Ne ho viste io di cose io ne ho visti di fatti
Ho visto una signora ingioiellata far la figa
Ho visto un entra ed esci per pipparsi qualche riga
Che finisce dentro al naso di un figlio di papà
Che si nasconde dentro all'università
Ho visto uomini baciarsi tra di loro con affetto
E coppie miste che non vanno più d'accordo neanche a letto
Ho visto dei politici arrivare con la scorta
Li ho visti strafottenti mentre fan la mano morta
Alla bionda con la minigonna con un sogno nel cassetto
Ed ho saputo di quel sogno addormentarsi dentro al letto
Ma più di ogni altra cosa ho visto gente regolare
Che veniva qui a ballare, a rimorchiare
Vivendo questo tempo in modo attivo ma anche onesto
Ognuno nel suo mondo e son parole tutto il resto
Parole che però mi piacerebbe raccontare
In questo sabato che sta per cominciare

E allora via si va, via si va, si va via
In culo a questa notte e pure alla polizia
La strada la conosco e questa macchina di papà
Stasera che ho bevuto sembra che vada la metà

E io che da dieci anni torno a casa a quest'ora
All'ora che di solito la gente poi lavora
Girando le statali dalla uno alla mille
Ho visto tante macchine poi far le scintille
Con la carrozzeria che poi grattava il catrame
Ho visto le lamiere diventare come lame
Sull'asfalto ho visto macchine come lattine d'aranciata
Accartocciarsi intorno a un albero dopo una sbandata
E allora non c'è sabato che in una provinciale
Senza lo stronzo che mi sorpassa male
In curva sulla destra mi passa a centottanta
Diretto verso il buio di questi anni novanta

E io sono un deejay e il lunedì c'ho la nausea
Non posso poi non chiedermi qual è la causa
Ma poi me ne dimentico e in fondo son sincero
A quello del sorpasso io dedico un pensiero
Pensiero di fratello pensiero un po' tetro
È brutto quando sbagli non poter tornare indietro

E allora via si va, via si va, si va via
In culo a questa notte e pure alla polizia

Ripenso a tutti i miti della gioventù bruciata
Al mito dell'eccesso alla vita spericolata
Fanculo alla ferrari e pure al maggiolino
Non valgono il sacrificio neanche di un moscerino
Spiaccicato sopra al vetro di un sabato da pazzi
Niente giudizi però per quei ragazzi
Sono figli di questo tempo che non ha tempo per le morali
Sono ragazzi, ragazzi ""normali""
Figli di questo tempo un po' malato nei contenuti
Che questo rap sia un monumento ai caduti
Di una guerra che fa vittime di diciotto anni
Sacrificate al dio dei grandi inganni

E allora via si va, via si va, si va via
In culo a questa notte e pure alla polizia
La strada la conosco e questa macchina di papà
Stasera che ho bevuto sembra che vada la metà

Comunque tutto ciò non fa parte del mio lavoro
Tutto questo va molto oltre ogni stupido coro
Di questi moralizzatori che san sempre ciò che è giusto
E che in fondo al lunedì mattina ci provan gusto
Tutto questo con gli orari di chiusura dei locali
Con la musica e il volume con la birra e con gli amari
C'entra poco, lo dico perché ho sempre fatto tardi
E chi ha in mano la risposta sono dei bugiardi
Io non ho risposta alcuna ho soltanto la mia rabbia
Nel vedere molta gente come me dentro una gabbia
Nel vedere che la libertà diventa paradosso
E la trovi la mattina spiaccicata dentro a un fosso..."
8,Penal Colony,Reconciled,TRTNZPI128F92E7F99,1994,"Paranoia in sedate
No longer threatens
See the ordinance fall
See the upright crawl to be mentioned

Sin is no longer the den
Neatly at the back of the queue
""Why?"" is not the question
But the absurdity, the absurdity

""What do you do?""
Fall asleep interrogating.
""What do you do?""
Join the old and hated.
What do you do
When time bears no covet? No covet.
What do you do
When you're reconciled? Reconciled.

Complacency burrows down
Like the earwigs that have been waiting
Fulfilling every prophecy
Swore that I would never be
Something is killing it
Without my even knowing it
Let the baggage go, shed the worried soul
And I'm ready for nothing

""What do you do?""
When dysfunction is castrated.
""What do you do?""
When there's order and content.
What do you do
When they've found you out? Found you out.
What do you do
When you're reconciled? Reconciled."
9,Crosby_ Stills & Nash,Only Waiting For You  (LP Version),TRYVINZ128F423822F,1994,"I cannot remember feeling quite so self assured
It must have been back in my teens
I was such a basket case when I was young
It's obviously something that I dreamed

I have always been a most reclusive kind of guy
When love's around I usually run and hide
Don't you go believin' I was ever that confused
I was really only waiting for you

Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you

And I cannot escape the over-whelming feeling
Destiny has taken us in hand
And nothing that we do is gonna change
The way this love affair is never gonna end

And I know it's hard getting used to the idea
That your lover wants to be your best friend
With a showing of affection and a measure of romance
This is really only waiting for you

Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you

Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you
Waiting, waiting, only waiting for you

I've been living by myself I do not want for someone else
At least that's what I like to say
And it was working till the other day I met you
And I fell in love from twenty yards away

I've got one last truly great love left in my life
And my heart is tellin' me it might be you
So forget your disappointments I'll forget about my past
I was really only waiting for you

Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever
Really only waiting for you

Really only waiting for you
And what do you suppose that we can do
Anything whatever that you want to last forever"

Feeling contemplative today.

In what I bought or what I thought but
That's not going to be satisfactory today. 

CHORUS 

Used to run and try to hide,
Today I'll stay and pick a side
And if I die well least I tried,
Yer standin' in my way... 

Looked around this place to see where I belong.
Feel misunderstood again today.
It's such a strange sensation
Being my kind here in this time yeah.
But that's not cause for much    But aggravation today. 

CHORUS 

Where was I - when Jimi kissed the sky?
And a Beatle said it's not too late to ""Give peace a chance.""
I survived The Brady Bunch, And the age of ""let's do lunch""

While you snored and drooled
I fucked your love
She called me Daddy
And I called her baby 
When I smacked her ass
I called her sugar when 
I ate her alive till daylight
And I slept with her all over me
From forehead to ribcage 
I dripper her ass
Sometimes I thought 
You might be spying
Living out some brash fantasy
But no, you were knocked out
But we were all knocked out you know
In a way I serve too many masters

We didn't know you'd break the bottle 
That the magic came in to use those 
Jagged shards to slit our wrists and neck

And you'd do it too
You're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what 
You were doing because I didn't
Your girlfriend could
Have been a burn victim
An amputee, a dead body
But god damn I wanted to fuck

I'm losing what's left of my mind
I'm serving too many fucking masters
I told you. I told you motherfucker"

We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling,

Take my hand and be my wife.

There's no time for wasting, baby,

16,The Wannadies,Dying For More,TRGYXJO128F428C948,1994,"I've been flying airplanes
Doesn't seem to thrill me,
To excite me anymore

I've met sweet girls and boys
Played around with love toys
Nothing turns me on no more

I've been to San Francisco
San Luis Obispo
I've been surfing, my first love

I've been chasing, wasting
Shortcuts to sensation
Spent a million days astray

I want something new, give me anything 


I'm dying, I'm dying for more
I want something new, give me anything 
I'm dying, I'm dying for more

I've been driving shiny sportscars
Doesn't seem to thrill me,
To excite me anymore

I've been sailing oceans
I've seen a thousand coastlines
Now there's nothing new to find

I want something new, give me anything 
I'm dying, I'm dying for more
I want something new, give me anything 
I'm dying, I'm dying for more"

A temporary spell in hell and it throbs
It throbs like hell in some divine comedy
It won't sell and that's a tragedy
But I know my way home I can get there alone
The day I need you they can feed me to the lions
They can stop trying to get it started
Its heart is gone, its shone for the last time
It's past time it's mean time held over in-between time
It's like Halloween time


I don't owe you anything
Now I'm out of power
Now I've lost my touch
Please don't touch anything
Every passing hour 
Overcomes too much
I don't owe you anything


There's a weaker weaker in the other speaker
A weaker echo of my own voice
Reproduced mechanically and electronically
A symphony of frequencies delivering
A slithering sound a pound of flesh
Caught in the mesh of pressure
A special deluxe de-essed it you guessed it
I'm trembling (Untrammeled ?)


I don't owe you anything
Now I've lost my power
Now I'm out of touch
Please don't touch anything
Every passing hour
Overcomes too much
I don't owe you anything
Now I've lost my mind
Now I'm out of touch


Should you would you could you could
Could you look good back on the street
Your feet get cold you're too old you've been told
You should've sold your soul
It's not worth anything anything out here
Not worth the earth you're standing on
Earth mother earth hurt sweet mother earth
What are you worth?


I don't owe you anything
Now I'm out of power
Now I've lost my touch
Please don't touch anything
Every passing hour
All becomes too much

Everything is complete

If you want to eat
Even the air, once free
You now pay a fee
You now pay a far if you want air

Fair enough, it's tough stuff
It's tough to get enough and you laugh
You laugh but you can't get the staff

Unbroken silence - a total misfortune and shame

agression from view
This tearing suture renounces the love he once knew

Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero - distrusted and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

It's just not my day

Well she's the girl who plays
The holiday is over, the honeymoon is over
The garden's overgrown
The trust is rusted, the link's been busted
The seeds are sown
The sounds of my breath, what do you expect
Echo in the hall
The ghost of the picture still haunts the master
Bedroom mirror wall

I suppose you'd say she made a fool of me
Oh, but she has authority

It used to be fine
Days full of music, nights full of music
Music all the time
Invisible light
I try my best but I transgressed
It used to be fine
The chances are used up, the finances used up
The energy is low
Letters are returned, lovers are spurned
Deliver quite a blow
The signs of disaster, I wouldn't put it past her
The dagger's in the dark
The stale perfume in her old room
Heart of a shark

I suppose you'd say she made a slave of me
Oh, but she has authority

I guess that that's all
The curtain comes down and the circus leaves town
The leaves begin to fall
I guess that that's it
The world keeps spinning, people keep sinning
And all the rest is just bullshit
The shadow's getting longer, the widow's gettin' younger
The cup doth overflow
The luxury of pity, babe this wasn't pretty
On with the show
Life is a tangle, a one night triangle
Some tangle of life limbs (??)
You sleep like a baby precious as a ruby
Goodbye everything

The poets they still had to muse
Over the classicism of clean shoes
But who today still knows a button stick
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times
That's the new times
The girls would lie down before us
First one went dancing, then behind the bushes
Today you have to run through twenty places
Get drunk on saccharin and methyl
And then you still don't get them that far
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times
That's the new times
Now take it easy there in the early morning
Who arrives but the brethren from the press
If somewhere there lies a cadaver
Or something is foul in the state
You can be sure that a writer is not far behind
With his Excellency I only say:
Hands off the literature
The laurel wreath one gets today
Second hand so to speak
&gt;From the old Empire's stories
Sold underhand at the Alexanderplatz
With all the wigs and costumes
Twitching from the shoulder one is informed

And take me through your soul
I'll give you my love...
I'll give you my love...
Late in the night
When I'm lying alone in the dark without you
Tears in my eyes
And I'm crying a river that leads right to your door
I'll give you my love...
I'll give you my love...

Living my life
It's so hard to go on when you're not with me
Feeling a fight
How I struggle inside and I feel my heart explode

You drained me of trust and you left me alone

And you played, on my fears
And I feigned to be blind
And I guess I'm the fool
For not drawin' some line

So spare me the clichés,
How things will be better
Don't you dare claim that you understand me

'Cause these words that you offer
Under cover of kindness
Are selfish not selfless,
And that's plain to see

I thought you would change
That you'd settle down
Just how much did you think
I would swallow
To keep you around
To keep you around

And you played on my fears
And I feigned to be blind
And I guess I'm the fool
For not drawing some line

Well right now I am calm,
The rage will come later
I'll deal with this in my own time,
My own way

But right now pack your bags
Can walk out the door
When time's done its healing,
I'll hear what you say

Das Futter unserer Eitelkeit
Nackt verkohlt
Der heilige Pflug
Bröckeln eurer hölzern Türme
Stein um Stein

In blutigen Schlachten
Spenden Kinder trost
An allen Mauern stehen
Die Erschossenen wieder auf
Kann es Seelen geben
Die am Grauen sich erfreuen
Wenn aus greisen Händen
Giftige Samen fallen

Das Blut der Schwachen
Den Siegern eingeimpft
Von Lumpen aufgewischt
Es rostig schmeckt
Mütter stürzen suchend
Gräber ihrer Kinder
Gesichter verstümmelt
Von Krähen hinterlassen

Kriege werden nie
Gewalt vernichten
Und Erlichkeit von Kot und Stroh
Wie faulend gelbe Maden
Es stirbt ein Kind
Unter Marmorsäulen
Auf diesem Boden sollen
Hellerleuchtet neue Städte stehn

Schuld, Recht
Kein guter Wille hilft uns mehr
Uns retten nur noch Wunder

Volk, Sucht
Unsere Mutter Erde hängt
Am letzten zuckend Nerv

Unerbittlich sträubt sich meine Seele
Weil auch ich gemordet hab."

And everything that you control
And everything done in a pinch
In case you're lost babe, I brought a map

Every turned head coming in slapped
Maybe changing your guy could
Could be your misguided lie
Perhaps a combo of all these things

Turned up so loud that IN ARREARS, STEALS THE CLOUDS
I've never been here and though you're physically near
You're pushing me away to decay like the days that I loved

There is a girl, blabbing nothing outside my window
What do I have to show
To a world that the only way to destroy
Is to die like a baby boy
I could be happy in infinity
Of the space of my eyelid
But I know I'm somewhere else
Where the words on this page
Wouldn't be the scribbling nonsense they are,

A man in a mission
and a man on a mission
Crockett and Koresh
Two guys named Dave
livin? in the old southwest.
One lived in Waco
the other just below
in San Antonio
the f**kin' Alamo!
Both took on a country
and died in an ashtray
Waco, the Alamo
towering inferno
taking heat from Mexico
and gas from Janet Reno
one Dave made the history books
with glory for his trauma
the other made the headlines
and a mini-docudrama.
Both took on a country
and died in an ashtray
but who was the hero?
and who was the psyco?
In the East to take your life
before defeat is to die with honor.
In the West we praise the man
who tried but died a hopeless goner."

Finding there is no tomorrow only this place that you are
That you are alone in your darkness let your spirit go
When judgement comes it'll lay by the side of the road
By the road
Leaving all the worlds behind it seems so vain to me
Think' 'bout the past I only see my broken youth
Locked inside a world where only liars seem to live
Not a chance for happiness
His mother's checkered past
Psychologically induced by all the things he'd seen
What the hell is going on inside

Chorus

Thou shall not give unto life without love
What price for life
For ye shall open the scar of the wound
What price for truth
Thou shall not take from the weaker mankind
What price for youth
Fate begets sorrow the trail of doom

I can see the visions it's emitting from you mind
Dig another grave so I can bury you alive
You're a poison ocean that's been running through the rye
What the hell is going on inside
What price for life
What price for truth
What price for youth

Chorus

Schizophrenic symptoms of a problem in your past
Handed down to newborn generations to be cast
Take your friend's emotions and dissolve it with a lie
Put your plague to rest when you fall down and fucking die
And the mother cried
And the child cried
And the father replied
I guess I went to far
I guess I went to far
I guess I went to far
Then he heard a voice and it said
""now it's time to go, your soul is getting cold
I'm gonna leave your spirit dead by the side of the road""

But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill... )

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr

Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still

You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

Refrain

Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
What would remain?  The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
when in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
so if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

You harbor the hurt and you shelter the pain


Too proud to confess that you'd fallen again
But don't you long for mercy's tender embrace
Remember the works you spoke from your heart
It's a pity those phrases have fallen apart
Gone is every promise that you made

For many years I've been held inside this wishing well

I can't see anymore I've tried to reason my life
I can't feel anymore I find it hard to survive
And God will I see the day I will be free

I will be free

If somebody hears
Then I'm proud I've been a lucky one
But sometimes I fear it's been a waste and the worst is yet to come

I can't give anymore everything's been taken away
And the ones I adore keep getting farther each day
God let me believe the day I will be free

I will be free

Can you see me at all do you care to understand
Can you hear me at all will you turn your eyes again
God let me believe the day I will be free

I will be free"
64,Sandro,La Vida Sigue Igual,TRXSXNU128F9339150,1994,"El tiempo y el destino me han golpeado sin cesar
mas yo sigo adelante sin dejarme doblegar
pues no vale llorar tampoco suplicar
hay que pensar que todo pasará.

Yo tuve los amigos que el dinero puede dar
y en noches de bohemia nos dejabamos ahogar
mas todo ya paso el tiempo lo llevo
y aquí ya ves yo estoy y río igual.

Hey! al final la vida sigue igual

El vino las mujeres la parranda y el amor
son cosas que en la vida recompensan el dolor
debemos sonreir morirnos por vivir
porque al final de qué vale sufrir.

Yo le aposté a la vida que jamás iba a llorar
y a veces le hice trampas para poderle ganar
pues yo no sé perder nací para triunfar
a aquí ya ves yo estoy y río igual.

Hey! al final la vida sigue igual

Si a veces una pena desgarró mi corazón
seguí siempre adelante sin prestar mucha atención
al viento yo me alié y la pena se fue
porque el dolor mi amigo siempre fue.

Jamás se cumpliran aquellas cosas que soñé
pues en mi largo viaje tantos sueños olvidé
mas tanto recogí y ya tanto viví
que pienso hoy que yo nada perdí.

Hey! al final la vida sigue igual"

pienso en inviernos que volvieron,
sin ti,
no es igual.

Busco en tus ojos mi destierro;
sigo tus pasos, voy a tientas,
dí;
¿a dónde van?

Y quise llorar
por ti y por mí
un día más.

La luna esconde su mirada,
y yo, yo quiero conquistarla.
Ya ves,
todo sigue igual.

Un llanto lento, un llanto amargo,
un llanto, al fin, desesperado.
Y yo,
yo no sé llorar.

Y quise soñar
por ti y por mí
un día más.

Y no me asusta gritar,
tu nombre en la oscuridad,
en este exilio que
me has obligado a compartir.

Es como un filo de navaja
este camino que ahora sigo,
amor
no volveré..."

Mark one down for the city
One more grown baby boy is sleepin' on the sidewalk tonight
Wide round eyes, wide round lights
Can be full but without substance
In an instant you can hear an angel
Spread its wings and fly away

You're in the city
Where you lay down your dreams
You can feel it, through the sidewalk
A heartbeat beneath your feet
Where they'll let you smell the water
Then tell you ""you can't drink,
You're in the city now""

There's a cry, there's a roar
There's a howl that never ends
There's a silence that runs wide as it runs deep
And unspoken, broken people
Lying in the doorways
The light within them sputters and flickers
Like it almost had never been

You're in the city
Where you lay down your dreams
You can feel it, through the sidewalk
A heartbeat beneath your feet
Where they'll let you smell the water
Then tell you ""you can't drink,
You're in the city now""

There's a light and it is you
There's a light and it is me
There's a hope that's round and hollow
As a paper moon on a string
We can be perfect, we can be stronger
Saints are sinners who just tried longer
I am certainly no saint
But I surely heard the call

You're in the city
Where you lay down your dreams
You can feel it, through the sidewalk
A heartbeat beneath your feet
Where they'll let you smell the water
Then tell you ""you can't drink,
You're in the city now"""

Stormy weather days make us go our separate ways
Where our love was so at ease

And I dream of a place
Where we could be together at last
A matchbox of our own
A fence of real chain link
A grill out on the patio
Disposal in the sink
A washer and a dryer and an ironing machine
In a tract house that we share
Somewhere that's green

He rakes and trims the grass
He loves to mow and weed
I cook like Betty Crocker
And I look like Donna Reed
There's plastic on the furniture
To keep it neat and clean
In the Pine-Sol scented air
Somewhere that's green

Between our frozen dinner
And our bedtime, nine-fifteen
We snuggle watchin' Lucy
On our big, enormous twelve-inch screen
I'm his December Bride
He's Father, he Knows Best
Our kids watch Howdy Doody
As the sun sets in the west
A picture out of Better Homes and Gardens magazine
Far from Skid Row
I dream we'll go
Somewhere that's green"

without thinking, without trying 
I make that face the face you used to hate 
So it's been this way between you and me 
can we ever change is this how it has to be 
we try to patch things up but it's not the same 
we try to show respect it's too late in the game 

Can you take me back to yesterday 
so I can say all the things I didn't say 
maybe times were tough and maybe things were worse 
but I don't remember it that way 

the times the wasted times

Happy golden days of yore.

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.

He loved Wild Bird and raised horses, and fought in World War Two.
Now he and his brother married the same girl, and if you're still confused, my uncle married my grandma when my daddy was only 2. 

Grandpa Doc and Uncle Brooks would get along just fine. Hellraisin' in a '65 'Cuda, lovin' brothers til closing time. But her name came up, they'd go toe-to-toe, everybody'd hit the door.
By the time the Sheriff'd get to 'em, they'd be out cold on the floor. 

I do believe, they done passed it down, I'm out bird-doggin' chicks all over town. 
The Lord or the school won't do no good, I'm out getting' froggylike ever' hophead should.

Now when I was 13, my daddy left home, and it was plain to see---
There's whisky in the water in Coal Creek, Tennessee. But it ain't no thang, 'cause I got a brand-new bang from God's own sacred weed. I'll spend the rest of my screwed up life, feelin' kinda froggy."

I just wanna crash her

Well, it's not because of her beauty 
and her brand new low cut blouse.
It's not because she's so snooty 
or a fine famed millionaire.

It's not 'cause she's in motion 
In a brand new Cadillac car
It's not because of her lotion

Like measles on the map
Sprouting in all directions
From Mother Russia's lap
The dream of independence
Seeking identify
As the old orders crumble
But you must learn to see

Greatness! Raise the flag
Show your kids now proud it flies
This, my son, is God's own country
For its honour you must die

We are the chosen ones
This blood and soil is sacred
We above the rest

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war
Chaos and damnation: nation over nation

Power is the key
That's behind the rhetoric
Patriotic anesthetic
Blinded crowds fall for the trick

Parades and uniforms
Masking internal crisis
Afterming foreign threats

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war
Chaos and damnation: nation over nation

Ethnic manipulation
The curse of racial pride
Abuse by powermongers
Commiting genocide

""Nation"" is a scheme
giving power to elites
ideology concealing
exploitation and deceit

We are the chosen ones
This blood and soil is sacred
We above the rest

Nation over nation: myth of supremacy
People over people: chauvinist bigotry
Nation over nation: calls for hate, envy and war

in the place where I was born 
Someone's got the roses 
'cause my people got the thorns; 
My people are the poor ones, 
their country made of stones 
Their wealth is in persistence, 
in stories and in bones

and one green hill, one green hill 
one far green hill we carry everywhere

The tide must have a turning, 
the wind must have a change 
Children go to cities 
where the stars look strange 
And memory's a winding path, 
shining in the rain 
To places where we parted 
and we shall not meet again

on one green hill, one green hill 
one far green hill we carry everywhere

And somewhere in the story, 
it came as no surprise 
One time, for all time, the rain got in my eyes…

It might be tears of laughter, 
it might be tears of rage 
You hate it and you love it 
and it rattles at your cage 
My people are survivors, living in the cracks 
Whatever bad luck hands them, 
they keep on coming back

to one green hill, one green hill 
one far green hill we carry everywhere"

And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires,
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge,
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
Heal your shrinking soul,
But there won't be a single thing
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car? 
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect,
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head,
On the TV screen
And hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand"

Although you pretend,

So many times you tried to break away
Always falling back
Tried so hard, never really made it
So many days you never woke up
So many nights just staring at the screen
Try to get a grip now
Pity yourself doesn't really help you

Turn on the gas
No one really cares

So many things you never found out
So many places where you didn't go
Standing still and waiting
Hoping for something to finally happen
So many conversations we had
So many times I couldn't stay awake
Like some sort of drug
Everyone around you is falling asleep"

Indifference is a drug that I see people buy 
at the local store, local store 
You, you, you think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see

What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be

You just feel what you want it to be 
What you want it to feel 
What you want it to be 

The man in the moon has a cold in the back of his head today 
So dark is the river as the old bridge of lovers 
finds it's getting washed all away 
There are three wise men in the darkness of the desert 
Still trying to be finding their way 
The tables have been laid and the food has been served 
But the cost of eating is too much for most to pay 

You think a little love is all you need 
But love is such a small thing can't you see

Is her oldest memory
She was only two
It's the first time she felt blue

Cafeteria, Harrison
Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without shoes

7 up, I touched her thumb
And she knew it was me
Although she couldn't see
Unless of course she peeked

My mom's good, she got me out of
Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
You know how that goes

That's where she still was the summer
She turned 17
In 1983
Three weeks after me

Last I heard was she had twins
Or maybe it was three
Although I've never seen
But that don't bother me"

So now you see me and know
You can check it and go
'Cause I'm so bored
That I can't even pretend no more,
It's so pathetic that I'm rolling around on the floor
Laughing at one big gag
And every now and then they pull another rabbit out of the bag
of sad diversions, useless tedious excursions,
Roll into unrealistic, crypto-fascistic,
Comedy doctrine, kick the ballistics
Again and again and again, just say when
Ya had enough, sad enough or mad enough
To do something simple and kind,
Now is the time
A change of state of mind.

I am a loner, a zoner. I utilize the microphone
And if they try a tap I leave 'em hangin' on the telephone.
They're wasted, so wasted, so
They're waiting for the visitors so they can go and try again
On the next step, on the next one.
Come on and get some, jet some, static, solid-state, automatic.
Sporadic and random - 'cause nobody planned 'em.
Anarchy, free thought can't be bought,
So disregard the lessons and the shit you've been taught.
I'm saying it and now they're playing it to me
Larger than life every day and this is what they say:

Shut your mouth and get back in line
And if you don't like it -
Well it suits us just fine.
We pull the levers
We hold the strings
And these are just a few of our favourite things.
Learn the words of the company song
""White is right is right is strong"".
Come on children all sing along
'Cause if you think you can change
You were never more wrong.

No fuck that - you won't take me
You won't break me and you'll never make me
Step in line or step march in time.
Well you can violate my body but my soul is still mine.
You must think that I'm fucking stupid, man,
If you think I'm gonna hang with the program,
Some fool schedule.
I don't give a shit about
What is or what isn't cool.
I make the rules, I stand alone
And if they try a tap I leave 'em hangin' on the telephone.
One of these days I'm gonna get sectioned,
I bet they even say it's for my own protection.
Rejection leads straight to correction.
Look out, here comes a strange injection
They've got a drug to numb my erection,
But they won't take this from me:
My state of mind."

Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom 'n' papa told me, ""Son, you gotta make some money""
""If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday""
Well, I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
""Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick""
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well, I called my congressman and he said quote, 
""I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote""
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm a-gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do 
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Yeah, sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do 
Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
No there ain't no cure for the summertime blues"
89,David Lee Roth,You're Breathin' It (2007 Remastered Album Version),TRVWYES128F4234B36,1994,"We burnt the city down here late last night
Dante's inferno meets the Price is Right
A lot like in the movies and it smelled like victory
I barely made it through with some new shoes and a few CDs
""1-800-SEE-YA"", I heard somebody cheer
Now it's about a twelve mile walk to get a goddamn beer

It makes you cry
It makes you laugh
It makes you pissed
Don't have a heartattack

Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it
Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it

I saw this TV show on toxic waste
Just when I'm gettin' kinda used to the taste
I don't mind some danger, so I took a little hit
And now a message 'bout the ozone layer
You're Breathin' It

And it smells so bad
It'll smack ya through the window so hard
You're pissin' Windex, no foolin'
Picknicking hard in your moma's backyard
With a Philly's blunt and an uzi in the cooler

It makes you cry
It makes you laugh
It makes you pissed
Don't have a heartattack

Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it
Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it

Ah, ah, ah, ah

And if you think that violence
Never solved a thing, I differ
It solved some crackhead dealer
Down on 14th street much quicker
Explosions way uptown
And if you're wondering where our homeboy is 'bout now
(You're Breathin' Him...)

Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it
Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it

Street life, night life
Sex life, wild life
You're breathin' it, breathin' it

Or put this off forever
Always counting on luck
Keeps my mind in a rut
I can't keep ignoring signals

Bombarding me from every side
I can run - but I can't hide

All the facts after the fact
To live this tragedy
It happens time and time again
Analyze until we're paralyzed
We can't comprehend

Here's the info that I need
Now I'll play the devil's advocate
This excess we feed
Is wisdom we don't need
Now I'm afraid to place my bet

Information overload
My head is ready to explode

All the facts after the fact
To live this tragedy
It happens time and time again
Analyze until we're paralyzed
We can't comprehend

Ulterior motives - secret pacts
No one knows all the facts
Hidden message - double talk
Fallen prophets, no safe place to walk

Information up to here
It's no wonder we all live in fear

All we get are opinions
Analysis Paralysis
Overkill - now we can't comprehend

Freedom, not free, freedom

Even when kept in restraint the spirit continues to thrive

A monument to complete

There's a search for something to say
Something to share, something to speak
A monument to convey

Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it passion or just a profession
Is it performance, is it expression
Is it passion or just an obsession

There's a photograph there's a frame
There's a time, a moment to confine
Something to save, something to see
A monument to enshrine

Is it performance, is it expression
Is it passion or just a profession
Is it fiction, is it confession
Is it passion or just an obsession

There's an empty room there's a blank page
There's a picture left incomplete
Something is lost, something remains
A monument to defeat

When I'm giving You the rest of my life
It's no sacrifice
As long as I shall live
I'll be giving You the rest of my life
With all that I have
No idle promises
I'm giving You the rest of my life

I wanna pay You back
With something precious
This is what my wish is
There's just one thing I have
That's mine to give You
It's Yours to keep forever
Whatever time on this earth I've got left
Whatever happens, for the worst or the best

Lord, I'm giving You the rest of my life
It's no sacrifice
As long as I shall live
I'll be giving You the rest of my life
With all that I have
No idle promises
I'm giving You the rest of my life

Don't know what the future holds for me
There's no way to see
(No way, no way, yeah)
But if I just hold on to Your love
I've got it all, what else do I need

Giving You the rest of my life
It's no sacrifice
As long as I shall live
I'll be giving You the rest of my life
With all that I have
No idle promises
I'm giving You the rest of my life

Giving You the rest of my life

All my life ahead of me
That's the way it ought to be
Circus take me away
Yonder where I've been again
Then I'll be back again
Be a brand new day

See the girlie on TV
Wonder if she could see me
By the funny magazines of talk
It's a secret part of me, secret identity
Love to lvoe my honey all night long
Take a walk around the block
See the future of the clock
No good in forgetting

If I wasa circus man
Only you would understand
There's a story there to tell
See your brother burn in hell"

She'd like to marry

She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her

The one for her, the one for her

We courted round the moon
incessantly she circles
And as I dive on through
She opens up the other side
Beckoning my air
Calling on my muscle
In her sacred ring, life and death tussle

She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
The one for her, the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
The one for her, the one for her

In the costume of a live woman
The princess walks right through the mirror
She didn't need any dishwashing gloves
I didn't know that death could love
Like in the film by Jean Cocteau
As if I were Orpheus
I thought she was the one for me
So does everybody

A parade down the aisle
As one enormous family
All married to her ball
Necessary polygamy
We came from her colors
Penetrating her softness
And though she sometime yields
She has the Last Word.

She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
The one for her, the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
She said I was the one for her
The one for her, the one for her

You must have took me for some golden boy
You didn't know what you were taking on
It was a hard up case

It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case

Now all the angles have been played in three's
There isn't much that I can say
I know you gave your little heart to me
I guess I threw the thing away
It was a hard up case

It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case

Sometimes the truth is kind of hard to find
But don't you worry I can read your mind


And you don't have to tell me to my face
You put some other joker in my place

They dealt us houses full with the queens and kings
And now they're calling out our bluff
'cause you and me girl we had everything
But it just wasn't quite enough
Now that's a hard up case

It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case
It was a hard up case
Just another hard up case

You say the truth is gonna set me free
Like you might throw a dog a bone
I know you're thinking that the joke's on me
Just take a look at what you 're dragging home --

Into an inharmonic whole, to an inharmonic whole
Consciousness has plagued us and we cannot shake it
Though we think we're in control, though we think we're in control

Questions that besiege us in life
Are testament of our helplessness
There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again

Time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes but they can't
Explain why it should slip away, explain why it should slip away
History and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
Rooted in the present day, rooted in the present day

Questions that besiege us in life
Are testament of our helplessness
There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate it will all happen again

If you came to conquer, you'll be king for a day
But you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away
And believe these words you hear
When you think your path is clear

We have no control, we have no control
We have no control, we do not understand
You have no control, you are not in command
You have no control, we have no control

No control

I keep crawling back to you

The chambermaid awoke surprised
thought she'd seen the last of him
She shook her head and let him in

Hey baby, there's something in your eyes
Tryin' to say to me
That I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you
It's all I want to do

It was me and my sidekick
He was drunk and I was sick
We were caught up in a barroom fight
Till an Indian shot out the lights

I'm so tired of being tired
Sure as night will follow day
Most things I worry about
Never happen anyway

I keep crawling back to you"

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the gods of love decide to knock
You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanor stone cold sober

The officer who stopped me said
""lucky you didn't wind up dead!""
And he guessed that I was over and above
I hoped he'd only caution me
And i made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that i was only drunk on love

Caught in a trap

Tearing up your soul Your soul will be what she destroys

She'll lift you up If you're alone tonight
You'll be okay 'Til you're back is turned
You'll feel the knife When will you ever learn

With the twist of the moment
When you are feeling The pleasure of her pain

She will come, she'll be looking for you
There's nothing that you can do about it

To feel her anger Will you feel her knife?
Or will you get on the train? Out of here tonight? Out of here tonight?

She'll tear your soul And drain your brain
Now she has her toy She's feeling great
With the feeling of danger

To run away from murder

She will come with a vengeance for you

She will come with a weapon for you

And turned it into you
I stared directly in your face
But failed to see a trace

Not quite true romance
My superior and I
Facts fall down wanting every time we try

We kiss and fix whatever's wrong
But I don't stay kissed long
It's work to get things straight and then
To lose it all again

Not quite true romance
My superior and I
Can't fall down wanting every time we try

Show me that surface where the eyes meet the image
I'll show you where the hook went in
Small expectations greet the lies and spiders
Filling in a window frame
Long pretty god-boys lurk in corners
Looking murder in the face again

It ties our hands behind our backs
And drops us in our tracks
It gives us slumber party chills
And undermines our wills

Not quite true romance
My superior and I
Facts fall down wanting every time we try"

Comes burning through and it's all bright.
Come round in bed with a throbbing head
And nothing seems to go quite right.

Forgetting mind and hearts? are blind to reason or delight.
And I can't seem to come to terms to face the brand new day

I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down
I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down
I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down


Voices sound like they're too loud, it's up too fierce and great.
A vicious slash, my temper lost, controlling starts too late.
I have killed a friend of mine, my conscience starts to pain.
I have to trem? these solos just to ease this guilty brain.

I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down
I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down
I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down

I'm breaking down, I'm breaking down, down, down, down

The Earth will pass by if the ransom is right.
Don't worry I won't cause you any harm
My only weapon is my charm.

Because I've got no plans
I've got no time to waste.
I am the goddess of your own good taste
Hold me there, hold me so tight
Kidnap me, I won't put up a fight, because...

You and me, a love rendezvous somewhere in paradise.
You and me, a love rendezvous of love that's out of sight.

Paddy's a horse and Stevie got uptight.
But I'm a tellin' you everything is alright.
I'll make a drop, I'll honour the deal
We'll be love banditos it'll feel so real.

You name the place, I'll name the time.
Just come along, it'll be so sublime.
I wanna feel good deep in your arms
I wanna bathe in your own sweet charms

Und wenn ein Mann auch mal charmant sein konnte
denn sagte sie auch nich nee.

Sie schmuste an' Heck mit Knut und war
von' Met schon reichlich high.
Rollo biss vor Wut ins Segel und schrie:
""Hier wird gerudert und nich geschludert!""

bis du die dicken Augen zu hast!""

""Kauf' dir 'ne Kassenbrille vonne AOK.

That my prayers are being heard
Lately it seems
They have all been wasted words
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

I know we could change
The sadness into smiles
If we could all see the world
Through the eyes of a child
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

If everybody has the same thoughts
And everybody shares the same dream
Can't we get together
And make this world a better place

I had a dream
All our hatred turned into love
And every river of tears
Dried up into dust
Every woman and man
Standing side by side
Then we walked across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

If everybody has the same throughts
And everybody shares the same dream
Can't we get together
And make this world a better place

I want to believe
That my prayers are being heard
Lately it seems
They have all been wasted words
How many prayers will it take
How many tears must we cry
Till we can walk across that bridge of hope
To peace on the other side

Can we talk across that bridge of hope
And find peace
Sweet peace
On the other side"

In my arms I hold you near
With my lips I kiss you dear
I won't want to wake up
And face this new day

Only one heart, only one heart
What made you take it and break it apart?
Only one heart, only one heart
Lord why did you make us with only one heart?

When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train.

Old Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
Well, they have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky.
Everyone's so busy they can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people so damn many people alone
When you're alone life just don't seem worth living
While you're alive gotta learn to live with the pain.
You've been grown for so long
There's no one left who'll forgive
You find yourself searching your mind
For the links to the chain.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine

I drop the face and play the game
I growl at familiar strangers
The sands are needles there
The dust will crawl in anguish
Like the bones inside my lair

Move into the circle
You fall on your knees
And we die here waiting
You fall on your knees

Won't somebody tell me why
Somebody please show me where

In this bitter midnight air
We melt inside of centuries
Awaiting new arrivals
Dressing in lost shadows
Like costumes for the dying

Of being rich or being poor
Such a shame
But it's then, then that faith arrives
To make you feel at least alive
And that's why you should keep on aiming high
Just seek yourself and you will shine

You've go to search for the hero inside yourself
Search for the secrets you hide
Search for the hero inside yourself
Until you find the key to your life

In this life, long and hard though it may seem
Live it as you'd live a dream
Aim so high
Just keep the flame of truth burning bright
The missing treasure you must find
Because you and only you alone
Can build a bridge across the stream
Weave your spell in life's rich tapestry -
Your passport to a feel supreme

Search for the secrets you hide

I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five

Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up

(Andre)
Time is slippin', slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm havin a ball, makin' my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to servin when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how can I refrain
from being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., niggas, ain't no changin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, your niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit with pimp shit, I'm slangin' it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fuckin' mouth

Do it now before you die
Soothe your temper

And give your lungs some exercise

Then get your brush
And we'll paint the town
A lighter shade of grey and brown
And it won't mean a thing

And in round two
We'll fight like Ali
And by the end
Of the second round
We'll be singing
You and whose army
Are gonna stop us now

That's the way I felt today
I didn't feel it yesterday
Tomorrow, I just couldn't say
It never comes here anyway

And when the clouds obscure the moon
And normal service is resumed
It won't mean a thing

Because in round two
We fought like Ali
And by the end of the second round

Through the window pain
Lies dead upon the floor
While unseen eyes
Crouch low behind
The walls so thin...
The pious curse the holy
So evening curse the day

I should have known its name
years consume the hours
Turning black to gray

Light the fire

You are the only one
To walk alone
In this desperate maze
Whose price has just begun

Drowning lies
In bottles of time
Shipwrecked for no one to see
Reaching as far
To other worlds

Wanna walk around the school yard with his tool hard
What could make the switch to call a woman a bitch
It probably dawned when you couldn't get a date to the prom
And you were stuck with Beavis
Let's leave us on a note of positivity
I'm saying this for levity
But if I leave it brief I call it brevity
I said I see the people rocking
Which means there's no stopping the flow
And you can just tell 'em that you know

Every night yeah we turning up
And comin' off live
Like and final 311 battle breakin idols
On the one you never heard before
You know the hardcore rockin
Pumping the dance floor
Leave ya feet sore lookin for your Micatin

There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste

I remember when I was your child
You made me up to be your lover
Now I'm standing right beside you

I don't pretend to love them less but darling
When you drive this way I lose my breath

160,La Renga,El Circo Romano,TRWNTSE128F427F40D,1994,"Necrofilia, no soy de carne y hueso
un gato muerto en la taza de café
promotoras sexuales de la timba,
un ciego vende la estampita de Gardel.
Y la demencia que desata la tormenta
entre orgías de contaminación,
no quiero ser una más del Circo Romano.

Mariposas de taco y siliconas
un decapitado me vende un geniol,
un ejecutivo se ahorcó con la corbata
y la crónica que pinta de terror.

Y la demencia...

Adónde va esa jauría rabiosa
todo por un hueso a fin de mes,
sauna caballero!
porno continuado!
aprieten el gatillo de a uno por vez.

Más masacre en el microcentro
muere un mendigo en la puerta de un hotel
la pizza se enfría, se volcó el vaso de vino
otro se acuesta en la vía del tren.

Y la demencia..."
161,Bucks Fizz,I Hear Talk,TRNMFGV12903CB30F1,1994,"It’s never been easy living with you
Dish of the season fishing for truth
But we got it rolling right on the track
Here’s to the future with no turning back
We’re taking half and half in mystery
We’re making love to love so easily
And still I can’t believe what’s going round
I don’t believe you’d ever let me down

I hear talk, I hear the writings on the wall
Too many private eyes and party lines
Secret signs friends who seem to know it all
I hear talk, I hear talk

Talk
I look in your eyes and what do I see
Everything I needed looking at me
Beyond all suspicion dreams on the side
Hold that position ticket to ride
So when it’s all wrapped up 
Like it’s meant to be
The only trap that’s left is jealousy
And still I can’t believe what’s going round
I don’t believe you’d ever let me down

I hear talk, I hear the writings on the wall
Too many private eyes and party lines
Secret signs friends who seem to know it all
I hear talk, I hear talk

Chinese whispers circulate
There’s a news man leaning on the garden gate
If you don’t wanna headline better use your head
‘Cause I heard someone say something you said

I hear talk, I hear the writings on the wall
Too many private eyes and party lines
Secret signs friends who seem to know it all
I hear talk, I hear talk

Talk talk talk"
162,Confederate Railroad,Notorious (LP Version),TRHFUVT128F148B60C,1994,"Riding north on Interstate 75
With a nervous fading beauty sitting by his side
And the pistol that he used to pave the way
Down the long black stretches of a dark highway
Ray bought his future with a pound of lead
When he robbed a liquor store and left the clerk for dead
That kid should've put the money in the sack
But he didn't and now there ain't no turning back

He's a desperate rider, he's a Jesse James
The best that he could hope for is a household name
There ain't nobody that a man can trust
When all his headlines read 'Notorious'
There ain't nobody that a man can trust
When all his headlines read 'Notorious'

They pulled out of Soddy Daisy 'bout twelve o'clock
Took the heat stroke with the lights off to avoid the roadblock
Ray killed the motor at the county line
Changed his Tennessee plates to a 'lost tag' sign
She would never ask what the boy had done
But she said she'd be his hostage if he needed one
Her mama raised her to be loyal and true
And she figured that's the least that she could do
She was lost and lonely on a midnight ride
Reluctant Bonnie to a poor man's Clyde
It ain't too easy when the man you love
Has got a reputation that's notorious
It ain't too easy when the man you love
Has got a reputation that's notorious

They were just outside of Knoxville when the lights flashed on
And the sirens started howling like hell hound dogs
Ray popped that Firebird into overdrive
He swore he'd never let them take him alive
He was a desperate rider, he was Jesse James
The best he'd ever hoped for was a household name
The morning papers didn't say too much
But his obituary read, 'Notorious'

The caption by his picture didn't say too much
But his obituary read, 'Notorious'"

Corridor of creation
We see lands divide
Nation against nation
Like comets they collide
And we pray
We pray for the unseen
To be seen by the eyes of man
When heaven and earth are hand in hand
Thy will be done
Damn, get set for damage
Prepare the soul
To control and manage
Cut the groove
Make it rough like a chainsaw
Inject a beat eat meat like carnivore
Trumpets sound
And wrath pours down
Angels dance to the new groove in town
Clouds part
Sky opens wide
No place to run, no place to hide
Love rain down on me
Don't want to see it
Just wanna feel it
Love knows no boundary
Gotta believe it
And you'll receive it

Love - let it rain (8x)
Love

Tribes 144 on the mount
Like an exodus to the final count
Music is blasting, silence everlasting
The call of the cosmos got the
Planets dancing, 2 send a new wibe
New ray new day
A spiritual experience
Is gonna come you way
A vision a vibe with a touch too tender
Your love to the lord
Now it's time to surrender
Love rain down on me
Don't want to see it
Just wanna feel it
Love knows no boundary
Gotta believe it
And you'll receive it
Let it rain (8x)

Is slowly dying
Suburban moon
It never lives
The wife just nods when you get home now
You stay together for the kids

Six o'clock
You watch the headlines
By half past ten
Your eyes are glued
You spent the daylight making deadlines
Tonight the TV is making you

You may watch the world in color
In the corner burning bright
You may watch the world in color
But you dream in black and white

The shadows flicker
Across your face now
The image sinks
Inside your brain
With just a few more magic dollars
You could make yourself a name

Sporty cars
Surround your castle
With a roof antenna
Reaching to the sky
A commercial message for the good life
Is just a simulated lie

You may watch the world in color
Your only friend when times are tight
You may watch the world in color
But you dream in black and white"

The music's inviting but I'm staying off of my feet
The floor's getting crowded, but I don't wanna take part
I bet you can guess it's got someting to do with my heart

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

The partners are chosen, look at them waltzing away
The tempo gets slower, closer and closer they sway
I've had my moments when I could get lost in the sound
But when the song ended the one in my arms let me down

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

Have you been in my shoes?
I serch your eyes for signs
Will you remain, remember my name
After closing time

I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while

I'm only in between dances
Sitting it out for a while"

He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity

Your god is dead and no one cares
If there is a Hell I'll see you there

He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name

As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows"

You won't hit me on my blind side

I had been blinded by too much need
Old voices bad choices to appease
I'm not who I was, that's done and that's that
And no other man's going to do me like that

But I'm talkin' time, and I'm checkin' mine
I know it goes both ways
But I'm well aware of a chip that's sittin' here
On my shoulder

I believe in reason I believe in vision
I still have nightmare sin the dark
I still have a few tender places
Somewhere in the center of my heart

But I'm talkin' time, and I'm checkin' mine
I know it goes both ways
But I'm well aware of a chip that's sittin' here
On my shoulder

So OI love you like I love no other
I'm sorry when you pay for the crimes of another
I'm sorry I hurt you, you're sorry I cried
I'm sorry when I don't trust you 'cause someone else lied

But I'm takin' time, and I'm checkin' mine
And I won't let the past
Keep me down at all set me up to fall

But I must stay and you must go;

You have always been such a good friend to me,
Through the thunder and the rain,
And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York,
Lift your heart and think of me;

There are those who fail, there are those who fall,
There are those who will never win,
Then there are those who fight for the things they believe,
And these are men like you and me;

In my dream we walked, you and I to the shore
Leaving footprints by the sea,
And when there was just one set of prints in the sand,
That was when you carried me;

You have always been such a good friend to me,
Through the thunder and the rain,
And when you're feeling lost in the snows of New York,
Lift your heart and think of me;

stumbling up at one
and put the kettle on

I put the TV on
but where's the drama gone
in the afternoon
and time is all that passes

someone came by my bedroom today
swaying around, then silently away
someone left home and my bedroom today
left by the time I slumbered away

Il y aura certainement,
Sur les tables en fer blanc
Quelques vases vides et qui traînent
Et des nuages pris aux antennes
Je t'offrirai des fleurs
Et des nappes en couleurs
Pour ne pas qu'Octobre nous prenne

On ira tout en haut des collines
Regarder tout ce qu'Octobre illumine
Mes mains sur tes cheveux
Des écharpes pour deux
Devant le monde qui s'incline

Certainement appuyés sur des bancs
Il y aura quelques hommes qui se souviennent
Et des nuages pris sur les antennes
Je t'offrirai des fleurs
Et des nappes en couleurs
Pour ne pas qu'Octobre nous prenne

Et sans doute on verra apparaître
Quelques dessins sur la buée des fenêtres
Vous, vous jouerez dehors
Comme les enfants du nord

Hot humid, and miserable""

[Ice Cube]
The Jungle Man is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[Maulkie]
Cause I'm a G with the LM
You better run and tell em
The trick ass bitches are gettin dumped in the ditches
All day so you know it's all good
I'm off from token more like Masta Goden
I'm iceberg slim, cause I'm cool like that
I'm gee like that, a girl-handed gat
It ain't no thang for me to watch people hang
Cause he don't wanna rumble in my motherfuckin jungle
[Ice Cube]
Short dog is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[Short]
Cause I'ma G, sippin on the tropical thriller
You hear the roar, down boy it's my big gorilla killer
As the bad guy, lookin for an alibi
Don't swing by on the peril vines
Go to the finish, big Texas is next
Stuck him in the neck and I'm beatin on my chest
[Ice Cube]
T-Bone is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[T-Bone]
Cause I'ma G, get back as I gat at the fear
I pack my gear with the hard rock tip I digs it in the dip
Out of the dip comes a thrill with the pointed tip
The devil don't do shit, I keeps my hand on my bamboo spear
Oh dear, I smell fear coming from the rear of the jungle
No wonder, he's done hoe
Niggaz find the bozo oh no, the king of the jungle

[CHORUS]
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
I'm the k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-k-king
Uh get upa, get down
Get on upa, get down
Get on upa, get down
Get on upa get down

[Ice Cube]
The jungle man is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[Maulkie]
Motherfuckin is talk, the Lench Mob fell off
There's no proof in his breath with the tech to get wrecked
Gorilla pimp slappin on this hoe ass tricks
JD pick me up, oh this doll has nice tits
The Mob is deep, with the stars intention
Bestebas still killin and lynchin
Fool, this is Lench Mob so feel the wrath
Young motherfuckers don't even know the half
[Ice Cube]
Short dog is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[Shorty]
And that's me, deep in the jungle where the Dog is the one
Let me count a gun on the singular drum
Dum, ditty dum ditty ditty dum dum
Here we come here we come, here we kitty come come
Bring the thunder the black magic wonder
Lench mob'll get 'cha just don't whip me with no whip
Razzamatazz I do a drive like Shabazz
I blast from the past, hittin that ass
[Ice Cube]
T-Bone is the king of the jungle
Bout as strong as he can be
[T-Bone]
Who me? ""Yes"" Back to the jungle vines swingin
Ding a linging broke a neck back and lookin for some red neck crackas
Rigged and givin the fuckin shit when I check 1, 2

186,Victoria Williams,My Ally  (LP Version),TRBPGVY128F427D4E9,1994,"No we don’t make passionate love 
No we don’t even kiss and hug 
Not a lot of jealousy 
I’m friends with you 
I hope you’re friends with me 

You’re my ally 

Worn out grudges just don’t exist 
Spin around till we’re tired of this 
We don’t care who owes who 
You don’t own me I don’t own you 

You’re my ally 

Standing on the pavement 
Looking like an accident 
Waiting on the weekend 
Catch you in the wind 

You’re my ally"
187,Los Suaves,No Me Mires,TRGUJED128F421549F,1994,"No me mires cuando cruces
Por la acera de mi calle
No me mires cuando pases
Por esta calle sin luces
Mírame cuando la luna
Se asoma por la ventana
Y te dejas abrazar
Acostada aquí en mi almohada.

No me mires cuando escuches
Al reloj decir que es tarde
No te escondas no te marches
Como estrellas entre nubes
Quédate cuando la luna
Se asoma por la ventana
Y te dejas abrazar
Acostada aquí en mi almohada.

Que pena me da ¡que pena!
Cuando te veo marchar
Que solo y triste me dejas
Cuando la noche se va
Dime por que no te quedas
Esta vez un poco más
Es que quieres que me muera
O es que me quieres matar."
188,PFR,Life Goes On  (Great Lengths Album Version),TRREYGR128F425A5CE,1994,"the sun will shine 
i'll smile from time to time 
and sin the song 
cause life goes on 

Chorus  
but it won't mean a thing 
without you and the love you bring 
it won't mean a thing 
without you 

the wounds will heal 
starting over ain't no big deal 
they rebuilt rome 
and life goes on 

Chorus  

the lesson learned 
we all must take our turn 
and carry on 
cause life goes on"
189,The Incredible String Band,Saturday Maybe,TRRECCX128E079334C,1994,"factory chimney cough yellow smoke 
trucks and trains go rumbling
throw down your key from your window high
your man's out drinking
neighbours thinking evil 
lead by the the lights of your electric fire
your grey slips falls around your feet
and across the sheet your nut brown curls go tumbling

we don't have long before he comes home from the bar
I'll be gone a week of sundays
meet me by the bronze horse or the clock tower
try to come Friday, Saturday maybe
don't cry now you'll freak the baby"
190,Gin Blossoms,Heart Away,TRZQLWQ12903CD39AE,1994,"(Robin Wilson)

Here's a little something that I brought here for you
It ain't much but it might just do
Fairly serious could hardly say
that I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away
It's never enough to feel and say
Throw my promises away
Several things that I could do
But I couldn't give my heart to you
I couldn't give my heart to you
Smokes on the table the matches are lost
There's room in the back of the bar
Fairly serious could hardly say
that I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away
Aw, it's not really serious but I should prove
That I don't mean what I might not do
Not that you wanted it anyway
but I couldn't give my heart away
I couldn't give my heart away..."
191,Mano Negra,Drives Me Crazy,TRTBLAX128E0781DC6,1994,"No fun baby
No place to be
Dancin' and drinkin'
You and me
And it drives me crazy

Maybe I'm just
An half grown boy
This town for me
Is a broken toy

And it drives me crazy

Here comes that thunderstorm again
My temperature's risin' all in vain

And it drives me crazy

Goodbye Paris
I'm leavin you
Nothing they said
About you is true
They say that you're
The city of joy
They say that you're
The real MC COY
Don't wanna be
Your lonely boy... and it Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy"
192,Freedy Johnston,Two Lovers Stop (LP Version),TRWUEVD128F92FE035,1994,"Lovers Cry
One last kiss by the edge they're hand in hand
Two lovers stop their hearts
Better than to be apart

They had run from a father to the highest bridge
Holding together as they jumped in

Lovers lie
On the hill where they once lay side by side
Two lovers stop their hearts
Better than to be apart

She was rich he was common but she wouldn't say no
Lyin' together on the rocks below
They had run from a father to the highest bridge
Holding together as they jumped in

Lovers cry
One last kiss by the edge they're hand in hand
Toe lovers stop their hearts
Better than to be apart

Lover cry, Lovers cry, Lovers cry
Lover cry, Lovers cry, Lovers cry
Lover cry, Lovers cry, Lovers cry
Lover cry, Lovers cry, Lovers cry-"

An appetizin' love recipe
Just like honey to honey bees
I just can't get enough
So fill me up, quench my appetite
I think you know what I have in mind and you got it
And I don't wanna let go

I'm burnin' with desire
I'm starvin' for your love, put out my fire
Oh, don't ask what you should do
Be the doctor, baby, I'm in need of cure
I hunger for your love

I hunger for your love, just a little bit
I hunger for your love, ooh, baby, I hunger
I hunger for your love, hunger for your love
I hunger for your love

Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger
Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger

A tantalizin' love fantasy
And when your body is close to me
I end up in a fuss
The heat is on and I start to sweat
I wanna take a bite
But I know you're not mine yet, but, baby, oh baby, I want you

I crave the way you move (do it, baby)
If I act too polite I just might lose
My chance at lovin' you
If what I'm thinkin' feels this pleasin'
Then the real thing will keep me screamin' for you

I hunger for your love, baby, I hunger for love
I hunger for your love
I hunger for your love, I hunger for your love
I hunger for your love

I'm burnin' with desire, baby
Your body heat just drives me crazy
I hunger for your love
I need your lovin' here tonight
To fill my lovin' appetite, I hunger
I hunger for your love

Hunger for your love
I hunger for your love
Hunger for your love

I'm starvin' and I need what's makin' me weak
Like a bee needs honey, baby, I need lovin'
Can I get it, come on
Can I get it, come on
Can I get it from you, baby, come on
I want you

So tell me what you wanna do
Delight me with the pleasures of you
Baby, I want ya
So fill me up with your love recipe

I hunger for your love, oh, I hunger for you baby, how I want you
I hunger for your love, it's so good, I need your love, do it baby
I hunger for your love, oh, baby, I hunger
I hunger for your love, for your love

I hunger for your love

Un Pierre, un Paul, un Jacques ou Tom
Peu m'importe comment il se nomme
S'il est un homme, un homme, un homme

Je n'exige pas un Apollon
Qui sait briller dans les salons
Ni un type fort comme un Samson
Pourvu que j'aie un mate un bon

Il n'a pas besoin d'être un milliardaire
Qu'il soit beau, non, ça m'est égal
Il n'a pas besoin d'être une grande lumière
Star du cinéma ni prince royal

Je cherche un homme, un homme, un homme
Qu'il s'appelle Pierre ou Paul ou Tom
Pourvu qu'il donne son maximum
Je cherche un homme, un homme, un homme

Doesn't have to be prince or movie star
A Texas oil man or a french marquis
Doesn't have to be handsome as a picture
An ordinary guy's all right with me

Je cherche un homme, un homme, un homme
Qu'il s'appelle Pierre ou Paul ou Tom
Pourvu qu'il donne son maximum

while you put your empty arms around me
kept my shirt on
and wrestled my memory down
when i put my arm around you
i had to hold my mand in place
i didn't move to keep you from feeling chased

dropping off
you smile easy
what was i supposed to say?
hits the ground 
and it dies easy
why did i decide to stay?

looks like i should forget you now
underneath the covers i'm not naked
maybe you were never next to me
does all recorded history start tomorrow morning?
did you forget or were your kisses my final warning?

a spent bullet brought me down
add me to the list you stopped with blanks
or how about a rundown of the top 100
where do i rank
did i even make the list
or did i make a big mistake?

dropping off
you smile easy
what was i supposed to say"

But I need the money
I can't keep a job
Cuz I'm too fucking stupid
So I'm in the alley
And I'm through the window
Yeah, this one is easy
I see there's nobody around

Well, how did this happen?
The whole place is empty
There ain't nothing in there
I hear the alarm
Then I see the camera
Then I see the spotlight
And I know that I've put my foot in the bucket again

Yes, he was my best friend
A long time and way back
And he looks like shit so
I invite him over
But the next day he's back
And he's got his duffel
Then he's sleeping over
The next thing I know he's moved in

So I come home from working
He's got ten people in there
I can't thrown them out
Cuz they won't listen
And the windows busted
And the couch cushion's smoking
Someone is bleeding
My foot's in the bucket again"

Another day on Highway 41
It's a long black snake that runs to the sun
My mama told me since the day I was born
Son, down in the southland is where you belong

So, I'm pitching nickels, pitching dimes
Talking trash and drinkin' wine
It's just another day in the life of me
Hard times and misery

I got a mansion looks like a shotgun shack
I draw my money from a cotton sack
But I finally found one thing that's free
That's been hard times and misery

Repeat Chorus

Watermelon's are hanging on the vine
Thirty some odd years of wasted time
When I wake up, Lord, that's all I see
It's hard times and misery
But there's a train that runs through this town
Every evening when the sun goes down
Tomorrow night at 8:03
No more hard times and misery

Repeat Chorus"

Cause hell is Earth, and the life is severen

Surpass your mass, light year pass college 
Light the torch, young skin cause you're trippin' 
I'm serious. True black is the young man 
I rap 'till I'm dead, and still have the upper hand 
Bring on the job cause the magic is hard 
Back-up kids, or else I'll put your card 

Here it comes, hot dress hits the ozone 
Born negativity runs through homes 
Of the innocent maybe the guilty 
Temperature high, cause society built me 
Se here we go, the frown hits my brown skin 
Waiting for the chance to end all the sin 
I'm not a devil, but hell I'm raising 
Fools I'm chasing, ending invasions (what kind of invasion) 
Of the hatred, radical that made it 
The mission is hard, and alone I can't fade it

Elle faisait bander tous mes amis
Le début d'une grande aventure
Il faut laisser faire la nature
Mais l'aurais-je un peu négligée
Elle a fini par se tirer
Je me suis fait larguer mais j'ai pas de regrets
D'ailleurs il est trop tard, allez vas-y Guitare

J'avais trouvé un bon petit business
Qui me rapportait pas mal de monnaie
Toujours sans trop me casser les fesses
On est pas des forcenés
Un peu léger sur les horaires
Alors ça a tout foutu par terre
Je me suis fait virer mais j'ai pas de regrets
C'etait un petit boulot peinard, allez vas-y Guitare

J'avais la plus belle auto du quartier
Une ancienne Little Red Corvette
Le collector cabriolet
Avec un arbre à came en fête
C'etait une très jolie voiture
Elle et moi, on avait fière allure
On s'est fait cartonner mais j'ai pas de regrets
C'est juste un peu dommage, allez vas-y Guitare

J'avais le tout meilleur copain du coin
Lui et moi comme les deux doigts d'la main
On en a fait des vertes et des pas mures
Qu'est-ce qu'on s'est marrés, je vous assure
Et puis un jour, partis en vrille
Fâchés pour une pécadille
Jamais réconciliés mais j'ai pas de regrets
C'est juste un peu bizarre, allez vas-y Guitare

J'avais la plus belle guitare du monde
La même Gibson que John Lee Hooker
Une cinquante neuf trouvée à Londres
Elle m'a frappé direct au cur
C'est une guitare à six coups
Je l'ai toujours autour du cou

En el auto de papá no vamos a pasear. 

Y bajo a mil por el camino del deshielo
Sin luces y sin frenos, a mi lado el precipicio
A mi lado el precipicio
A mi lado el precipicio

Y bajo a mil... 

Y ya nada importa que me haga torta
Tengo un rayo en mi cráneo
Que me parte en dos
Un rayo de montaña y cielo negro
Y una ruta agrietada del mismo frío

And in her eyes the look I saw was filled with gloom
Is this the question I would answer all too soon?
Come tell your friend what's wrong with you

Why don't you call me your baby anymore?
Am I so changed from some strange that went before?
Is this the change of mind that I've been designed for?
Why not your baby anymore?

Those words we spoke, they only seem to block our way
The truth rang out when you called me and called my name
I don't know what I can do or I can say
Your good friends also find a way

Why don't you call me your baby anymore?
Am I so changed from some strange love that went before?
Is this the change of mind that I've been designed for?
Why not your baby anymore?"

if the deal is right then respect is where it should be.

For the fakes and frauds it's a fucking fashion show
total compromise will have them sell their soul.
all the negative all the useless influence
all the emptiness all the violent detriment
makes no sense...

Please have more to give than fashion and images
please have more to give than fashion and images

Caught up in a trap of media crap that's no way to live
Caught up in a trap of media crap so little to give
Caught up in a trap of media crap that's no way to live

We watch the fashion trends,
We laugh and joke with friends,

To get myself together
And go on from here

Now I know better
It's time to move on

Just move on, don't ever stop"

My celebratin's gratin' on you
If you feel that way if it'll make you stay
Well here's what I'm gonna do

If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl
You'll see how low a man can go
When his back's against the wall
I'll be grovelin' in the gravel
If you make that taxi call
If you're gonna walk, I'm gonna crawl

You're a one man pure gold genuine good ol' girl
You've been waitin' on me to get tired of my neon world
Now the turn you've taken has got me shakin'
It's a heart breakin' wake up call
Now I'm seein' how you see me
And I feel about shoe top tall

Jesus on the cross weathered the storm of all mankind's sins. 
He stood alone as a gift of love to the world.
""There you stand, arms out and wide Like forbidden fruit to the squinting eyes 
Gather us together under your almighty wings 
Bruise the head and see what tomorrow brings Hand to the plow, forgiving multitudes 
Give them compassion, why are they afraid of you 
Proud at the altar, vain before the throne If you are blameless throw the stone 
Scarecrow all alone Scarecrow bring your children home 
Betrayed by a friend, hung out to dry 
Alone in the end, stretched across the sky 
Eclipse the sun, they know not what they do 
They say if God is love why would He be so cruel"

Verse 1: (andre 3000)
A nigga ready from the get go
y'all hear my shit go, it's andre, can you punk ass come out to play
stay in your little hole, then coward tuck your head
you dont know who you be fucking with yous better off...dead
is what I say, best run the other way
in case of physical breakdown...y'all can break now
my kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp make yourself exempt
pussy footin' around dont be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
nowhere to duck, bullets flying, niggas dying
by getting blasted, how drastic
they got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do 
but naw (naw naw), I take that back, that's my problem
turnin' and walkin' away just ain't gon' work when they be robbin'
as long as big boi's still livin', never standin' by my lonesome
step up nigga if you want some

Chorus x2: ain't no thang but a chicken wang
we havin' a smoke out in the dungeon with the mary jane
it's just the pimps, players, mack daddies, east point 
it's all about that sess in your chest, it's the joint

Verse 2: (big boi)
well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
it's that nigga down in the dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause
it's the original ghetto bastard, so now I make a switch
used to sell dope, but in 1994 I'm makin' southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
but see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
about the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
she had me makin' better grades to make a better life
but I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix, yea
it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
so if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal 
just an international playa coming through your stereo

(chorus)

Verse 3: (andre 3000)
3-5-7 to your forehead, they'll be mo' dead, 'cause I'm a pro kid
but lord forgive me, I got to keep my milli right be near me
my nine be doin' fine until these niggas wants to clear me off my street
but in my hood hood, they hollerin' ghetto
dont got no neighbours, they hit the pipe and never let go
but I feel for them like chaka khan feel for you
ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
on the concrete, remember when we ran deep
remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
they know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
trippin' with the drama, my beretta's right beside me
one is in the air and one is in the chamber
y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doin', I'm releasing anger
quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day at a time
I got the fattest dimes around my way, you can sway with andre
I'll take it to the ho-jo, bitch, just to let you know

Verse 4: (big boi)
it's on my friend, on the road again
I'm travelin' doing more than 65 on 85 off my cadillac
I got that nigga dre, he ridin' shotgun, and got my pump under my seat
in case these youngstas wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to bustin' caps with this here heat heater
load in clip up after clip I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
the glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
see I be bustin' caps like my amp be bustin' speakers
so how do you figure that big boi be sceard to blast ya
you supposed to be quickest draw, but man, well hell, I'm faster
uh, 1-2-3, you need to think about the future
before I shoot ya ass and dilute your blood with lead
from my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
you fucking slave, you better try another way, to take me out
it's truly somethin' difficult, dont even run upon me
unless you want your brain broke 
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'm a kick you in yo' ass and yo' nigga getting pistol whipped
you know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

He was a juvenile delinquent
He had his picture
On the wall of every precinct
He had a rep for hangin' out with his homies
Puffin' on the blunts
And sippin' on the 40's
But when he spoke
Nobody would listen
And when he was home
His parents, they would diss him They called him a bum
A worthless piece of shit
So over this he had a fit
And now he grabs his bag
And heads for the door
And walks to the neighborhood
Liquor store
Pulls out a gat
And tells the old man, ""Hit the floor""
Then breaks open his register drawer
Pulls out the money
Stuffs it in his pocket
Points his pistol
Then he starts to cock it
The man panicks and the gun goes off
Stupid old fool
Made Johnny blow his head off
But he don't care
'Cause he was taught
It ain't a crime
If ya don't get caught

Chorus(3x)
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
That's how it is homie like it or not

Now, comin' out of the store
Johnny shot two acpedic Jews
When he got home
His face was on the news
His mom freaked out
Told him, ""Get the fuck out""
That's when the pigs rolled up
So, yo he ducked out
He hit the back door
Like his name was Carl Lewis
Dipped to the pay phone
To find out where his crew is
He called up his home boy Jose[word up]
""Can I come over, my man?""
He said, ""No way!""
The cop- was here
He was lookin' all over for ya
But I told the pig
I didn't know ya
He said, ""Cool,
Pick me up at the school
I need a ride 'cause
I'm wanted for homicide""
Johnny's got his gun
And he's on the run
But he don't care
To him, the shit's fun
Now that he's an outlaw
Sorta like Robin Hood
The hard-rock hero
Of the whole neighborhood
If they catch him
He'll wind up in court, but
It ain't a crime if ya don't get caught[ha ha]

Fear of sin 
Judgement day's begun 

Death rising in the sky, warfare destroying millions of lives 
Environmental overkill, toxic waste overflowing landfills 
Starving nations hunger across the land, aids limiting lifespan 
Watch out, soon you'll see it's time to meet your destiny 

Fear of god 
The time has come 
Fear of sin 
Judgement day's begun 

Devastation now coming forth, the time has come to meet our fate 
The freedom of choice which has put us in this state of pain

Things that remind him: 'Life has been good'
Twenty-five years

He's worked at the paper
A man's here to take him downstairs
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones
It's time

There was no party, there were no songs
'Cause today's just a day like the day that he started
No one is left here that knows his first name
And life barrels on like a runaway train
Where the passengers change

They don't change anything
You get off; someone else can get on
And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones
It's time

Streetlight shines through the shades
Casting lines on the floor, and lines on his face
He reflects on the day

Fred gets his paints out and goes to the basement
Projecting some slides onto a plain white
Canvas and traces it
Fills in the spaces

He turns off the slides, and it doesn't look right
Yeah, and all of these bastards
Have taken his place
He's forgotten but not yet gone

And I'm sorry, Mr. Jones

Stories on my body, always comin' true 

You ask if I'm insane, pictures of pain 
Your stare I wear 
You ask what they mean, they seem obsene 
So unclean 

Sit a while and watch my friend 
Tell a story or two within my skin 

A thousand times the need I did undergo, head to toe 
My flesh has made an outcast of me, my strife, scarred for life 

Sit down children, as my life unfolds 
My body moves cold 

Illustrations on me, animation on you 
Stories on my body, always comin' true"
228,STEVE CAMP,Shade For The Children,TRFDIWZ128F1487121,1994,"You came into our home one spring
A helpless bundle of joy
Oh, the innocence a young one brings
Love employs
There's a tenderness in your heart
Your mother's sweetness in your soul
And a fire from your father
To burn against the cold

Ah, the first time you called me daddy
My heart leaped through the sky
Then I was struck by the reality
Of what lay before my eyes
Oh, Lord, I cried, I wanna be...

Shade for the children
A shelter from the storm
To be a place where they can grow
In the ways of the Lord
To train up my child
To live a pure and godly life
Through the struggles and fears
Dreams and tears of every day
To be shade for the children

Unless the Lord builds the house
Oh, we'll labor in vain
Oh, it's good to be under construction
Under His name
Like mighty warriors
A quiver is full of them
Like an arrow they will go
Where we have never been

As for me and my house
We'll serve the Lord each day
We'll draw our strength from Him
As we make our way
Oh, Lord, we pray, let us be...

Shade for the children
A shelter from the storm
To be a place where they can grow
In the ways of the Lord
To train up my child
To live a pure and godly life
Through the struggles and fears
Dreams and tears of every day
To be shade for the children

And if you ever stray
Know that we have prayed
The Lord would bring you home
And with every step you take
You'll someday discover
You were never alone
And when you have grown
I pray you'll be...

Shade for the children
A shelter from the storm
To be a place where they can grow
In the ways of the Lord
To train up my child
To live a pure and godly life
Through the struggles and fears
Dreams and tears of every day
To be shade for the children

Pray you'll be a shade
For the children, for the children

(Lord, let us be shade for the children)
I wanna be
(Lord, let us be shade for the children)
This is our prayer
(Lord, let us be shade for the children)
Every day, every day
(Shade for the children)
(Lord, let us be shade for the children)
I wanna be, need to be
(Lord, let us be shade for the children)
Help me to be"

And look in your eyes
For that old familiar flame
That love that burns
Makes my wolrd turn
Two hearts beating the same
Is it all in my mind
Or is it harder to find
I feel like I'm in the dark
I thought it was real
But I'm starting to feel
Like it must be all in my heart

I'm a fool for believing
But I just keep dreaming
While we just keep drifting apart
Trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart

I keep telling myself
There's something else
I could do
To find that spark
But wherever it lies
It's not in your eyes
I guess it's all in my heart

I'm a fool for believing
But I just keep dreaming
While we just keep drifting apart
Trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart
Just trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart"

All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother

Oh, I’ve been insane
And I won’t ever be the same

And then I rise
Here’s an ill kid pimpin’ 'cause he is so slick
Steps from darkness, his body electric
A drone buzzes the air, a cracklin’ tone
Then boomin’ like thunder in a cosmic jungle

Words that will wobble awkwards and evil

From the abyss, a fresh eternal alien
Now famished from pathless ways, I’ma do damage
To the wack MCs, I know you can’t stand this
Right about now, get down, I’m the annihilator
Rockin’ with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

Happy golden days of yore

Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little christmas now

San francisco is a cold place
To have a run of bad luck
People like to shine their little flashlights in your face

I'm glad you went back

The blue blue sky is made of butcher knives
And everyone you meet is wearing some stupid disguise
In columbus there's not spotlight to dazzle your eyes
I hope you find someone who loves you

My space is off limits until we move!
You understand that!

Do you expect me to chill while ou're bumrushin
You thought we were the passive kind well yo're mistakin'
You outta give nuff respect like I'm Jamaican
The point is I feel you endanger my pride
Your racist comments, yhour racist approach I aint with...
It's bad enough there's kids in there that are strugglin
Finding themselves with out you bringin' racism!
Just to bring peace do I have to get a piece?
And in the break of dawn I guess I'll pray 2 the east
Cuz I'm not the one to get slapped on the cheek
Without my fist curling up to hit you back in yo teeth! Yo

So void of life - one with the promised swarm

Let me dive into the lake
Where winter hides the snow
Then comes the summertime
Fields of scarlet poppies grow
Take me back where I see butterflies to-ing and fro-ing

And the river flows
I am never gonna take it back again
And the river flows
I am never gonna get it back again

We don't know anything
Trapped in a world full of strangers
Please don't tell me anything
I'd rather fall into you

Let me sleep a little while
Underneath the trees (There's a house in the tree by the lake)
And dream of dragonflies
Where the weary willow weeps for me
Take me back where I see dandelions blowing

And the river flows

quando gioco a fare il batterista di trash

che non son capace neanche di parlare
di quegli argomenti da laureati
di cui parlan sempre tutti i tuoi amici sfigati
Non me la menare
non capisco cosa vuoi
tanto lo sapevi
che non ero come voi
a me piacciono le birre scure
e le moto da James Dean
non quelle stronzate
che si dicono nei film
Tu che mi vorresti sempre in giacca e cravatta
io che metto sempre su la stessa maglietta
quella nera con i buchi sotto le ascelle
più diventan vecchie più mi sembrano belle
tu mi dici sempre che mi devo abbronzare
anche se sai che io odio il mare
dici che io non sono male ma
dovrei cambiare un po'¿ma vuoi capirla o no?
Non me la menare
Tu se lo sai mi devi dire se tu
Veramente mi preferiresti se
Io fossi uno di quegli stronzi
Vestiti a festa che si vedono
Dovunque vai nei bar oppure
In discoteca appoggiati a qualche colonna
Che bevono un gin tonic come fosse
Una bella storia, dai'ma vuoi capirla o no?
Non me la menare
Tu t'incazzi perché parlo sempre di calcio
dici che fra un po' ti verrà il fegato marcio
perché non ti parlo di tramonti lontani
e mangio la pizza solo con le mani
io che mangio quasi solo cose piccanti
tu che dici è meglio che ti lavi un po' i denti
io quando esco sono una bomba
che esplode e che fa boom¿ma vuoi capirla o no?

Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden till it's light
Streets get full up every night
With people buzzing round the lights
And waving at the taxis driving by

Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Watch the morning chase the night
Rolling home it's getting light
Feeling sleepy full of wine
Fall in bed just in time

The perfect stare of perfect eyes
That kiss you as they tell you lies
And wonder where you're going where've you been
In towers high with time to fill
Gardens on your window sill
In between the pavement and the sky

Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Tell me why 
All the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind
I've been driving through the danger signs

A perfect day a perfect night
Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden till it's light
Perfect silence me and you
It's really me I really do
Remember every moment magnified

Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's todays just fade away
Tell me why
All the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind
I've been driving through the danger signs"
250,Skrew,Skrew Saves,TRUAKIC128F934CA37,1994,"I'm eating the dirt from under your fingernails
I'm sucking the spit off the lips of your face
I'll bite the disease from your broken body
I'll eat the anger out of your heart

And I'll drink the shame that weighs down your dirty soul
I'll make you free, give you wings to fly
Clear your clouded vision so you can see
Crawl up on the cross, take the nail for you

Rest your troubled mind throw your worries away
Looking for a saviour I'm here to save your day
Might not be what you thought I'd be
I'm a soiled lamb with a taste for the whip
Not a self-righteous cash fiend on a martyr trip
Save your prayers shut your mouth and give me some lip

Open your eyes
Down on your knees
Hold on tight
Just say please

I'm eating the dirt from under your fingernails
I'm sucking the spit off the lips of your face
I'll bite the disease from your broken body
I'll eat the anger out of your aching heart

And I'll drink the shame that weighs down your dirty soul
I'll make you free, give you wings to fly
Clear your clouded vision so you can see
Crawl up on the cross, take the nail for you

Don't treat me f**king royal
I'm not wearing no crown of thorns
I'm gonna save ya honey 'til Gabriel blows his horn
Now blow motherf**ker!

This ain't the second coming or the third or the first
I'll be coming baby 'til I quench your thirst

Open your eyes
Down on your knees
Hold on tight
Just say please

I'm eating the dirt from under your fingernails
I'm sucking the spit off the lips of your face
I'll bite the disease from your broken body
I'll eat the anger out of your aching heart

And I'll drink the shame that weighs down your dirty soul
I'll make you free, give you wings to fly
Clear your clouded vision so you can see
Crawl up on the cross, take the nail for you"
251,Pulp,Pink Glove,TRCFFQU128C71965B1,1994,"You better watch what you're wearing
If you want him to come round and see you tonight
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh
But he doesn't care what it looks like
Just as long it's pink and it's tight
It's what he likes
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh

Oooh
So what should you do
Should you stop being you
Just to be how he wants you?
Oooh
Go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come
And meet me in the afternoon
Oooh
He's got your heart
You got his soul
You might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
But do you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time?
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time
Get it right first time

And now you've done once, now he wants you
To wear your pink glove all the time
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh

Oooh
So what should you do
Should you stop being you
Just to be how he wants you?
Oooh
Go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come
And meet me in the afternoon
Oooh
He's got your heart
You got his soul
You might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
Until you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time
You get it right first time

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh you'll always be together
'Cause he gets you up in leather
And you know what to wear at the end of the day
And I'd laugh if I saw that I'm out of the way
Yeah it's too long ago, shouldn't care anymore
But I wanted to know, is it as good as before?
Yeah it's hard to believe that you go for that stuff, all those
Baby-doll nighties, synthetic fluff
Oh it looks pretty good, yeah it fits you okay, yeah
Wear your pink glove, babe
You put it on the wrong way!

Oh, so
I know you're never gonna be with me
Until you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time, yeah
Oh, I know that you'll never leave him
Ooh ooh ooh, oh, but d'you see yet?
You got it right first time
Get it right first time"
252,Satanic Surfers,Egocentric,TRIBCCC128F9330C84,1994,"May I say what of you now
Do you mind
Why must I listen to you all the time
I'm not your toy
I am not you
And I will never be
I don't want your opinion
Don't want you around
Is it so hard to see
Why do you believe that you know everything
Why do you think that you're always right and never wrong

You wanted all
Wanted more
Wanter everything I couldn't give you"
253,Irene Grandi,Vai Vai Vai,TRDHXXQ128F423DCCA,1994,"E' l' amore che mi prende e mi porta via
E allora io non so piu' cosa fare
Passo le sere a sperare che qualcuno
Ma cosa dico qualcuno!Sei tu che ora voglio sentire
E ora magari viaggi,dormi,mangi,sogni,pensi
Forse a me boh!
E poi non e' mica detto che le cose vadano sempre bene
Questo io lo so
Ci abbracceremo ancora come quella sera
Ma giuro che se chiami ora...chiama ora

Cercavi me come stai?
C'e' gente con te,puoi parlare oppure no
Cercavi me piu' che mai
Voglio crederti un po', crederti un po,
Cresce l'amore perche'
Sai parlare di me, come inventi le parole
Fiori d'amore lo so
Che sei piu' bravo di me e allora

VAI VAI VAI e non fermarti mai
VAI VAI VAI e non fermarti mai
Vedo correre sul filo parole per me
VAI VAI VAI e non fermarti mai
VAI VAI VAI e non fermarti mai"

Say there are always two sides of every story
Here's mine, I found out
I cannot live without you )

Loving you was easy,
And being tru was hard,
One too many lies and you were gone
I didn't wanna face up to the things I've done
I thought I'ld be alright but I was wrong

I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

Saying that I'm sorry isn't good enough
I need to show you just how much I've changed
'Cause girl if you could see what I'm going through
You wouldn't be afraid to try again

I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say"
