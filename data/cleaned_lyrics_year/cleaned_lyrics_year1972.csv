0,Emerson_ Lake & Palmer,The Endless Enigma (Part 2),TRIZJKR128F92F9A12,1972,"Why do you stare?
Do you think that I care?
You've been misled
By the thoughts in your head

Your words waste and decay
Nothing you say
Reaches my ears anyway
You never spoke a word of truth

Why do you think
I believe what you said?
Few of your words
Ever enter my head

I'm tired of hypocrite freaks
With tongues in their cheeks
Turning their eyes as they speak
They make me sick and tired

Are you confused
To the point in your mind?
Though you're blind
Can't you see you're wrong?
Won't you refuse
To be used
Even though you may know
I can see you're wrong?
Please, please, please open their eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

I ruled all of the earth
Witnessed my birth
Cried at the sight of a man
And still I don't know who I am

Are you confused
To the point in your mind?
Though you're blind
Can't you see you're wrong?
Won't you refuse
To be used
Even though you may know
I can see you're wrong?
Please, please, please open their eyes
Please, please, please don't give me lies

I've seen paupers as kings
Puppets on strings
Dance for the children who stare
You must have seen them everywhere"
1,Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons,The Night,TRWFBPJ128F9351DC0,1972,"Beware of his promise
Believe what I say
Before the night is ending
Be sure of what you're saying

Cause he paints a pretty picture
And he tells you that he loves you
And he covers you with roses
And he always keeps you dreaming
If he always keeps you dreaming
You won't have a lonely hour
If the day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Oh yeah the night begins to turn your head around

Beware of his promise
Believe what I say
Before I go forever
Be sure of what you're saying

Cause the words might come too quickly
If you really think I'm leaving
And goodbye might come too easy
If you really think he loves you
If you really think he loves you
You would give yourself completely
If the day could last forever
You would give yourself completely

But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Oh yeah the night begins to turn your head around

(????)
And the night begins to turn your head around
Oh yeah you know you're gonna lose more than you found
Ma ma ma ma oh the night begins to turn your head around
Yeah yeah yeah yeah and you know you're gonna lose more than you found, oh"
2,Ry Cooder,Denomination Blues,TRCZYSZ128F933FDD2,1972,"(Washington Phillips) 

I wanna tell you people it's a nat'ral fact 
Ev'ry man don't understand the Bible alike
And that's all, I tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all 

Well, the denominations have the right to fight 
They ought go on and treat each other right 
And that's all, I tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all 

It's right to stand together, wrong to stand apart 
When none will enter heaven but the pure at heart 
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I'll tell you that's all 

Well, the primitive Baptists they believe 
That you can't go to heaven 'less you wash your feet 
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all 

Well, the African Methodists, they believe the same 
'Cause they know demonination ain't a thing but a name 
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all 

Well, people that jump from church to church 
You can bet their conversion don't amount too much 
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all 

Well, you can to your college, you can go to your school 
But if you ain't got Jesus, you'se (you are) an educated fool 
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all 
'Cause you better have Jesus 
I tell you that's all"
3,Atomic Rooster,Little Bit of Inner Air,TRBBMIF12903CA1EB0,1972,"Parnell

Voodoo power in the air
Mushroom's sticky sweet flower just siiting there
I gave some to my love and she lost all her hair
I aint got nothing to give now 'cept a little bit of inner air
Seven sunshine women in a bed
Imagaphonic idols and blow their heads
Black slipper crawled up thru' them but they just didn't care
'Cause I didn't have nothin' to offer them 'cept a little bit of inner air
Well I got somethin' ta say if you really want to get your way
Put voodoo in that dark red wine and this is what they'll say
They'll say really want for this and you tell 'em there's just a little bit of inner air"

It may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside (go outside) in the rain

Now I, I think I'm gonna cry
And I, I don't want you to see me cry

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts fallin'
On my face (on my face)
You won't see (you won't see, ah)
A single trace (a single trace)

But the tears I'm cryin' (I'm cryin')
Because of you I'm cryin' (because of you)
Don't want you to see me cry
Let me go, let me go, let me go

Once the sun comes out
And the rain is gone away

I know I'm gonna see
A better day

But right now I think I'm cryin' (I'm cryin')
Because of you I'm cryin' (because of you)
Don't want you to see me cry (I'm cryin')
Let me go, let me go, let me go

In the rain (in the rain)
It might sound crazy, but
It might sound crazy, but
But I wanna go outside in the rain

I said, it may sound crazy, but

Everybody's been there 
Everyone everyone 

Desolation angel 
On the cover of my paper 
Loves everyone everyone 

Rock on 
Rock on 

Mild mouthed Rita 
She's a Chevvy Chase cheetah 
Loves everyone everyone 

Teddy's going steady 
He's a silver-plated poet 
Loves everyone loves everyone 

Prophet pumped the car-scar 
Deeper only sweeter 
Loves everyone"
6,Sandy Denny,Bushes And Briars,TRAADUU128E0791BF5,1972,"I can't believe that it's so cold
And there ain't been no snow.
The sound of music it comes to me
From every place I go.
Sunday morning, there's no one in church
But the clergy's chosen man
And he is fine I won't worry about him
Got the book in his hand.
There's a bitter east wind and the fields are swaying
The crows are round their nests.
I wonder what he's in there saying
To all those souls at rest.
I see the path which led to the door
And the clergy's chosen man
Bushes and briars, you and I
Where do we stand?
I wonder if he knows I'm here
Watching the briars grow.
And all these people beneath my shoes,
I wonder if they know.
There was a time when every last one
Knew a clergy's chosen man
Where are they now? Thistles and thorns
Among the sand.
I can't believe that it's so cold
And there ain't been no snow.
The sound of music it comes to me
From every place I go.
Sunday morning, there's no one in church
But the clergy's chosen man
Bushes and briars, thistles and thorns
Upon the land."

10,Wishbone Ash,Blowin' Free,TRFIWVN128F1456BDE,1972,"I thought I had a girl
I know, because I seen her.
Her hair was golden brown
Blowin' free like a cornfield.

She was far away
I found it hard to reach her.
She told me ""You can try""
But it's impossible to find her.

In my dreams everything was alright.
In your schemes you can only try.

I know, because I seen her.
Her hair was golden brown
Blowin' free like a cornfield."

Je suis né dans le béton
Coincé entre deux maisons
Sans abri sans domicile
Comme un arbre dans la ville

Comme un arbre dans la ville
J'ai grandi loin des futaies
Où mes frères des forêts
Ont fondé une famille
Comme un arbre dans la ville

Entre béton et bitume
Pour pousser je me débats
Mais mes branches volent bas
Si près des autos qui fument
Entre béton et bitume

Comme un arbre dans la ville
J'ai la fumée des usines
Pour prison, et mes racines
On les recouvre de grilles
Comme un arbre dans la ville

Comme un arbre dans la ville
J'ai des chansons sur mes feuilles
Qui s'envoleront sous l'œil
De vos fenêtres serviles
Comme un arbre dans la ville

Entre béton et bitume
On m'arrachera des rues
Pour bâtir où j'ai vécu
Des parkings d'honneur posthume
Entre béton et bitume

Comme un arbre dans la ville
Ami, fais après ma mort
Barricades de mon corps
Et du feu de mes brindilles
Comme un arbre dans la ville"

I don't recall what happened yesterday
I don't remember what I did last night
All I know is I was feelin' all right

And we all had a real good time
Somebody told me I was outta my mind
But we all had a real good time
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine

Got so loud I couldn't hear the phone
Even if you tried to call, no one was home
The room was rockin' as I crawled across the floor
I tried to make it but I couldn't find the door

So we all had a real good time
Somebody told me I was outta my mind
But we all had a real good time
I couldn't stop myself from feelin' fine

Here we are now, the time is right
Feelin' good like I did last night
I can tell, that you're feelin' good, too
Come on with me I wanna party with you

And we'll all have a real good time
They tried to tell me I was outta my mind
But we'll all have a real good time
Don't try to stop yourself from feelin' fine

We'll all have a real good time
They tried to tell me I was out of my mind
But we'll all have a real good time
Don't try to stop yourself from feelin' fine"
16,Larry Norman,The Great American Novel,TRSLCOR128F9301FAB,1972,"I was born and raised an orphan
In a land that once was free
In a land that poured its love out on the moon
And I grew up in the shadows
Of your silos filled with grain
But you never helped to fill my empty spoon

And when I was ten you murdered law
With courtroom politics
And you learned to make a lie sound just like truth
But I know you better now
And I don't fall for all your tricks
And you've lost the one advantage of my youth

You kill a black man at midnight
Just for talking to your daughter
Then you make his wife your mistress
And you leave her without water
And the sheet you wear upon your face
Is the sheet your children sleep on
At every meal you say a prayer
You don't believe but still you keep on

And your money says in God we trust
But it's against the law to pray in school
You say we beat the Russians to the moon
And I say you starved your children to do it

You are far across the ocean
But the war is not your own
And while you're winning theirs
You're gonna lose the one at home
Do you really think the only way
To bring about the peace
Is to sacrifice your children
And kill all your enemies

The politicians all make speeches
While the news men all take notes
And they exaggerate the issues
As they shove them down our throats
Is it really up to them
Whether this country sinks or floats
Well I wonder who would lead us
If none of us would vote

Well my phone is tapped and my lips are chapped
From whispering through the fence
You know every move I make
Or is that just coincidence
Well you try to make my way of life
A little less like jail
If I promise to make tapes and slides
And send them through the mail

And your money says in God we trust
But it's against the law to pray in school
You say we beat the Russians to the moon
And I say you starved your children to do it
You say all men are equal all men are brothers
Then why are the rich more equal than others
Don't ask me for the answer I've only got one
That a man leaves his darkness when he follows the Son"
17,Procol Harum,Whisky Train,TRJYEUJ128F93005F1,1972,"Ain't gonna ride that whisky train
Ain't gonna burn up no more flame
Throw away my bottle down the drain
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train

To think that I could be so wrong
To be so sick and still go on
The way I drink it's been too long
Don't see much point in carrying on

I'm gonna lose these drinking blues
I'm gonna find a girl to make me choose
Between lovin' her and drinking booze
I'm gonna lose these drinking blues

Ain't gonna ride that whisky train
I'm tired of burning in the flame
Throw away my bottle down the drain
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train"

Who's right or wrong 
We've been injuring each other 
For much too long 
And it's too late to try to save 
What might have been 
It's over 
Nobody wins 

Make believin in forever 
Is just a lie 
And it seems a little sadder 
Each time we try 
'Cause it's a shame to make 
The same mistakes again 
And again 
It's over. 
Nobody wins 

We've gone too far too long 
Too far apart 
The lovin' was easy 
It's the livin' that's hard 
And there's no need to stay and see 
The way it ends 
It's over. 
Nobody wins"

Before she ever finds her goal
How many years must my heart be broken
Before you come home again
How many days must I stay here waiting
Why must I only touch you in my dreams
And how many nights must my eyes keep crying
Forever and ever it seems

With tender words you said you loved me
You said I touched you in your heart
But those were words to start a fire
Desire's gone without the spark
Chance's come but my love stays faithful
(Always) Trusting in one who caused me pain
How many years must my heart keep searching
To fall in love again

With tender words you said you loved me
You said I touched you in your heart
But those were words to start a fire
Desire's gone without the spark
Chance's come but my love stays faithful
(Always) Trusting in one who caused me pain
How many years must my heart keep searching
To fall in love again"
20,Thin Lizzy,Shades Of A Blue Orphanage,TREEHXX128F4273A9E,1972,"When we were kids he used to go over the back wall into old Dan's scrapyard
Into the snooker hall where most us kids were barred
An' into the Roxy and the Stella where film stars starred
That's where me and Hopalong an' Roy Rogers got drunk and jarred
And we might have been the saviour of the men,
the captured captain in the devil's demon den
And we might have been the magic politician in some kind of tricky position
Like an old, old, old master musician we kept on wishin'
We was headed for the number one hit country again

{Chorus}
And it's true
True blue
Irish blue
And it's true
True blue
And sometimes it reminds me of you

There's an old photograph of Dan that I wish you could-a seen
Of him and the boys posed, standing in St. Stephen's Green
Ya see, they were a part of the great freedom dream
But they were caught and detained and are locked inside the frame
of the photograph
And he might have been the clever con, the good samaritan, the rassclaut man
An' he might have been the loaded gun, the charlatan of the tap dancin' fan
But like an old pioneer from outer Afghanistan,
headed for the number one hit country again

{repeat chorus}

Old Dan in a raincoat hums the very, very, very special notes
of a long lost favorite melody
It reminds him of a love affair when he was young and did not care
And how he parted so soft, so sadden
And he might have been the laughing cavaliero, the wise old commanchero
Ow, the desparate desparado, the good looking Randolph Valentino,
the gigolo from Glasgow
But like an old, old hunter of the female buffalo,
he's headed for the number one hit country again

{repeat chorus}
And it's true
True blue
Irish blue
True blue
Irish blue
And it's true
It's so true
Ummm, it's true
I swear I've said it
Swear I've said it
I swear I said it
I swear it's true
And it's true
True blue
Oh, its Irish blue
And it's true..."
21,Cornelius Brothers & Sister Rose,Treat Her Like A Lady,TRNIRII128F146B090,1972,"All my friends had to ask me
Something they didn't understand
How I get all the women
In the palms of my hand

And I told them
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady and she'll give in to you
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

I know you've heard that a woman (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
Will soon take advantage of you (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
Let me tell you, my friend (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
There just ain't no substitute (treat her like, you got to treat her like)

So you ought to
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady and she'll give in to you
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

Oh, you got to love her (love her), tease her (tease her)
But most of all you got to please her (please her)
You got to hold her (hold her) and want her (want her)
And make her feel you'll always need her (need her)
You know a woman (woman) is sentimental (woman)
And so easy (woman) to upset (woman)
So make her feel (feel) that she's for real, yeah (real)
And she'll give you happiness, whoa

Strange as it seems (treat her like, you got to treat her like)
You know you can't treat a woman mean (treat her like, you got to treat her like)

So my friends, there you have it
I said it's the easy, simple way
If you fail to do this
Don't blame her if she looks my way

'Cause I'm gonna
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
So affectionately (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
I'm gonna treat her like a lady and she'll give in to me
Lord, look and see
You know what I mean

Oh, you gotta
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, you got to, got to treat her like)
Do the best you can do (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady"

Hace tiempo que vivo por ella
Y sólo sé que se llama Noelia
Noelia, Noelia, Noelia, Noelia, Noelia,

Yo quiero hablarle de mi amor
Pero ella da la espalda y se va.
Parece que me va a llamar
pero huye sin hablar.

Y sólo se que se llama Noelia.
Hace tiempo que vivo por ella
Y sólo sé que se llama Noelia

Hace tiempo que no he vuelto a verla
Y ya no sé qué será de Noelia.
Por la noche la busco en la playa
Y en silencio yo grito: ¡Noelia!

23,Larry Norman,Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music,TRQBWJD128F9301FB4,1972,"I want the people to know that he saved my soul
But I still like to listen to the radio.
They say rock 'n' roll is wrong, we'll give you one more chance.
I say I feel so good I gotta get up and dance.

I know what's right, I know what's wrong, I don't confuse it.
All I'm really trying to say
Is why should the devil have all the good music?
I feel good every day
'Cause Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away.

They say to cut my hair, they're driving me insane,
I grew it out long to make room for my brain.
But sometimes people don't understand,
What's a good boy doing in a rock 'n' roll band?

There's nothing wrong with playing blues licks,
But if you got a reason tell me to my face
Why should the devil have all the good music.
There's nothing wrong with what I play
'Cause Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away.

I ain't knocking the hymns,
Just give me a song that has a beat.
I ain't knocking the hymns,
Just give me a song that moves my feet.
I don't like none of those funeral marches
I ain't dead yet!

Jesus told the truth, Jesus showed the way
There's one more thing I'd like to say.
They nailed him to the cross, they laid him in the ground,
But they shoulda known you can't keep a good man down.

I feel good every day, I don't wanna lose it.
All I wanna, all I wanna know
Is why should the devil have all the good music.
I've been filled, I feel okay,
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues
Jesus is the rock and he rolled my blues away"

Shootin', cussin', killin', cryin', lyin'

No knocked on my brother Fred Hampton
Bullet holes all over the place
No knocked on my brother Michael Harris
And jammed a shotgun against his skull

Who's gonna protect me from you?

The nerve of you?

Your dead hands ending another freedom fan

Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around 
Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street 
Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played 
Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around...no 

But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days, 
So nice to see you coming back in this town again 
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea 
In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again... 

Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man 
Came down on day when no-one was looking and it 
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands 
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells 
And nobody...helping no-one else 
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why...no 

But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days, 
So nice to see you coming back in this town again 
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through 
You'd better know what you're going through now 
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon 
That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything 
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking 
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance 
From the people you meet. Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes 
'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again. 
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost 
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost 
I want back, I want back 
Back to the time when the earth was green 
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean 
Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine...no."

Meet again.

A book upon a shelf
No one there to turn the page
You're left to read yourself
Alone to sit and wonder just how the story ends
Cause no-one ever told you child
You gotta be your own best friend

Sunny days cloudy days
Always seem the same
If love were made of clouds I
Almost wish that it would rain
Even when the skies are clear
The weather's always blue
Every day would be nice If I had
Someone I could come home to

Love is it really love at all
Or something that I heard love called
Something that I heard love called

Now life can sometimes slip away
And love can pass you by
If only it had been another place another time
Maybe there'll be someone who likes to see you smile
Who will want to stay with you
And be your friend for a little while
Then wake up in the morning
Feeling so alive
Something you can hold on to
Not a shadow by your side
I guess that there'll be time to talk
Of things that we've been through
That special time when all is real
To feel reborn when love is new

Love is it really love at all
Or something that I heard love called
Something that I heard love called

Then sundown comes around again
You find yourself alone
Wander through a sea of eyes but always on your own
Was it really all you thought that it was suppose to be
Or are you just another face
In someone's fading memory

Love is it really love at all
Or something that I heard love called
Something that I heard love called"

I'm working on a building of love
Gonna build it in the name of everyone

And gave my life a second look
It read ""Blessed be the poor""

We should love, love one another

I'm working on a building of love
Gonna build it in the name of everyone
I'm working on a building of love
Gonna build it in the name of everyone

Gonna be a shelter for everyone
Call it out across the nation
Gonna get together, it's a strong foundation

Do you recall that bank job in 1881?
We lit out 'cross the country, spent a whole year on the run
Not seeing where we went, just looking back the way we come
We didn't see the Sheriff sneak up on us from the front

Hey Barracuda Dan
He was a straight lawman
His teeth were a tombstone's span, no, no
One look and the badmen ran

We had to fight it out there though we knew it were no use
We both knew Barracuda and we knew we had to lose
But better dyin' Dan's way than dyin' in a noose
And swingin while the people cheered and jeered and spat abuse

You tried to rope his horse and I fired at his head
He caught the bullet in his teeth and spat it in my leg
And bit the lassoo through so's it was you that fell instead
Then Barracuda's face said ""hold it, one move and you're dead""

""Now even I can't do all that the law requires me to,""
Said Dan, ""I don't believe in hangin', here's what I'll do
I'll take your horses, cash and guns, the rest is up to you""

Until they sound just like a symphony

Send me hopes that can spin in my head

I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And let tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

You're not the one and only thing in my heart

But I know, I’ve been kinda jumpy lately, I just can’t get no sleep on that bed you made me send off for. Boy, them leather straps and them rubber bits that just keep danglin’ why they just keep diggin’ in my side. I just can’t get no sleep at all.
Geez, I know I won’t sleep good until you tell me one of your little stories again.
And those sheets Rusty, those sheets sure are cold when you first get in, oh boy.
You remember Marty Clemmon from on, on the dock scene? Well Marty, Marty and Frank came round the other day and they was just full of this Gay Front. They just wouldn’t stop talking about it. Well, what’s with this Gay Front? I mean I only just got the front painted up. Jesus, ain’t that gay enough?
Oh Rusty, I can’t figure out how to write to you.
I want you here so much, just close to me. Standing by my side, the way you always did. The way I knew you would.
And now people are staring at me Rusty. 
Maybe I should close this letter.

(Chant) 1, 2, 3, 4
Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust.
Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust, thrust it up there
Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust, I sure do honey.
Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust.
Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust.

Rusty, what’s goin’ on?

Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust.

Hi Bob.

Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust.

Champion thrust, woway

Oh Rusty fix your bustee, you know I get so lusty, champion thrust."

If I can pull myself up to the door

But I can't see you anymore

There's something I've just gotta tell you
There's something keeps bringing me down, you know
There's one thing more I've just gotta ask you once again now, baby
Won't you please let me go?

If I'm to meet my master
If I'm to rule my fate
You know it couldn't come any faster, babe
But see I know it's not too late

Time has not been good for us
No time has not been kind
We've done all that we could for us
More time won't change my mind

And when my life is over
And I'm walking out in the rain
Let me lie down in the clover
And look up to the sun again

It's not that I did not love you
But something kept bringing me down, you know
There's something that I've just gotta tell you once again now, baby
Let me go,

We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

Maybe you and I can't do great things

With big blue eyes and tiny feet
Her name is Rosabelle Malone
And she tips the scale at twenty stone.

Oh, gee, but ain't it grand to have a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug her, you don't know where you're at
You have to take a piece of chalk in your hand
And hug a ways and chalk a mark to see where you began

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-chalkin' and a-huggin' away
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other way over the mountain
Comin' around the other way

Oh Gee, it aint so grand to be a girl so big and fat
That when you go to hug me you donâ??t know where youâ??re at

I have to take a piece of chalk in my hand
And hug away and chalk a mark to see where I began

Now where is that chalk? Ah, here it is
Iâ??ll put one cross here, and another one here.

Darling.

Ah, but seriously you know that Iâ??m crazy about you,
and I mean all of you, every little bit.

We both feel weâ??re meant for each other.

Yet when we walk through the street people think
that Iâ??m out with my mother.

One day I was a-huggin' and a-chalkin' and a-beggin' her to be my bride
When I met another fella with some chalk in his hand
Comin' around the other side, It was Lou Praeger
Comin' around the other side."

Up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there
It's a deception
When will I ever learn?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly
How can they find me?
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black-footed crow

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And taunting with pictures of home

Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne?

I'm alone here
With emptiness, eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home"

Why couldn't they just let me be
Let me be, let me be, let me be

On the alley-back

From across the track

Who'll make all things fair
He lives outside

Runnin' through ma' bones

Painful rip
In my upper hip
I guess it's time
To take another trip

Don't care what nobody say
I got to take the pain away
It's getting worser day by day
And all my life has been this way
Can't reason with the pusherman
Finance is all that he understands

Un ""te quiero"", una caricia
Y un adiós
Es ligero equipaje
Para tan largo viaje.

Donde el sol cada mañana
Brille mas
Forjarán mi destino
Las piedras del camino
Lo que nos es querido
Siempre queda atrás.

Donde el cielo se une con el mar,
Lejos de aquí
Con mis manos y con tu amor
Lograré encontrar otra ilusión,

Tried to boogie in a honky-tonk
But my old guitar was out of tune
That's when they didn't like my music
So they tried to throw me out the room

I was living in a funky world
They were living in three four time
All my friends are into rock and roll
Or they ain't no friends of mine

To be certain of earning his (burnt out/word of? ) love
He won a place in history
And his name will live eternally

Lived the life of a movie star
And he waved to the people from a big black car
Down in a book with the greatest names
Was a lonely man growing tired of pain

Tell me a story minister
There ain't no time left to lose

Ten man tried in the dead of night
Was the great man's final words to write
In a room that was soft and red
The great man spoke outside my head

Tell me a story minister
There ain't no time left to lose"

Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She What did we do that was wrong
is having We didn't know it was wrong fun
Fun is the one thing that money can't buy
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, bye
She's leaving home. Bye, bye"

He's the hero, make that clear.
Does the same thing his father did,
Sailing around the Caribbean,
Robbing kings with his talking parrot,
This time I think he's on the high side.

Scabs are forming, scraped his knee.
Guards are warning, a bad man is free.
He's like electric clock that needs no winding,
Keeps the time without your hands.
Western feet need no binding,
Take a barefoot run through old Japan.

He's seen a thousand countries,
They're all the same.
Some men are crazy,
Some of them sane.
But all men are ruled by a flag or a game, 
And he knows nobody's got you if you don't sign your name.

Long John Silver serves no king.
No land holds him, that's why he feels like singing.
Every country now and then,
Roars like Irish, drunk and singing.
Every monk will now and then call his men to hear the wenches,
Night bells ringing."

Nevermore, never know
There, memories are sorrow
When there's no tomorrow

Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream
Sleep while you think of me with kindness
Please remember former days
Sweet the song that once we sang
The silent parting ways
And you know, and you know
And you know, long ago when first we made our promise
Empty words, I wonder, did you know?

The laugh that love could not forgive
Is gone and tells no more to live
And we who look in beauty's love
Must now, through all, look back on before

The tears that I first cried, no more
Your love has come and gone, no more
And we who look in beauty's love
Must now through all think back on before

Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream
Sleep while you think of me with kindness
Please remember former days
And you know, and you know

And you know, when we two parted in tears and silence
Past the days, the parting ways

Fare thee well, fare thee well, you that was once dear to me

Tu
questa sera stranamente su,
eccitata più che mai,
vuoi giocare con la verità
ma si gioca addosso a me;
ti confesso ciò che sai
è acqua antica e tu che fai,
ti alzi in piedi e te ne vai, così.
E pensa questo, amore mio,
questa serata l'ho voluta io,
questa allegria che mancava un po'
nelle sere in casa tra di noi.
La cosa che ti avrei detto poi
è che stasera, più che mai,
sentivo quanto eri grande tu
e quanto il resto non contasse più.
Io
so che a casa non ti troverò,
so persino dove sei
ma se aspetti che ti cerchi io
puoi morire insieme a lui;
mi hai soffiato in faccia addio
ma la notte è breve e poi
con dolcezza troverai, vedrai!
E pensa questo, amore mio,

The spirit is getting stronger.
You keep the dance halls humming
But the end of the age is coming.

I've searched all around the world to find a grain of truth.
I've opened the mouth of love and found a wisdom tooth.

Maybe you think I'm plastic,
But your situation's drastic.
I'm glad my faith is stronger,
This world won't last much longer.

I've searched all around the world to find a place of peace.
I've sat in the shade of God and watched the joy increase.

There's no time left for stalling,
Can't you hear someone calling?
Life all around is crumbling,
I think this world is stumbling.
Maybe you think I'm wrong, now
But this is my only song, now.

I've searched all around the world to find a grain of truth.

And he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt, and baggy pants
He did the old soft shoe
He jumped so high
You know he jumped so high
And then he lightly touched down

Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles
C’mon dance

I met him in a cell down in New Orleans, alright
I was down and out
He looked to me to be
The eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life
Yes, he talked of life
He laughed and slapped his leg a step

He said the name Bojangles
And then he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants a better stance
Oh, he jumped up high, high
He clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
You know he let go a laugh
He shook back his clothes all around

C’mon dance

[Spoken by David Bromberg, “This is really a true story, ya know. A lot of people had heard the song. And well, at least Jerry Jeff has told me it was a true story. I played guitar with Jerry Jeff Walker for about two years and we did this song every night for two years. And I never got tired of it. Jerry got a little tired of it. At night after the clubs closed we would do horrible things to it. It was a true story, he, this guy, Bojangles was a, he was a street dancer in New Orleans. What he do was go from bar to bar, and ah, he put-a, put money in the jukebox or get someone else to do it. And then he would either dance or pantomime the tune, right. And for that people would buy him drinks, get him pretty drunk, and then he would go onto the next bar and, the next one until it was closing time. And then he would do it the next night. And after a few night of this, he would end up on the corner and the cops would pick him up and take him to the drunk-tank; which is where Jerry Jeff met him. Ah, Jerry Jeff wasn’t there on a research project, I... I mean the way I got that story, I, I may have that wrong, but the way I got that was he propositioned the right woman, at the right time, in the wrong place. And her husband, the bartender… ah, called the cops and they, ah, they took Jerry, ah, to the parish jail. And he, he and this guy just talked for three days in the cell about, you know about what he does.”]

He said he danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years
How his dog and him
Traveled about
His dog up and died
You know his dog up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said, I dance now at every chance in honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time
I spend behind these county bars
‘Cause I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask please

Mister Bojangles

Mister Bojangles
C’mon

You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend, somehow.

Well, that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound

Can I find the doorway through which I must go?
Is the key to this plane too much for me to try to gain?
Is the passport to this world my astral soul?

Seven signs rode on seven stars
Seven ways to find the long lost bards
Seven days became seven years
While Pocus laughed and called foul jeers
Seven times he cursed seven tears
Each one became their seven fears
What is lost is never gained again
I've cast the spell that eternity chained
No more to cry o mortal soul
The astral path is now your fortuitous role

Lost am I in this world of timelessness and woe
Can I find the doorway through which I must go?

Is the passport to this world my astral soul?"

Morning's sleepy sky
With all the colours of the sunrise
Shining in our eyes

One, then another
With a story of yesterday's life
Or of a lover who had gone
In a moment of strife

No thought of sleep ever dwells upon
The wise man's mind
Some task or audience
Stealing every moment of his time

Thus we have learned to live
While mortal men stand waiting to die
How can we do what must be done
In just one short life

And if you ask, then you must know
If you still doubt, you should be told
It was not we that made it so
It was by those who went before

And there you sit, tomorrow's child
So full of love, so full of life
But you must rise to meet the day
Lest you become another tale
Another tale..."

Suitcase in my hand

Riding in a Stutz Bearcat Jim
Those were different times
And the poets studied rules of verse
And all the ladies rolled there eyes

Sweet Jane

Now Jack he is a banker
And Jane she is a clerk
And they're both saving up all their money
And when they come home from work

Sitting by the fire
Radios a-play
A little classical music for you kids
To the march of the wooden soldiers and you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
Other people they got to work
And there's always some evil mothers
I tell you life is just full of dirt

And the women never really faint
And the villains always blink their eyes
And children are the only ones that blush
And that life is just to die

But anyone who had a heart
He wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
He wouldn't want to turn around and hate it

You're just hanging by a thread, if she cuts it you will die

She's a kite woman, high flying woman
She's a kite woman
She's got you strung out somewhere down the line

Ain't no doubt about her style or her intentions
She looks farther away as she's reeling you in
It's nearly worth it, nearly worth the magic
Of that minute or two when you think you might win

She's a kite woman, high flying woman
She's a kite woman
She's got you strung out somewhere down the line
But you don't mind

God, I know how it feels coming down
It kinda makes you wonder if anybody knows you're still around

To part time sunshine, full time rain

But maybe the light will cease all your pain"

And in that land of make believe
Is where he'll leave her sleeping
Softly warm in a crystal lullaby

He's weaving her a paper castle
Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur
Welcome her into their world
That lives inside the dreams of every little girl

She's guarded by a brave tin soldier
Sitting on her shoulder
Taken there in a crystal lullaby

Sometimes when I listen to
The velvet song that fills a summer afternoon
Something deep within me sighs
And wishes for the peaceful skies of long ago

That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away
Leaving me and a crystal lullaby

That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away

And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies.

Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth
While you're in the stupor
The door knocks and death takes another youth.

Everybody feels alright you know
I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose

Tell me, how long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep,
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep,
B-B-B Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep"
138,Deep Purple,When A Blind Man Cries,TRHICCJ128F932F7EC,1972,"If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room
Had a good time but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul"
139,John David Souther,Jesus In 3/4 Time,TRLGADB128F92E9E4F,1972,"If I gave you my blessing, bid you goodnight
Something is holding me down
Once I was baptized, that was alright
Now if I just can be found

Living for Jesus, day after day
Nobody quite that strong

Blessed assurances is one thing to know
And another to sing in a song
Well, the family possessions passed on to me
No longer fit in my hand

Once I was saved, that one was free
I'd been pleased to know just where I stand

Living for Jesus, making it pay
Well, I know God lives quite that long

Once I was baptized, now I am free
To sing you a new gospel song

Singing higher, higher, higher
Singing higher, higher, higher
Singing higher, higher, higher, higher"

I might try to indicate my state of mind
or turn you on
or tell you that I’m laughin’
just to keep from cryin’
pretty music, when you hear it,
keep on tryin’ to get near it
a little rhythm for your spirit
but that’s what it’s for
c’mon in here’s the door

I’ve seen a sparrow get high
and waste his time in the sky
he thinks it’s easy to fly
he’s just little bit freer than I

Now here’s a mystery
maybe you can help to make it clear to me
When you’re fast asleep
and than what is that’s lightin’ up the dreams you see
all your tears can’t conceal it
all your prayers may not reveal it
you got soul so you can feel it
and when you make the scene
then you’ll know what I mean

I’ve seen a sparrow get high
and waste his time in the sky
he thinks it’s easy to fly
he’s just little bit freer than I

Down here on the ground
when you fine folks are givin’ you the runarround
keep your game up up-tight
and if you must just take your secrets underground
now, politicians try to speech you
mad color watchers try to teach you
very few will really try to reach you
if you’re lost in the stack
that’s ok come on black

Now I'd be the last to deny
that I'm just an average guy
and don't you know each little bird in the sky
Is just a little bit freer than I

Ordinary Joe, people say you’re just a lazy so and so
what they think is real
is nothing but an animated puppet show

So don’t let time and space confuse you
don’t let name and form abuse you
let Big Joe Williams blues you
in the light of the sun you can see how they run"

How to go my own separate way
It's a shame to think about yesterday a shame
We've been running round in our present state
Hoping help will come from above
But even angels there make the same mistakes in love

Now that we are lonely
Life seems to get hard
Alone what a word lonely
Alone it makes me cry

Wheels in and around
Express our emotion
Tracks up then it cracks down"

Spends his life denying that 
He's got no time for flying 
In the breeze 
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone 
And he is free 
Earlybird is scratching though 
The going's getting tough 
Time is passing by him and he just 
Can't get enough 
He'll tell you all is well when 
All is really going wrong 
The Earlybird will wake one day 
And find his life is gone 
You know I like to lay in bed 
And sleep out in the sun 
Reading books and playing crazy music 
Just for fun 
You know it makes feel so fine 
And puts my mind at ease to 
Know that I don't harm a soul 
In doing what I please 
Aaahhhh, ahhhh , ahhhhh ahhh...

And maybe you'll make it to the top

And I can tell you 'cos I know

And who says the hunt has begun?

perché io amo la vita,
perché io piango, perché io rido

But then you went away and left me by myself,
I feel completely lost and lonely without you.

Why'd you go, baby? I guess you know,
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you, without you.

Today I thought I saw you walking down the street
With someone else, I turned my head and faced the wall.
I started crying and my heart fell to my feet
But when I looked again it wasn't you at all.

Why'd you go, baby? I guess you know,
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you, without you.
It's just no good without you, without you.
It's just no good without you, without you.
It's just no good without you.

I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you.

""It's time"", you said, or is it time you went
I tried so hard to leave you
I tried to sleep
The hours you keep
Oh Lord I wish I could escape this iron veil

Ride on my son
Ride on my son
Ride until you fail

Something comes and something goes
And something dies before it grows
And I'm like a sea diver
Who's lost in space
""Sweet"", said His Grace
Oh Lord I wish I could escape this iron veil

Ride on my son
Right on my son
Ride until you fail"

Flashed those big brown eyes my way,
And ooh, I wanted you forevermore.
I'm not one that gets around,
Swear my feet stuck to the ground,
And though I never did meet you before.

I said, ""Hello, Mary Lou,
Goodbye, heart.
Sweet Mary Lou,
I'm so in love with you.
I knew, Mary Lou,
We'd never part.
So hello, Mary Lou,
Goodbye, heart.""

Saw your lips; I heard your voice.
Believe me, I just had no choice,
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away.
Thought about a moonlit night,
My arms around you good an' tight,
That's all I had to see for me to say.

""Hey, hey, hello, Mary Lou,
Goodbye, heart.

A te che sei il mio presente

lascian fredda la mia mano e più in là 
un canto di fagiano sale ad est

smarrirmi in questo bosco volli io 
per leggere in silenzio un libro scritto ad est 
Le mani rosse un poco ruvide 
la mia bocca nell'abbraccio cercano 
il seno bianco e morbido tra noi 
Dimmi perché ridi amore mio 
proprio così buffo sono io 
la sua risposta dolce non seppi mai!

From the album SUMMER BREEZE (1972). 

See the funny little man, huffing and puffing and digging the sand.
In his search for something to build, perhaps a church on the side of a hill.
Little does he know that he's working in vain. 
When rain comes the hill will come sliding down and will not hold.

See the funny little man, running and hiding and flailing his hands.
Asking himself what could have gone wrong, for he has worked hard the whole day long.

See the funny little man, small in his size when compared to the land.
When will he grow up, can time wait until
The funny little man can see beyond the hill."

Around the world and back again
A heart as light as wings
Made of sky, made of wind and things
She keeps things you don't know
She shows things you don't show
She never wants to see you alone

Something in her smile
Tells you she will stay awhile
Something in her style
Shines and sets the sun on fire
Every time she's near
Is like music to your ears
Before you rise she waits
Inside your eyes

Chorus:
If she were to say those words
Would you understand
Wouldn't it be easier
To let her take your hand
Love's the song I sing
Song to Florentine

Florentine she leaves
A trail of misty make-believe
You know she holds the key
And you follow her to mysteries
There's hidden things inside
She leaves for you to find
To unlock the road you must
Say please

Love's the song I sing
Song to Florentine
Love, love must be the song
Song to Florentine"

Don't it seem like the time goes on
And here we are still carrying on
Reaching out for one another
Like a telephone call 
from an old friend or a brother
And you are there to share this 
song in the making
Goodbye don't mean I'm gone

I know how alone you are
When it's so hard to be so far
From the ones who mean the most to you
WHen you would so much rather
have them close to you
I hope you know you haven't been forsaken
Goodbye don't mean i'm gone

I'll never be what you think you see in me
If I can help you deal with what you see as real
That makes me glad to have known you

Missing you the way I do
You know I'd like to see more of you
But it's all I can do to be a mother
My baby is in one hand,
I've a pen in the other
You know my love is always there for the taking
And goodbye don't mean I'm gone"

'Cause the streets are filled with bad goings-on
And you know that's no place to be

But my car broke down in the evening
You know it just stopped stone cold
Stopped stone cold in the street
And a dirty mean man with a shotgun in his hand
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""

Wasn't that strange
Wasn't that strange indeed
Wasn't that strange
Wasn't that strange indeed
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""

If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make clear to whomever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch 
At a church where people saying 
My God, that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining 

We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?

And in my hour of need
I truly am, indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Now, looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally 
Alone again, naturally"

The time of grace has come for which we have prayed
Let us devoutly sing songs of joy.

God is made man, while nature wonders
The world is renewed by Christ the King.

From where the light has risen (the East), salvation is found.

Therefore, let our assembly sing praises now at this time of purification
Let it bless the Lord: greetings to our King."

You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only coming along for the ride

Well you go your way I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something they say
I'll get my kicks on the way

Over the mountains across the sea
Who knows what may be waiting for me
I can sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change

All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the sea gulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I wanna tell you all I wanna say
Is count me in on the journey
Don't expect me to stay"

When the music is right and the band gets tight
You ought-a see 'em pick and grin

To the sound of the guitar strums
And everybody starts groovin'
To the beat of the rhythm and drums

Just sip that wine, have a really good time
And listen to a country song.

Old Sheriff Brown he never comes around
Knocking on the old back door.
As a matter of fact you can find him in the act
Pickin on the old banjo.

Tries to get to sister Sue.
Well she throws him on the ground without turning around
'Cause she knows a lotta jujitsu."

Ever so brightly alone

On the other side of the hill
Drifting on a golden wing, and I can't wait
To hear the smile
She can sing
Take me through the day
Take my breath away

And we ride the countryside
High and wide, and she brings
Crackers, cheese and wine
Oh, they're gonna bust my side
And she's got strawberries
Comin' by the dozen
Brown sugar and sweet cream
Set my mouth a-buzzin'

Take me down to the river blue
Throw a whisper to the wind that

And my love long locked inside itself
Had finally been set free

I can remember Autumm skies and goodbyes
Hurting so badly that I thought I would die

The more they stay the same
And the lonely ones get lonelier
With every passing day

From the day we met I knew that I should
Never let you
Get a hold on me 'cause noe you see I
Can't forget you
Oh I, I can remember midsummer skies
Love in your eyes

In the Spring, the sun will shine and make the
Ice surrender
But it will not warm my heart as long as
I remember
And I, I will remember midsummer skies
Love in your eyes
And I, I will remember the times I've cried
Since you say goodbye

I nearly died when you said,
""I, I can't let you down anymore
So I guess this goodbye""

Holdin' hands and skippin' stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doin' a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rockin' 'round the clock
We were hoppin' and boppin' to the Crocodile Rock, well

Crocodile rockin' is somethin' shockin', when your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will

Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights cryin' by the record machine
Dreamin' of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we got
Burnin' up to the crocodile rock
Learnin' fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the crocodile rock would last, well

Crocodile rockin' is somethin' shockin', when your feet just can't keep still

I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love on stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but, darling, can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darling, can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time

From the albums SUMMER BREEZE (1972), GREATEST HITS (1975), SUDAN VILLAGE (1976), 
THE SEALS &amp; CROFTS COLLECTION (1979) and LIFT UP YOUR VOICES AND SING, VOL. 2 (1997).

Go east of your dream and farm. Let peace and silence spin your yarn.
What harm can befall thee in yon wilderness of clove?
Go on east of ginger trees. Go soft and silent like the breeze.
With ease be off and wander in yon wilderness of clove.
Go on past the goldenrods, where fools and angels lose their odds.
And gods of our ancestors did immerse themselves in clove.
Go on toward the crimson shore, beyond this life of metaphors.
Where doors of understanding's house decorates he them with clove.

(From Baha'i scripture) ""Be lions roaring in the forests of knowledge,
Whales swimming in the oceans of life.""
Prepare to meet Bahá'u'llá'h in the Garden of Clove. 


Note: Vahid Odin Spencer provided me with the context of the closing lyric in October of 1999 -- 
O Lord! Should the breath of the Holy Spirit confirm the weakest of
creatures, he would attain all to which he aspireth and would
possess anything he desireth. Indeed, Thou hast assisted
Thy servants in the past and, though they were the
weakest of Thy creatures, the lowliest of Thy servants and the most
insignificant of those who lived upon the earth, through
Thy sanction and potency they took precedence over the most
glorious of Thy people and the most noble of mankind. Whereas
formerly they were as moths, they became as royal falcons, and
whereas before they were as brooks, they became as seas, through
Thy bestowal and Thy mercy. They became, through Thy
most great favor, stars shining on the horizon of guidance,
birds singing in the rose gardens of immortality, lions
roaring in the forests of knowledge and wisdom, and whales swimming in the oceans of life.

We really hit our target for tonight 
How we sing as we limp through the air 
Look below, there's our field over there

Impossible to number
Dressed in white
Carrying palms
Shouted amid
The hotless sun
The lightless moon
The windless earth
The colourless sky

Baby when you came my way I thought I'd found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life, surely took me by surprise

But now you gone and deserted me, can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm, ew yeah I just can't let it boy I
Looked around and all I could see, was water coming over me

All I do is cry, all I do is walk around and cry
But right now I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning in the sea of love

But that's alright, I don't mind drowning for your love
That's alright baby, hear me when I say it's alright

And I see the midnight flight 
Of a blackbird, through my vision

She is standing in the doorway 
With the love light in her eye 
And she beckons me to journey 
Through the night 
Through the night 

Listen to the blackbird sadly sing 
For you, for me 
Look at all the pointless suffering 
Humanity 

To the people, who are naked 
As they breathe in amber haze 
Wandering endlessly narcotic 
Through the maze 
Through the maze 

To the leaders, who are timeless 
As they flaunt their warlike ways 
Flying endlessly o'er the wasteland 
Seeking praise 
Seeking praise

Childhood themes of nights alone
Wipe away endless years
Childhood tears as dry as stone

From seeds of confusion
Illusions dark blossoms have grown

Decided by limits drawn 
On charts of my past ways 
And pathways since I was born

No matter who you're working for
But you'll find a way when the landlord's knocking on your door
But you won't be down until your mama's gone

So your morale is a let down
Don't put the blame upon yourself
You still hurry home 'til you know she's found nobody else
So you won't be down until your mama's gone

Allow me to show you the warning
I don't wanna see you lose
Don't carry on 'til the wild grass is growing round your shoes
For it won't be long until your mama's gone
Until your mama's gone

It's hard to get up in the morning
No matter who you're working for
But you'll find a way when the landlord's knocking on your door
Oh you won't be down until your mama's gone"

Where the lights are dim and true love is coming through
There's no one else in this whole world as far as we're concerned
We built ourselves a fire so let it burn
When you look at me like you do right now I go to pieces
Because I know what's on your mind it's just me
You've got that love-me-look in your eyes like you've had so many time and how
Loving you could never be better than it is right now

Tomorrow night we'll meet again to once more fan the flame 
Cause loving you the way I do stays the same
This love of ours is just as strong as any vow could be
And love could never be better for you and me
When you look at me...
Loving you could never be better than it is right now"

Pages of your book on fire
Read the writing, on the wall

Hoedown, it’s a showdown
Everywhere you look 
we're fighting, hear the call

And you know it’s gettin’ stronger,
It can't last very much longer
Turn to stone

Well there's a change in the wind
You know the signs don't lie
Such a strange feelin’ and I don't know why
Its takin' such a long time

Backyard people and they work all day
Tired of the speeches
And the way that the reasons keep changin'
Just to make the words rhyme

And you know it’s getting stronger,
Can't make ‘em learn much longer
Turn to stone

And you know it’s gettin’ stronger,
Can't last very much longer

Tears I can't hide 
Tears that I tried to keep 
Deep down inside 
Tears fall, a love that's gone 
Beyond re call 
And when I dim the lights in my room to night 
Teardrops will fall 

I'm gonna pray tonight, baby

Other bands are looking mean, me, I'm trying to stay clean.
I don't dig the radio, I hate what the charts pick
Rock and roll may not be dead, but it's getting sick.
All over the world disc jockeys sound the same
And every town I play is like the one from where I came.

The Rolling Stones are millionaires, flower children pallbearers,
Beatles said All you need is love, and then they broke up.
Jimi took an overdose, Janis followed so close,
The whole music scene and all the bands are pretty comatose.
This time last year, people didn't wanna hear.
They looked at Jesus from afar, this year he's a superstar.

Dear John, who's more popular now?
I've been listening to some of Paul's records.
Sometimes I think he really is dead.

It's 1973, I wonder who we're gonna see
Who's in power now? Think I'll turn on my TV,
The man on the news said China's gonna beat us,
We shot all our dreamers, there's no one left to lead us.
We need a solution, we need salvation,
Let's send some people to the moon and gather information.

They brought back a big bag of rocks.
Only cost thirteen billion. Must be nice rocks.

You think it's such a sad thing when you see a fallen king
Then you find out they're only princes to begin with
And everybody has to choose whether they will win or lose
Follow God or sing the blues, and who they're gonna sin with.
What a mess the world is in, I wonder who began it.
Don't ask me, I'm only visiting this planet"

Set me free, let me be, Tecolote

Drums keep beatin' in my head all night
Poltergeists knockin' on my left and right
Pain and a fever running 103
Just because her daughter wants to marry me

Rather die, rather die than get married
Let me go, tell her no, tell her no

You heard my story and you now know why
A strange old woman makes a grown man cry
And next time a pretty pretty  turns your head
You better take a look at her mother instead

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt and said

He said, yeah, yeah, lawd, sure would taste good

So they slipped on their rubber boots
And walked down to the water's edge
And right away they knew
That the night would be a bummer

'Cause Ira Lee stepped
On a water mossacin
He said, uh, uh, lawd
Somebody help me

Ira Lee turned to Roosevelt
When he quit his screamin' and kickin'
And he said, let's forget about the bullfrog legs

Solo guardo de ti
tu perfume, tu olor

ardía nuestro amor

Y aunque el fuego se apagó

Good old Farmer John took me on sowing seeds and picking weeds
I had to leave, said, I ain't the man you need

I don't know why I'm the way I am
All I seem to know is that I am
And if you offered me anything my soul desired
I'd choose the road and take the mystery

Mr Bunn the baker took me on, said I ought to make some bread
I had to leave, said, I ain't the man you need

Algernon the tailor took me on, said he had a job to suit
I had to leave, said, I ain't the man you need"

Get nothin' for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong

Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best, don't do it babe

Don't break my heart

My biggest mistake was lovin' you too much
And lettin' you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causin' me
Girl, I try to do my best
Girl, I try to do my best
Don't you do it, don't break my heart

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?

Berryl was stuck on the tube from Victoria
Cheryl and the rest had all found new boyfriends
The only one left was the one in his head
So he busies himself, quite amusing himself, by abusing himself

All of his life he had wanted one true love
One girl he could worship all day out all night in
Alas all the girls he had met in his short life
Were girls who always quite looked like his dad's wife
So he busied himself, quite amusing himself, by abusing himself

Oh dear what a pity, a pity, what a shame, oh what a shame
Girls on glossy paper, never quite the same, not quite the same
Always saying sorry, never quite the same, not quite the same

Sitting one evening wrapped up in TV
His doggy insists that he must find a tree so he
Puts on his coat and he searches around for a
Platinum lighter he dropped on the ground and he
Bruises himself, where he uses himself, for abusing himself

Out in the park he was walking his doggy
He saw a young lady who made him feel soggy
He spoke to her softly, she made not a sound then
He realized that his match he had found,
She was losing herself, quite amusing herself, by abusing herself"

Saw you in your red dress smile

Cette antienne virile
Qui retentit dans la guérite
De la vaillante sentinelle

Afin de tromper son cafard
De voir la vie moins terne
Tout en veillant sur sa lanterne
Chante ainsi le gardien de phare

Au refrain

Après la prière du soir
Comme il est un peu triste
Chante ainsi le séminariste
À genoux sur son reposoire

Au refrain

À l'Étoile où j'étais venu
Pour ranimer la flamme
J'entendis ému jusqu'aux larmes
La voix du soldat inconnu

Au refrain

Et je vais mettre un point final
À ce chant salutaire
En suggérant au solitaire
D'en faire un hymme national

At least ten times a day

To carry on this way

I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night
Wanting to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feeling just can't be right

That people won't do the things

Some folks say the world, it never gonna change
But in my heart I do believe 
Those are the folks who guide to
Can't or for not to

The day turns bright and night turns wonderful
Twilight never really brings into an end
If white is right and black is beautiful,
Lord, tell me when can brown begin
Tell me, people, when can brown begin

Fire and water won't be mixed in, so they say
But I've seen the steamclouds
Floating high and free
Salt and pepper don't get in each other's way
No, they just cooked together
And when they don't agree, they just let each other be

The day turns bright and night turns wonderful
Twilight never really brings into an end
If white is right and black is beautiful,

For the journey it's a nonstop
It's a date
Sweetheart don't be late 
Come, let me go, let me go to Tobago
That paradise, found by Robinson Crusoe
And it is said, it's the land of tomorrow
Princess Margaret say, come Tobago for holiday
Now the whole world say, come Tobago for holiday 
Your native friend surely would be a host
And show you some of the beauties from coast to coast
As you look down curiously at the gray sand and the blue sea
You'll agree, it's just heavenly 
For rare beauty, well, it's my belief
There is no other place like the Buccoo Reef
Where the fishes seems to gather
Just to welcome every stranger
It is grand
On this Crusoe land"
279,The Last Poets,Hands Off,TRUYDJL128F92E20BB,1972,"Tell me not that I'm a dreamer for the things I feel and see
or that nothing can be accomplished from the things I wish to be
Tell me not that I'm fanatic for the things I feel inside
they are flowers of oppression born of a pain I cannot hide
Do not look upon my actions as the acts of one insane
when I take up modern weapons to avenge my father's name
Let your eyes scan on the Ghettos, through the books of history
then you'll understand this feeling and just how it came to be
Sure I must admit I'm bitter for the precious blood I've bled
and for the years of cruel oppression that you've heaped upon my head
For the rape of my grandmothers and the mulattos that you've left
for the many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many,
many, many, many years of slavery with its legacy of death
Tell me not that I'm a dreamer, oh no it's you that cannot see
I am just another victim of a cruel reality
What manner of man is this, I ask? Who roams the seven seas
who graces the skies of birds of iron and wanders where he please
Who walks into another's home and takes his properly
Then slays the man, his wife and child in the name of liberty
What manner of beast is this I ask who drops a napalm from the skies
then send my sons away to war to maim and kill and die
What manner of man is this I ask, who arrogantly displays his might
What manner of man is this, my friend, needless to say he's white
So take your hands off of me, white folks, I've done you no wrong
I'm only guilty of making you strong
I've built all of your cities and I've worked in your mines
I've fought to protect you many a time
It was I who taught you what it is to be brave
I had great civilizations when you lived in caves
I taught you what soap was when you dyed yourselves blue
I taught you of planting and harvesting too
I showed you what clothes were to cover your backs
when you were wearing wolfskins and running in packs
When you knew nothing of the barrier of sound
it was I who taught you that this planet was round
In Palermo, Sicily and Italy and Spain
I left monuments of my grandeur and fame
And during your dark ages when your people were blind
I built universities to enlighten your kind
When your homeland was weak and your people were poor
It was I who brought you to America's shore
Why you did not even know how to survive
I showed you medicine to keep you alive
How earnest you seem, how well you did learn
now vile a reward I received in return
But time is on my side, I'm sure you must know
that the day will arrive when you'll reap what you sow
For I gave you Religion and you know it's a fact
that the Christ and the Buddha and Mohammed were black
I taught you to dance and I taught you to sing
You repaid me with treachery and slavery and chains
So don't touch me Whitey and don't look surprised
No I'm no longer fooled by your tricks and your lies
I'm aware of your game and of your history
and I'm aware of the Judas that you've been to me
So watch out for me white folks, It's just a matter of time
I'll soon be together, then Vengeance is mine"

Tra le tue smorfie e le mie dita dentro il naso
Noi due inciampammo contro un bacio all'improvviso

Ma che gli hai fatto tu a quest'aria che respiro
E come fai a starmi dentro ogni pensiero
Giuralo ancora che tu esisti per davvero
Amore mio,
Ma che che cos'hai tu di diverso dalla gente
Di fronte a te che sei per me così importante
Tutto l'amore che io posso è proprio niente...

Comprammo il pane appena cotto e nacque il sole

Close your eyes clear your mind and you'll find you're free
Close your eyes clear your mind come on trust in me
You're riding down the highway, you aint got no highway shoes
But if you're born with nothing child how can you ever, ever lose
Close your eyes (chorus)
Don'tcha know, Can'tcha see, You'll be free - It's alright
Don'tcha know, Can'tcha see, Trust in me - It's alright
Dont'cha know, Can'tcha see. You'll be free - It's alright
Let it go, Then you'll know, You can see
You'll be free - you'll be free - you'll be free
Close your eyes (chorus)
This goodbye to the things you thought you had
You won't care when you realize that life's just a dream, life is a dream that's true
Close your eyes (chorus)"

alguien te sonreirá...piensa,
abre tu mente al sol...

todo irá mejor...

Antes de despertar,
de este, tu cuerpo actual,
verás, tu voz sabrá gritar...
todo irá
todo irá mejor...

Dulce 3 nocturno,
se aparece...
mostrando su signo,
detrás del diamante,
¿será azul?

Dulce 3 nocturno,
necesito,
que cuentes tu historia,
para conocerte...
ven hacia mí,
ven hacia mí,

Crazy horses riding everywhere

It's a warning
It's in every tongue
Gotta stop them crazy
Horses on the run

What a show, there they go
Smoking up the sky, yeah
Crazy horses all got riders
And they're you and I

Never stop and they never die
They just keep on puffin
How they multiply

Crazy horses
Will they never halt
If they keep on moving
Then it's all our fault

What a show, there they go
Smoking up the sky, yeah
Crazy horses all got riders
And they're you and I

So take a good look around
See what they've done
What they've done
They've done, they've done
They've done, they've done
They've done, they've done

I'm on my own now
I'm going home

You've gone away
Hung up my day now
I just can't stay

When I tell you that I love you
I love you much more than you will ever realize
I do

I'm by myself
Up on the shelf now
I'm getting off

When you tell me that you need me
How can I believe you when you're never home to talk
With me"
301,Milton Nascimento,San Vicente,TRACGNE128F147EAF6,1972,"Coração americano, acordei de um sonho estranho
Um gosto de vidro e corte, um sabor de chocolate
No corpo e na cidade, um sabor de vida e morte
Coração americano, com sabor de vidro e corte

A espera na fila imensa, e o corpo negro se esqueçeu
Estava em San Vicente, a cidade e suas luzes
Estavam em San Vicente as mulheres e os homens
Coração americano, com sabor de vidro e corte

As horas não se contavam, e o que era negro anoiteceu
Enquanto se esperava, eu estava em San Vicente
Enquanto acontecia, eu estava em San Vicente
Coração americano, com sabor de vidro e corte"
