0,Big Mama Thornton,Hound Dog,TRWVXTC128F930FFF6,1953,"You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

You told me you was high class
But I could see through that
Yes, you told me you was high class
But I could see through that
And, daddy, I know
You ain't no real cool cat

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You're just an old hound dog
Been snoopin' round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

Aw, listen to that little hound dog, oow
Aw, play it, it's alright up here
Listen to that old hound dog howl, ooh
Aw, play it, boy, play it
Aw, it makes me feel good
Aw, do the mess around right along here
Now wag your tail
Aw, get it
Aw, get it now, get it, get it, get it
Aw, you're a old hound dog

You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
Well, you made me weep and moan
Cause you ain't looking for a woman
All you're lookin' is for a home

You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Quit snoopin' round the door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more
Ooh"
1,Clyde McPhatter,Money Honey,TRLIYZD12903CF35ED,1953,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind

He said, ""Money, honey
Money, honey, money, honey
If you wanna get along with me""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me""

I said, ""Money, honey
Money, honey, money, honey
If you wanna get along with me""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""

She said, ""Money, honey
Money, honey, money, honey
If you wanna get along with me""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come and the women may go
But before I say, I love 'em so

I want money, honey
Money, honey, money, honey
If you wanna get along with me

(If you wanna get along)
Well, make some money
(If you wanna get along)
Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey

(If you wanna get along)
You better give up some money
If you wanna get along with me"
2,Dean Martin,That's Amore,TRHPXES128F92D1932,1953,"(In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasul
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming signore
Scuzzi me, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore

When the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella
Lucky Fella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fasul
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not
Dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore,(amore)
That's amore"
3,Eartha Kitt,Angelitos Negros,TRCSGZT128F931CD87,1953,"Pintor nacido en mi tierra
Con el pincel extranjero
Pintor que sigues el rumbo
De tantos pintores viejos

Aunque la virgen sea blanca
Píntale angelitos negros
Que también se van al cielo
Todos los negritos buenos

Pintor si pintas con amor
Por qué desprecias su color?
Si sabes que en el cielo
También los quiere Dios

Pintor de santos alcoba
Si tienes alma en el cuerpo
Por qué al pintar en tus cuadros
Te olvidaste de los negros

Siempre que pintas iglesias
Pintas angelitos bellos
Pero nunca te acordaste
De pintar un ángel negro"
4,Eartha Kitt,Santa Baby,TRDZYSN128F933D42C,1953,"Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree,
For me.
Been an awful good girl,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa baby, a 54 convertible too,
Light blue.
I'll wait up for you dear,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

Think of all the fun I've missed,
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed,
Next year I could be just as good,
If you'll check off my Christmas list,

Santa baby, I wanna yacht,
And really that's not a lot,
Been an angel all year,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa honey, one little thing I really need,
The deed
To a platinum mine,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex,
And checks.
Sign your 'X' on the line,
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.

Come and trim my Christmas tree,
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's,
I really do believe in you,
Let's see if you believe in me,

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing,
A ring.
I don't mean on the phone,
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight,
Hurry down the chimney tonight,
Hurry, tonight."
5,Eartha Kitt,Under The Bridges Of Paris,TRKQIRI12903CDC7D8,1953,"How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you

Darling, I'd hold you tight
Far from the eyes of night
Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true

How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you

Under the bridges of Paris with you
I'd make your dreams come true"

Got me accused of petting, I can't even raise my hand
Bad luck, bad luck is killing me

Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree
Got me accused of murder, I ain't harmed a man
Got me accused of forgery, I can't even write my name

Got me accused of taxes, I ain't got a dime
Got me accused of children, and ain't nary one of them was mine

Got me accused of children, and ain't nary one of them was mine"

My life and my love, dear
Are yours to command
I stand here before you
My heart in my hand

I'm yours
All the world knows I'm yours
And I only hope and pray
That someday I'll hear you say
I'm yours

I believe I should go back home
I'm gonna get up in the mornin',
I believe I should go back home
I'm gonna find my baby,
acknowledge that I done her wrong
I don't want no woman,
that stays drunk all the time
I don't want no woman,
that stays drunk all the time
Well you know she's a wild woman,
'bout to drive me out of my mind
I believe, I believe,
I'm going back home
I believe, I believe,
I'm going back home
I gotta lie to my baby,

I know I treat my baby wrong"
9,Frank Chacksfield & His Orchestra,Ebb Tide,TRIOZJN128F931EDD8,1953,"First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, you are love
Really mine in the rain

In the dark, in the sun
Oh, like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms"
10,Furry Lewis,John Henry,TRRJYRQ128F428C044,1953,"John Henry was a little baby boy, settin' at home on his mother's knee
Cryin', ""That Big Bend tunnel on that YMV, it's gon' be the death of me, 'fore I die
Lord, it's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord, says it's gon'""

When John Henry hammered in the mountain 'til the head of his hammer caught fire
He cried, ""Y'all just pick 'em up and let 'em down again
Just give me one cool drink of water 'fore I die, Lord, Lord
Just give me one cool drink of water.""

Spoken: You know, one time John Henry had a job to do, one time, Red
He's the best at it, people say that awful day will surely come, that's funny
how it would make it

Said I'm goin' where John Henry fell dead

When the women in the West heard of John Henry's death, they couldn't sleep at home in their beds
Some was dressed in white, some was dressed in red, said
""Take me where John Henry fell dead, baby, please take me (guitar finishes line)
I'm goin' where John Henry fell dead, baby"", he said, ""Lord knows I'm goin' where
John Henry fell dead, dead, I'm goin' where John Henry"" (guitar finishes line)

John Henry told his captain one day, ""You can give me my time
I can make more money on that C &amp; O than I can on that IC line, Lord knows, than I can""

Spoken: You know, one time John Henry had a piker, he had to hold a little piece of steel
just 'bout that tall, he told his piker to hold that steel, he said
What's gonna happen?"", Booker, he says, ""I'm goin' down, I'm gonna drive some steel today.""

11,Gayla Peevey,I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,TRIKZMT12903CF5139,1953,"I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
Don't want a doll, no dinky Tinkertoy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door,
that's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning,
creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy and what surprise
when I open up my eyes
to see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me too

Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian

There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage

I can see me now on Christmas morning,
creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy and what surprise
when I open up my eyes
to see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroseses
I only like hippopotamuseses
And hippopotamuses like me too!"

Comme je n'l'admire pas beaucoup
M'enlève son feu,
Oui mais, d'son feu, moi j'm'en fous
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous
La lumière que je préfère
C'est celle de vos yeux jaloux
Tout le restant m'indiffère
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous

Monsieur mon propriétaire
Comme je lui dévaste tout
M'chasse de son toit,
Oui mais, d'son toit, moi j'm'en fous
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous
La demeure que je préfère
C'est votre robe à froufrous
Tout le restant m'indiffère
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous

Madame ma gargotière
Comme je lui dois trop de sous
M'chasse de sa table,
Oui mais, d'sa table, moi j'm'en fous
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous
Le menu que je préfère
C'est la chair de votre cou
Tout le restant m'indiffère
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous

Sa Majesté financière
Comme je n'fais rien à son goût
Garde son or,
Or, de son or, moi j'm'en fous
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous
La fortune que je préfère
C'est votre cœur d'amadou
Tout le restant m'indiffère
J'ai rendez-vous avec vous"
13,Georges Brassens,Pauvre Martin,TRGQMSH12903D10F9C,1953,"Avec une bêche à l'épaule,
Avec, à la lèvre, un doux chant,
Avec, à la lèvre, un doux chant,
Avec, à l'âme, un grand courage,
Il s'en allait trimer aux champs!

Pauvre Martin, pauvre misère,
Creuse la terre, creuse le temps!

Pour gagner le pain de sa vie,
De l'aurore jusqu'au couchant,
De l'aurore jusqu'au couchant,
Il s'en allait bêcher la terre
En tous les lieux, par tous les temps!

Pauvre Martin, pauvre misère,
Creuse la terre, creuse le temps!

Sans laisser voir, sur son visage,
Ni l'air jaloux ni l'air méchant,
Ni l'air jaloux ni l'air méchant,
Il retournait le champ des autres,
Toujours bêchant, toujours bêchant!

Pauvre Martin, pauvre misère,
Creuse la terre, creuse le temps!

Et quand la mort lui a fait signe
De labourer son dernier champ,
De labourer son dernier champ,
Il creusa lui-même sa tombe
En faisant vite, en se cachant...

Pauvre Martin, pauvre misère,
Creuse la terre, creuse le temps!

Il creusa lui-même sa tombe
En faisant vite, en se cachant,
En faisant vite, en se cachant,
Et s'y étendit sans rien dire
Pour ne pas déranger les gens...

Pauvre Martin, pauvre misère,
Dors sous la terre, dors sous le temps!"
14,Georges Brassens,Brave Margot,TRHKMOH12903CC3992,1953,"Margoton, la jeune bergère,
Trouvant dans l'herbe un petit chat
Qui venait de perdre sa mère
L'adopta...
Elle entr'ouvre sa collerette
Et le couche contre son sein.
C'était tout c'quelle avait, pauvrette,
Comme coussin...
Le chat, la prenant pour sa mère,
Se mit à téter tout de go.
Ému', Margot le laissa faire...
Brav' Margot !
Un croquant, passant à la ronde
Trouvant le tableau peu commun,
S'en alla le dire à tout l'monde,
Et, le lendemain...

Quand Margot dégrafait son corsage
Pour donner la gougoutte à son chat,
Tous les gars, tous les gars du village,
Étaient là, la la la la la la...
Étaient là, la la la la la...
Et Margot, qu'était simple et très sage,
Présumait qu'c'était pour voir son chat
Qu'tous les gars, tous les gars du village,
Étaient là, la la la la la la...
Étaient là, la la la la la...

L'maître d'école et ses potaches,
Le mair', le bedeau, le bougnat,
Négligeaient carrément leur tâche
Pour voir ça...
Le facteur, d'ordinair' si preste,
Pour voir ça, ne distribuait plus
Les lettres que personne, au reste,
N'aurait lues...
Pour voir ça (Dieu le leur pardonne !)
Les enfants de choeur, au milieu
Du saint sacrifice, abandonnent
Le saint lieu...
Les gendarmes, mêm' les gendarmes,
Qui sont par natur' si ballots,
Se laissaient toucher par les charmes
Du joli tableau...

Mais les autr's femm's de la commune
Privé's d'leurs époux d'leurs galants,
Accumulèrent la rancune,
Patiemment...
Puis un jour, ivres de colère,
Elles s'armèrent de bâtons
Et, farouch's, elles immolèrent le chaton...
La bergère, après bien des larmes,
Pour s'consoler prit un mari
Et ne dévoila plus ses charmes
Que pour lui...
Le temps passa sur les mémoires,
On oublie l'événement,
Seuls des vieux racontent encore
À leurs p'tits enfants"
15,Georges Brassens,Comme hier,TRAOFJS12903CF3F3D,1953,"Hé ! donne moi ta bouche, hé ! ma jolie fraise !
L'aube a mis des fraises plein notre horizon
Garde tes dindons, moi mes porcs, Thérèse
Ne repousse pas du pied mes petits cochons

Va, comme hier ! comme hier ! comme hier !
Si tu ne m'aimes point, c'est moi qui t'aimerons
L'un tient le couteau, l'autre la cuiller
La vie, c'est toujours les mêmes chansons

Pour sauter le gros sourceau de pierre en pierre
Comme tous les jours mes bras t'enlèveront
Nos dindes, nos truies nous suivront légères
Ne repousse pas du pied mes petits cochons

Va, comme hier ! comme hier ! comme hier !
Si tu ne m'aimes point, c'est moi qui t'aimerons
La vie, c'est toujours amour et misère
La vie, c'est toujours les mêmes chansons

J'ai tant de respect pour ton cœur, Thérèse
Et pour tes dindons, quand nous nous aimons
Quand nous nous fâchons, hé ! ma jolie fraise
Ne repousse pas du pied mes petits cochons

Va, comme hier ! comme hier ! comme hier !

De Jeanne
Est morte sur son œuf
Et dans son beau costume
De plumes
Tout neuf

C'est nous autres qui eûmes
Les plumes
Et l'œuf

Tous, toutes
Sans doute
Garderons longtemps le
Souvenir de la cane

Will make you weep
You'll cry and cry
And try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

When tears come down
Like falling rain
You'll toss around
And call my name
You'll walk the floor
The way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

Your cheatin' heart
Will pine some day
And crave the love
You threw away
The time will come
When you'll be blue

Your cheatin' heart will tell on you"

Alignés en nombre pair
Comme des sourcils de géant
Leurs crachats de lumière
Les moulins tournent, tournent sans trêve
Emportant tout notre argent
Et nous donnant d'un peu de rêve
Pour que les hommes soient contents

Emportant tout notre argent
Et nous donnant d'un peu de rêve

Ça sent les frites dans les papiers
Ça sent les beignets qu'on mange vite
Ça sent les hommes qui les ont mangés
Partout je vois à petits pas
Des couples qui s'en vont danser
Mais moi sûrement je n'irai pas
Grand-mère m'a dit de me méfier
Partout je vois à petits pas
Des couples qui s'en vont danser

Grand-mère m'a dit de me méfier

Pour se faire tourner la tête
Sur les manèges aux chevaux roux
Au son d'une musique bête
On rentre chez soi lentement
Et tout en regardant les cieux
On se demande simplement
S'il n'existe rien de mieux
On rentre chez soi lentement
Et tout en regardant les cieux
On se demande simplement
S'il n'existe rien de mieux

Make every word a kiss

She was lovelier than ever

You are no doubt familiar with songs about the old lamplighter 
And the old umbrella man and the old garbage collector and all 
These lovable old characters who go around spreading sweetness 
And light to their respective communities. But, it's always seemed 
To me that there is one member of this happy band who does an 
Equally splendid job, but who has never been properly recognized 
In song or story, and this is an attempt to remedy, at least in 
Part, that deplorable situation. 

When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow ev'ryone knows
It's the old dope peddler
Spreading joy wherever he goes
Ev'ry evening you will find him
Around our neighborhood

Doing well by doing good

He gives the kids free samples
Because he knows full well
That today's young innocent faces
Will be tomorrow's clientele

Here's an end to all distress

For many years now, Mr. Danny Kaye, who has been my particular idol since childbirth, has been doing a routine about the great Russian director Stanislavski and the secret of success in the acting profession. And I thought it would be interesting to st--, to adapt this idea to the field of mathematics. I always like to make explicit the fact that before I went off not too long ago to fight in the trenches, I was a mathematician by profession. I don't like people to get the idea that I have to do this for a living. I mean, it isn't as though I had to do this, you know, I could be making, oh, 3000 dollars a year just teaching. 
Be that as it may, some of you may have had occasion to run into mathematicians and to wonder therefore how they got that way. And here, in partial explanation perhaps, is the story of the great Russian mathematician Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky.

Who made me the genius I am today
The mathematician that others all quote
Who's the professor that made me that way?
The greatest that ever got chalk on his coat

One man deserves the credit
One man deserves the blame
And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name
Hi!
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach--

I am never forget the day I first meet the great Lobachevsky. In one word he told me secret of success in Mathematics: Plagiarize!

Plagiarize
Let no one else's work evade your eyes
Remember why the good Lord made your eyes
So don't shade your eyes
But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize
Only be sure always to call it please ""research""

And ever since I meet this man
My life is not the same
And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name
Hi!
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach--

I am never forget the day I am given first original paper to write. It was on analytic and algebraic topology of locally Euclidean parameterization of infinitely differentiable Riemannian manifold. Боже мой!
This I know from nothing. But I think of great Lobachevsky and get idea, ah-ha!

I have a friend in Minsk
Who has a friend in Pinsk
Whose friend in Omsk
Has friend in Tomsk
With friend in Akmolinsk
His friend in Alexandrovsk
Has friend in Petropavlovsk
Whose friend somehow
Is solving now
The problem in Dnepropetrovsk

And when his work is done
Ha ha! Begins the fun
From Dnepropetrovsk
To Petropavlovsk
By way of Iliysk
And Novorossiysk
To Alexandrovsk to Akmolinsk
To Tomsk to Omsk
To Pinsk to Minsk
To me the news will run
Yes, to me the news will run

And then I write
By morning, night
And afternoon
And pretty soon
My name in Dnepropetrovsk is cursed
When he finds out I publish first

And who made me a big success
And brought me wealth and fame?
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name
Hi!
Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach--

I am never forget the day my first book is published. Every chapter I stole from somewhere else. Index I copy from old Vladivostok telephone directory. This book was sensational. Pravda, ah Pravda. Pravda said: Жил-был король, когда-то при нём блоха жила
It stinks!
But Izvestia. Izvestia said: Я иду туда, куда сам царь идёт пешком
It stinks!

You know, of all the songs I have ever sung, that is the one 
I've had the most requests not to.
I have time for one more here. This one is a little song 
Dedicated to the Boy Scouts of America. (applause) We seem 
To have a convention here tonight. The Boy Scouts of America, 
Those noble little bastions of democracy, and the American 
Legion of tomorrow. Their motto is...
I would like to state at this time that I am not now and 
Have never been... a member of the Boy Scouts of America.
Their motto is, as you know, ""Be Prepared,"" and that is 
The name of this song.

Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' marching song
Be prepared! As through life you march along
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well
Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell

Be prepared! To hide that pack of cigarettes
Don't make book if you cannot cover bets
Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure
That they will not be found
And be careful not to smoke them
When the scoutmaster's around
For he only will insist that it be shared
Be prepared!

Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed
Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed
Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice
Unless you get a good percentage of her price

Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you
If you're looking for adventure of a
New and different kind
And you come across a Girl Scout who is
Similarly inclined
Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared

35,Tom Lehrer,My Home Town,TRCRISV12903CF4D4C,1953,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Next we have the ""Dear Hearts And Gentle Peoples"" school 
Of songwriting, in which the singer tells you that, no matter 
How much sin and vice and crime go on where he comes from, 
It's still the best place in the world because it's home, 
You know. Sort of gets you.
This example is called ""My Home Town.""

I really have a yen
To go back once again
Back to the place where no one wears a frown
To see once more those super-special just plain folks
In my home town

No fellow could ignore
The little girl next door
She sure looked sweet in her first evening gown
Now there's a charge for what she used to give for free
In my home town

I remember Dan, the druggist on the corner, 'e
Was never mean or ornery
He was swell
He killed his mother-in-law and ground her up real well
And sprinkled just a bit
Over each banana split

The guy that taught us math
Who never took a bath
Acquired a certain measure of renown
And after school he sold the most amazing pictures
In my home town

That fellow was no fool
Who taught our Sunday School
And neither was our kindly Parson Brown
We're recording tonight so I have to leave this line out
In my home town

I remember Sam, he was the village idiot
And though it seems a pity, it
Was so
He loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow
And nothing could be done
Because he was the mayor's son

The guy that took a knife
And monogrammed his wife
Then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown
Oh, yes indeed, the people there are just plain folks
In my home town"
36,Tom Lehrer,The Hunting Song,TRCVREV12903CF4D4A,1953,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Almost every day during the hunting season you see at least 
One item in the newspapers about somebody who has shot somebody 
Else, under the impression that he was a deer with a red hat 
Perhaps, maybe a large flesh-colored squirrel. At any rate, 
It seems to me that this marks an encouraging new trend in the 
Field of blood sports, and deserves a new type of hunting song,
Which I present herewith.

I always will remember
'Twas a year ago November
I went out to hunt some deer
On a mornin' bright and clear
I went and shot the maximum the game laws would allow
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow

I was in no mood to trifle
I took down my trusty rifle
And went out to stalk my prey
What a haul I made that day
I tied them to my fender, and I drove them home somehow
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a cow

The law was very firm, it
Took away my permit
The worst punishment I ever endured
It turned out there was a reason
Cows were out of season
And one of the hunters wasn't insured

People ask me how I do it
And I say, ""There's nothin' to it
You just stand there lookin' cute
And when something moves, you shoot!""
And there's ten stuffed heads in my trophy room right now
Two game wardens, seven hunters, and a pure-bred Guernsey cow"
37,Tom Lehrer,The Irish Ballad,TRBITKG128F145E407,1953,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Now I'd like to turn to the folk song, which has become in 
Recent years the particularly fashionable form of idiocy among 
The self-styled intellectual. We find that people who deplore 
The level of current popular songs – although I admit they do 
Seem to be recording almost anything these days. Have you heard 
Sesue Hayakawa's record of ""Remember Pearl Harbor""? These same 
People who deplore the level of current popular songs and yet 
Will sit around enthralled singing ""Jimmy crack corn and I 
Don't care"" or ""Green Grow The Rushes, Oh!"" – whatever that 
Means. At any rate, for this elite I have here an ancient Irish 
Ballad, which was written a few years ago, and which is replete 
With all the accoutrements of this art form. In particular, it has 
A sort of idiotic refrain, in this case ""rickety-tickety-tin,""
You'll notice cropping up from time to time, running through, 
I might add, interminable verses – The large number of verses 
Being a feature expressly designed to please the true devotees 
Of the folk song who seem to find singing fifty verses of 
""On Top Of Old Smoky"" is twice as enjoyable as singing twenty-five.
This type of song also has what is known technically in music as 
A modal tune, which means – for the benefit of any layman who 
May have wandered in this evening – that I play a wrong note 
Every now and then, I think you'll notice that.
This song, though, does differ strikingly from the genuine 
Folk ballad in that in this song the words which are supposed 
To rhyme – actually do.
I, ah, I really should say that – I do not direct these remarks 
Against the vast army of folk song lovers, but merely against 
That peculiar hardcore who seem to equate authenticity with 
Artistic merit and illiteracy with charm.
Oh – one more thing. One of the more important aspects of public 
Folk singing is audience participation, and this happens to be a 
Good song for group singing. So if any of you feel like joining 
In with me on this song, I'd appreciate it if you would leave – 
Right now!

About a maid I'll sing a song
Sing rickety-tickety-tin
About a maid I'll sing a song
Who didn't have her family long
Not only did she do them wrong
She did every one of them in
Them in
She did every one of them in

One morning in a fit of pique
Sing rickety-tickety-tin
One morning in a fit of pique
She drowned her father in the creek
The water tasted bad for a week
And we had to make do with gin
With gin
And we had to make do with gin

Her mother she could never stand
Sing rickety-tickety-tin
Her mother she could never stand
And so a cyanide soup she planned
Her mother died with a spoon in her hand
And her face in a hideous grin
A grin
Her face in a hideous grin

She set her sister's hair on fire
Rickety-tickety-tin
She set her sister's hair on fire
And as the smoke and flame rose higher
Danced around the funeral pyre
Playin' a violin
'Olin
Playin' a violin

She weighted her brother down with stones
Rickety-tickety-tin
She weighted her brother down with stones
And sent him off to Davy Jones
All they ever found were some bones
And the occasional pieces of skin
Of skin
Occasional pieces of skin

One day when she had nothing to do
Rickety-tickety-tin
One day when she had nothing to do
She cut her baby brother in two
And served him up as an Irish stew
And invited the neighbors in
'Bors in
Invited the neighbors in

And when at last the police came by
Rickety-tickety-tin
And when at last the police came by
Her little pranks she did not deny
To do so she would have had to lie
And lying she knew was a sin
A sin
Lying she knew was a sin

My tragic tale I won't prolong
Rickety-tickety-tin
My tragic tale I won't prolong
And if you do not enjoy my song
You've yourselves to blame if it's too long
You should never have let me begin
Begin
You should never have let me begin"
38,Tom Lehrer,I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,TRFUAII128F9323033,1953,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Well, what I like to do on formal occasions like this is to take 
Some of the various types of songs that we all know and presumably 
Love, and, as it were, to kick them when they're down. I find that 
If you take the various popular song forms to their logical extremes, 
You can arrive at almost anything from the ridiculous to the obscene, 
Or – as they say in New York – sophisticated. I'd like to 
Illustrate with several hundred examples for you this evening, 
First of all, the southern type song about the wonders of the 
American south. But it's always seemed to me that most of these 
Songs really don't go far enough. The following song, on the other 
Hand, goes too far. It's called ""I Wanna Go Back To Dixie.""

I wanna go back to Dixie
Take me back to dear ol' Dixie
That's the only li'l ol' place for li'l ol' me
Ol' times there are not forgotten
Whuppin' slaves and sellin' cotton
And waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
(It was never there on time)
I'll go back to the Swanee
Where pellagra makes you scrawny
And the Honeysuckle clutters up the vine
I really am a-fixin'
To go home and start a-mixin'
Down below that Mason-Dixon line

Oh, poll tax, how I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old poll tax

Won'tcha come with me to Alabammy
Back to the arms of my dear ol' Mammy
Her cookin's lousy and her hands are clammy
But what the hell, it's home
Yes, for paradise the Southland is my nominee
Jes' give me a ham hock and a grit of hominy

I wanna go back to Dixie
I wanna be a dixie pixie
And eat cornpone 'til it's comin' outta my ears
I wanna talk with Southern gentlemen
And put my white sheet on again,
I ain't seen one good lynchin' in years
The land of the boll weevil
Where the laws are medieval
Is callin' me to come and nevermore roam
I wanna go back to the Southland
That ""y'all"" and ""shet-ma-mouth"" land
Be it ever so decadent
There's no place like home"
39,Tom Lehrer,The Wiener Schnitzel Waltz,TRZQBNQ128F932304B,1953,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
Now to continue with the love song, here we have the 
Viennese waltz type of the Franz Lehár/Johann Strauss 
School, conjuring up images of gaily waltzing couples 
And probably stale champagne drunk from sweaty slippers. 
This example is called ""The Wiener Schnitzel Waltz.""

Do you remember the night I held you so tight
As we danced to the Wiener Schnitzel Waltz?
The music was gay, and the setting was Viennese
Your hair wore some roses (or perhaps they were peonies)
I was blind to your obvious faults
As we danced 'cross the scene
To the strains of the Wiener Schnitzel Waltz 

Oh, I drank some champagne from your shoe, la l-la
I was drunk by the time I got through, la l-la
For I didn't know as I raised that cup
It had taken two bottles to fill the thing up

It was I who stepped on your dress, la l-la
The skirts all came off, I confess, la l-la
Revealing for all of the others to see
Just what it was that endeared you to me . . . 

I remember the night I held you so tight
As we danced to the Wiener Schnitzel Waltz
Your lips were like wine (if you'll pardon the simile)
The music was lovely and quite Rudolf Frimly
I drank wine, you drank chocolate malts
And we both turned quite green
To the strains of the Wiener Schnitzel Waltz"

Now if I may indulge in a bit of personal history.
A few years ago I worked for a while at the Los Alamos scientific laboratory in New Mexico.
I had a job there as a spy. No, I guess you know that the staff out there at that time was composed almost exclusively of spies... of one persuasion or another.
And, while I was out there, I came to realize how much the Wild West had changed since the good  old days of Wyatt Earp and ""Home on the Range""
And here then is a modern cowboy ballad commemorating that delightful metamorphosis called ""The Wild West Is Where I Wanna Be.""

Along the trail you'll find me lopin'
Where the spaces are wide open
In the land of the old A.E.C.  Yee-hoo!
Where the scenery's attractive
And the air is radioactive
Oh, the Wild West is where I wanna be

'Mid the sagebrush and the cactus
I'll watch the fellows practice
Droppin' bombs through the clean desert breeze
A-ha!
I'll have on my sombrero
And of course I'll wear a pair o'
Levis over my lead B.V.D.'s

I will leave the city's rush
Leave the fancy and the plush
Leave the snow and leave the slush
And the crowds
I will seek the desert's hush
Where the scenery is lush
How I long to see the mush-room clouds

'Mid the yuccas and the thistles
I'll watch the guided missiles
While the old F.B.I. watches me
Yee-hoo!
Yes, I'll soon make my appearance
(Soon as I can get my clearance)
'Cause the Wild West is where I wanna be"

It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure that I'm hopin' for
