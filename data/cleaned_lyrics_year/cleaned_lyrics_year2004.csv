Something ya'll don't know nuthin about.  All these groups I hear claming
underground.  How much you pay that f**kin DJ to spin that?  MTV to play that? 
That freestyle, how much for that?  Hahahaa

(Prozak)
Goin insane my brain refrains from the pain of being lame
Ya'll should be a monopoly and not f**k with this rap game
It's a shame this industry's standards got ya'll tainted
But you're paraded and playded got you devastated and hated
So f**k it so sick of the mainstreams and fantasy pipe dreams
I'm sick of drama queens don't follow me or I'll let these demons outta me
With a vengeance it's a wicked evil presence
Now wanna pretend this aint real like Vacil Prozak's ill
I'm talkin bout NyQuil don't wana drive?  Well I will
Strait to hell all because you have to do what thou will
But I am not concerned I hope this lesson's learned
Sit on the edge of the industry dog and watch it burn

It's Project Deadman comin from the underground
Wicked is how we kick it arrested but never convicted
Your time has come this shit is goin down
Your whole life trying to find something real
We're Project Deadman and we're bringin that sound
We're from the murder glove bitch we got issues
We got the wicked shit we'll never let it down
Project Deadman more underground the hell

Project PDM Deadman
Project PDM Deadman
Project PDM Deadman
More underground PDM then mother f**kin hell

(Prozak)
I'm droppin 16 bars leave you with metal scars
Crazy and ran that speaks on rap beats with rock guitars
Bizzare and yet ridiculous it's so maticulous
So sick with this we meditated my crimes aint victimless
F**k how you feel f**k keepin it real F**k the mass appeal 
And f**k the same old shit and f**k your record deal
Many have tried but failed now watch their bodies fail
It's Project Deadman more underground then f**kin hell

It's Project Deadman comin from the underground
Wicked is how we kick it arrested but never convicted
Your time has come this shit is goin down
Your whole life trying to find something real
We're Project Deadman and we're bringin that sound
We're fromt he murder glove bitch we got issues
We got the wicked shit we'll never let it down
Project Deadman more underground the hell

You tryin to get inside?  Access denied
You'll be leavin in a you'll be leavin in a body bag
You tryin to get inside?  Access denied
I am the Deadman walking

Project Deadman.  Our pledge to the undergorund is wicked even though life is
self inflicted.  And that f**kin beat is how we ripped it.  Also deadly to the
underground committed

It's Project Deadman comin from the underground
Wicked is how we kick it arrested but never convicted
Your time has come this shit is goin down
Your whole life trying to find something real
We're Project Deadman and we're bringin that sound
We're fromt he murder glove bitch we got issues
We got the wicked shit we'll never let it down
Project Deadman more underground the hell"

Vroom vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom
My mind is racing

[Verse 1]
When you young you talk shit and get slapped up for it
The ice, the cars, the clothes, we already bought it
The streets, the projects, the hood, we already support it
The rep, the respect, them cases we already carted
The gold, the platinum plaques, we already flaunted
The leathers in freezing weathers we already sported
The wise see your lies and you already shorted
Them boys they talkin to boys, we men we ignore it
The whole planet, so-called Earth, we already toured it
My levels be on max with the bass distorted
When the economy is up we getting all of that
When the economy is down we still touring Jack
Look back at '88, where them ballers at?
They was buyin' out the bar, I ain't fall for that
Spending they money, you'd think the club would call them back
But they didn't, that shit was all an act
I go

[Chorus 1]
Vroom vroom

Vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing

I said my mind is racing like
Vroom vroom vroom

[Chorus 2] (2X)
I'm a warrior
I'm a warrior
In this concrete jungle it's hard to stay humble
I'm a warrior
I'm a warrior
I bring that drama to whoever, whenever, WHAT!

[Verse 2]
Yo, let me tell you 'bout defeating the drama
In the street with the armour
It's the teacher, Kris Parker
I be in the hood, looking good, speaking of honour
Being a father
Not avoid the baby mama drama
Respect myself I gotta, we gotta live proper
The True hip-hopper, hits yes a non-stopper
A no quitter, heavy hitter
Looks within to, be the winner
Now let us begin the orientation
Hip-hop culture is what we call the nation
But annihilation is what we facing
Cats getting killed from Scott La Rock to Jam Master Jason
That's why we was at the United Nations
Laying down the foundation
For hip-hop as a real nation
You know what time we wastin?
But...

4,Mary Chapin Carpenter,Beautiful Racket,TRSLTGW128F42836A1,2004,"So your day begins like this
Wondering what might have been
Old regrets and chances missed
Borne away on some lambent wind
Job's ok, so it doesn't inspire
Thoughts of leaving it all behind
You used to have dreams of settin' the world on fire
All you want now is peace of mind

And a beautiful racket, in whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet, between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

You do your dreaming in traffic jams
You do your running in shopping malls
You do your breathing the best you can
Between car pools and cell phone calls
Who cares, you'll never live in Paris
So what, you'll never travel by Lear
How some of us learn what matters
While others never get to hear

Such a beautiful racket, in whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet, between the truces and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And all of the wisdom between a smile and a tear

Hold on, hold on

So your day will end like this
Turning slowly down your street
Silent worlds of kitchens lit
Front yards full of fallen leaves
Trees are bare, the garden's done
Another season gone to earth
Before you blink a new one comes
To remind you what the old one's worth

And the beautiful racket, comes in whispers and roars
The bitter and sweet, between the roses and the wars
The noise and the quiet, the courage and the fear
And the infinite wisdom when you hear

Such a beautiful racket... such a beautiful racket... hold on... such a beautiful racket... hold on..."
5,WINTERSUN,Starchild,TRYKCPR128F427FD76,2004,"[Part I: Wanderer of Time]

So mysterious is your world
Concealed beyond the stars
Far away from the earth
It flows one with time and dark as the night
Million shapes and colours
Are storming inside your mind
Creating endless dimensions
Forming universes without walls
Walls

Let go, of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea
Let go, of your thoughts and dreams
What can you see now

You cannot save them anymore
Wanderer of time
It's too late now
Creator of Dimensions
Destroy the walls of time
Hands of the blind are holding your fate
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away

Starchild
Visions are born from the unknown force
It dominates the way of time
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end
When the worlds come to an end
Starchild
You cannot escape to the dark streams of the sea
To suppress your dreams
Nothing can keep you away from the need to create
'Cause your path is free

[Part II: Burning Star]

I've hold the fire within myself
Years I've walked in the coldest winds
Through the deserts of sand and snow
The time is passing and I know
That I'm wasting my life, destroying my dreams
I'm diving into the bottomless sea
From sorrow and pain I find my strength
The more pain I feel, the more I see
Now I'm watching my life flowing in the dark
Like streams of fear running through my heart
And it's wearing me down until I'm gone
Soon I'll join the endless whirls of stars
And I fall (something is dying, yet something is born) deeper into the unknown voids
And I fall (when will I find my silent dawn) into infinity like a burning star
I fall like a burning star
I fall like a burning star
I fall like a burning star

[Part III: The Creation]

The curtains of mist are fading
And the veils of star clouds are revealed
Storms of new energy flows in the depths of my mind
New constellations are born in total harmony of perfection
And the dissonant unbalance was broken
As the colours fell straight from the light

[Part IV: The Sea of Stars]

I'm floating in the sea of stars
I'm drifting away from the shore
I will be lost in the dream when the dark days come
But I will make the time run backwards and
I'll make the stars shine again
I will light up the sky to a bright crimson nights
And they'll shine together forever
With brilliant silver colours they'll shine forever

[Part V: Finale]

The whirls of stars takes you now (far away)
Away from the cold nightmare
Let go of you thoughts and dreams
And you will feel the warmth once again
Starchild, in the Sea of Stars you fall
You fall like a burning
Starchild, in the Sea of Stars you fall
But there is no end to creation"

Que yo haría por ti, derretiría
El icerberg que habita en tu pasión
Yo lucharía con quien sea por ganar tu amor
Me metería por los poros de tu corazon
Me transformaría en el hombre invisible
Para estar siempre junto a ti
Lo haría por ti, lo haría por ti, por ti
No me vaciles no digas uju
No te exagero lo haría por ti
No te voltees no digas uju

Dime que si no me hagas sufrir
No me vaciles no digas uju
No te exagero lo haria por ti
No te voltees no digas uju
Dime que si no me hagas sufrir
Prepararía una bebida con gotas de amor
Y que al beberla piense que soy tu mejor opostor
Liquidaría al que sea por burlar tu amor
Y no me importa si ese es Sylvester Stallone

Me transformaría en el hombre invisible
Para estar siempre junto a ti
Lo haría por ti, lo haría por ti, por ti

No me vaciles no digas uju
No te exagero lo haría por ti
No te voltes no digas uju
Dime que si no me hagas sufrir je je
No me vaciles no digas uju
No te exagero lo haría por ti
No te voltes no digas uju
Dime que si no me hagas sufrir je je
Estas son cosas que haría por ti
Pon atención y oído al tambor

Aprendería a escribir japones tomando
Un curso tan solo un mes
Retaría a Ronaldo y Zidane con ojos vendados
Con 8 punas
Le afeitaría la barba a Fidel y le diría
También lo feo que se
Bajaría a charlar con el diablo para que
A los malos les dieran por el año
Me transformaría en el hombre invisible
Para estar siempre junto a ti
Lo haría por ti, lo haría por ti, por ti

No me vaciles no digas uju
No te exagero lo haría por ti
No te voltees no digas uju
Dime que si no me hagas sufrir je je
No me vaciles no digas uju

Love the rum bar, yet them hate the pure house

9,The Get Up Kids,In Your Sea,TRKCJRV128E07844BF,2004,"Every afternooon
A point I hammer home
You had no follow through, 
follow through
Better off alone

Wading patiently
Stranded in your sea

Sing in time and tune
Where the action is
Don't need the stars and moon, 
stars and moon
Just wanted more than this

Wading patiently
Stranded in your sea

Cause I'm waiting for you
And all you can do
So little to prove
Time is the test of trust
gets the best of us
For hours, for hours

Every afternooon
A point I hammer home
I have no time for you, 
time for you
You're better off alone

Wading patiently
Stranded in your sea

because I'm waiting for you
And all you can do
So little to prove 
nobody knew, it must have been you
I didn't approve
But someday I'll be free
And you'll wait for me

10,Senser,Silent By,TRNUBAI128F92FF435,2004,"Theres a form in the path, bloated seed that you cast
It distracts as it breathes, from the cracks that it leaves
Gorgon screens, time congeals round the mind
Till I'm sealed, like a fly trapped in grease
Losing limbs, a metaphore for your land locked dreams
A cross hung, in dead air
Your gelatinous words will not penetrate there.
Your consent is just a fiction manufactured to the letter
Protected from yourself by someone who knows better
Fate keepers, in constipated linear structures
Each puppet works a puppet, think you can ever stop it?
Crystalised my mouth dries, the gap yawns to the size
Of impossible loss and I'm fully transported and
Standing at the ice hacking at the surface,
Forms loom beneath it a well that holds a timeless secret.
I wont sit silent by.
Don't you secretly sigh for
A way to bridge the dark and endless spaces
The void left by apathy and sucking need?
If each atom touches to every other
I'll generate send the wave riding out.
I am not buying; you are trying my patience
Invest my mind in a sounder kind of gold
The yolk nourishing, here within lies a stronger hold
Bolder words unfolding a cooler, older, absurder version
I wont be casting any worthless aspersions
You took my name and number from a gift list
Insist this is the cheapest, latest
Fortunes are attached, no risks asterisked
I am a seed carried high across the sky of infinite life
If I get stripped of my wings
I will be dropping headlong at a world so gone
Sponsored by, fixed the score
Blame who induced, introduced this meglomanic war
No cure-all preparation for a fundamental human flaw
And we still want more
A million gobs, all teeth, grief and screaming
Faceless tantrum, repressed fury becomes
Dead and doldrum
I cannot centre; I'm hell-bent and burning
Open and undone expose the empty answers, someone
I wont sit silent by.
This war is bloodless and silent
Relentlessly tightened
Majesticaly subtle
Adjusting the totals
My reason and purpose
My body is worthless
Aware as if heightened
The subtext is fat
A gobfull of grease
And they like it like that
But im alive underneath
A kind of firewheel centre says
""The lies are obese""
I wont sit silent by.
This aint kansas
I recognise you
I think I can taste blood
I cant feel my legs"

You take your orders from the queen of insanity
But the contract said it was you and me
I sacrificied family, my children and my soul
To give you what you wanted, complete control

You tried to kill the love and to isolate
But then you turn around, like it's not too late
You justify your actions, forget what you have done
But no more blackmail and no more fun
Day in, day out negativity
Beat me down with your own family
Your bloodline runs in a world of hate
Of dirty white lies and to dominate

Lonely people just trying to find their way
Looking for something, but this is the price I pay

You thought I was stupid, you thought I was blind
You had me by the balls but your well ran dry
You took it all for granted and tried to bring me down

First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin em
His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Binghamton
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breakin his little sister
His pops just past
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started f**kin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carrots pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothin personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody f**k an age difference
From those in the world to those in the ca****
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical

And when you see me comin you know what is better to do

Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putin niggas heads to bed like crapmadics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide

If I don't don't do it with music imma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and the fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His Heaven

No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in

O holy child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight"
17,Caedmon's Call,Volcanoland,TRFQYOJ128F92E9CF7,2004,"Hola, me llamo Efrain
I was born among the agave
All I need is this transistor radio
I am in a band, it's a family band
With the brothers in the years above me
And now we have a song that we'd like to play you

He sang, ""Volcano
We're living in the shade of the volcano
The Volcano
We're living in the shade of the volcano""

A bumpy ride on the buss to the amber hill
I was feeling like a hundred pesos
But something in my soul was certainly there to stay
And nothing on the hill goes without
Their beloved mother's say-so
So everything is alright, everything is O.K.

She said, ""Volcano
You're living in the shade of the volcano
The Volcano
El Señor es siempre bueno""

Home for me is beneath the pine trees
That grow to be about sixty feet tall
And on the back of the SUVs is a mustang sticker
And a feeling that never leaves you alone

Volcano
You're living in the shade of the volcano
The Volcano
You're living in the shade of the volcano
The Volcano
You're living in the shade of the volcano
The Volcano
El Señor es siempre bueno"

everything you need to let go

when we breathe we feel

lay my thought down right here right now
i can't breathe my speech is slow
i don't know i just don't know
whether or not i will speak
i want to breathe i want to breathe
we are off
and we can't pretend for a second that were clean
we are off
and the path blacking out and its so hard feeling the pain of not breathing
we are off
and we cant pretend for a second that we clean
we are off
and the path will not open until i say go
its hard feeling the pain of not breathing
(when we speak we breathe when we breathe we feel)
its hard feeling the pain of not breathing
(when we speak we breathe when we breathe we feel)
letting the light spread
when the energy is amongst our fingertips
letting the waves crash
when they're able to cause danger
is where we descend

it can break you down
you can't break me down

You'll end up like her soon, 6 feet under ground, loser! 

I came here to watch you bleed, oh how I love to gloat 
If you had any balls at all, you'd grab me by the throat 
You don't even look like me, ha! Not even close! 
You're an aberration, some freak...I suppose, loser!

It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know this, them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And  don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a now back too, the thugs then we do what them got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff things come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block-off traffic
Then them wheel and pop off and them start clap it
With the pin file dung and it a beat rapid
Police come inna jeep and them cant stop it
Some say them a playboy (them) a playboy rabbit
Funny man a get dropped like a bad habit
So don't bother pose off if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone!

Welcome to Jamrock, Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it merther!

Welcome to Jamdown, poor people are dead at random
Political violence, can't done! Pure ghost and phantom, the youth
them get blind by stardom
Now the King Of Kings a call
old man to Pickney, so wave one hand if you with me
To see the sufferation sicken me
Them suit no fit me, to win election them trick we 
And them don't do nuttin at all

Come on let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most a the youths them waste it
And when they waste it, that's when they take the guns, replace it
Then them don't stand a chance at all
And that's why a nuff little youth have up some fat matic
With the extra magazine inna them back pocket
And a bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who not lock glocks, at them a lock rocket
Them will full you up a current like a short circuit
Them a run a roadblock which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin not stop clock it
If they run outta rounds a broke- back ratchet

Welcome to Jamrock (Southside, Northside)
Welcome to Jamrock (East Coast, West Coast, huh, yo)
Welcome to Jamrock (Cornwall, Middlesex &amp; Surrey) Hey!

 Swim towards the sun.
 Every day ain't Mother's Day,
 And every woman ain't your mum,
 Sometimes funky isn't fun.

 To become somebody else.
 But at this particular point in time,
 I'll hang on to myself.

 And I... I... I...

 People throw Forget-Me-Nots,
 The bullets through the flesh they're shot,
 A tattoo with a name.
 It's harder to forget the hate,
 When it's the only thing you generate,
 And it's you I'd like to blame.

 It would be easy,
 To blame somebody else.
 But at this particular point in time,
 I'd like to take the blame myself.

Now I'm left alone at home
To sit and think all day

the hat was awful rad
wore it everyday
Made my teacher mad

So I'll be keeping it dull tonight, for I deserve to hurt.
Disfigure the outside to show how ruined I am.
There's no pain and no pleasure when you're too numb to feel.

There's a pedestal across the room,
And if I try to climb again
This time the fall is fatal.
I don't deserve such an easy exit
So maybe my, spine will snap on impact
And I'll have to crawl away.

I'm ready to take that big step.
Start tearing off the layers I put up,
Or is it too late to feel anything but what I am?
I dare to find a problem.
Now it seems, we can fix anything.

Just close the door and let me do what I need, 
'cause it's better for us if you just let me leave.

So, take off the necklace he stole from his mother, it doesn't mean what it meant before. Pack up your pictures and gather your clothes, but leave the lingerie he bought you on the floor. It made you so awkward, you felt like a whore… It's not you, it's not you anymore.

All because of you
All because of you
I am... I am

I like the sound of my own voice
I didn't give anyone else a choice
An intellectual tortoise
Racing with your bullet train

Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
Some people got high rises on their backs
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
You can make me perfect again

All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am... I am

Of the place I started out from
And I want back inside

And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh

I zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice

Close your eyes

y conocí el estadio Azteca,
me quedé duro, me aplastó ver al gigante,
de grande me volvió a pasar lo mismo,
pero ya estaba duro mucho antes...

No matter where I go and try to get paid
They never give me a good job cause they are afraid
That I'ma stick 'em up, oh yes stick it
Rob the manager and everybody in it
That's the everyday life of a convict
Tryin to make it, why their saying to me...

Blocking dimes, lookin' out for police
Cause this the type of shit that we go through
Up in the ghetto just to make some cheese
The street type got me gettin' locked up 
About 5-6 times a week and then I make mon'
Take it from the profit of the weed
All this just to feed my seeds (yeah)

I gotta stop this livin
I witness one too many killings
I don't seen the hardest nigga street talk to the clown 
That was never ever found, so...

CHORUS 2X

I'm trying to stay away from trouble everyday
But its hard when the things you need
Picture lookin at your babies in the face
When they hungry and they need to eat
I'm tryin not to do wrong 
But they wont let me do right
Even tho I done changed my life
Criminal records' what they judging me by, that's why...

39,American Music Club,Patriot's Heart,TRRAIJZ128F4289264,2004,"If you want to see something patriotic there's a stripper
He don't that look that good
But he's got an all american smile
That fills his underwear with all the lonely dollars
From all the lonely men
Who no one ever suffers
Who wait around this bar
And spend all their lonely hours
They're already gone
No one's running for cover
The farther you run away
The more you have to hide in the dark
White as the worm that crawls in the patriot's heart

It is so red white and blue the way he works the bar
Selling his embraces like Mr. President or a fallen star
And he don't care if you're worldly or wise
He's just looking for men with sin in their eyes
And he always says the same thing
He says ""So how you doin' baby
I'm your rod and your staff
And for a tip you can touch me""
And after a few tequilas I become something holy
And this crappy little bar with its sweating mirrors
And its mildewed ceiling
Are more love
Than even natural selection
And dollar for dollar babe
It's a better bargain
The more you pay the more I can break you all apart
And dollars pour like ashes from the patriot's heart

Now he knows that your good time will kill him
But the thought of getting old, well it does not thrill him
He says ""give me all your money and don't tell me what you're thinking
I'm the past you wasted
I'm the future you're obliterating
Ah, c’mon grandpa remind me what you're celebrating
That you're heart finally dried up
Or that it finally stopped working
And how you make a dead man come
You learn the undertakers art
And make 'em shine like the alcohol that preserves the patriot's heart

We all want a patriot's heart
Give me your patriot's heart

You can see him fade with the dawn and a pile of washingtons
His head in a spin, he's happy to pass out again
He would rather fade into the static than hear the violins
That whine like old lovers who whine that they love him
He would rather laugh alone in the dark with the soft hands of heaven
Because they'd leave him alone with his entertainment system
He does it for the money but he gives more than he's given
He does it for the money but he gives more than he's given
And it's only when he's naked that he feels his heart
In the whorehouse desert of the patriot's heart

We all want a patriot's heart
We all want a patriot's heart"

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

(chorus)

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

(chorus)

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me."

What will you say if your eyes went blind

What will you say if your best friend 
Wouldn't have anything to do with you anymore

And your boy gets tricky 
And time flies 
And people have lives 
He had to let you go 
Cos everyone else 
Had to let you go

What will you say if your eyes went blind 
Couldn't differ night from day 
What will you say if your best friend 
Wouldn't have anything to do with you anymore

Left is a secret you can't hide 
You find your way out 
Left is everyone you didn't bring along 
All that you didn't want to come

Die for the night 
And the sun and the moon in your eyes

Your time

Is out"

nunca dijiste por qué.
Yo me consuelo pensando
que fue traición de mujer.

Varón, pa' quererte mucho,
varón, pa' desearte el bien,
varón, pa' olvidar agravios
porque ya te perdoné.
Tal vez no lo sepas nunca,
tal vez no lo puedas creer,
¡tal vez te provoque risa
verme tirao a tus pies!

Es fácil pegar un tajo
pa' cobrar una traición,
o jugar en una daga
la suerte de una pasión.
Pero no es fácil cortarse
los tientos de un metejón,
cuando están bien amarrados
al palo del corazón.

Milonga que hizo tu ausencia.
Milonga de evocación.
Milonga para que nunca
la canten en tu balcón.
Pa' que vuelvas con la noche
y te vayas con el sol.
Pa' decirte que sí a veces
o pa' grïtarte que no."

57,Badly Drawn Boy,Another Devil Dies,TROQDHL12903D0A631,2004,"Well your face still makes my day *audience applause*
Just like it did in the past when you turned me away 
I kept coming back for more
Thats the choice I chose
You were so distant
But I stayed close

It feels like we've weathered the storm
But without having the privilege of calm

And when we sing I hear another devil dies
When that bell rings an angel get its wings 
And if I pushed would you all fall down
Cos I don't need this on my back

The hatred will tear us apart
If you don't do what you did at the start

Now should I go or will you stay
Will find a plan of attack
There's a price to pay for showing no reaction to all the simple things
In time you will know what I know
But for now you win

The hatred will tear us apart
Another devil will take out your heart

But when we sing I hear another devil dies
When that bell rings an angel gets its wings
And if I pushed would you all fall down
Cos I don't need this on my back

It seems like we've weathered the storm
Without having the privilege of calm"

Cold sweat running down my skin
This feeling I loathe, This feeling I craved
To drown again in to emotional pain,
To burn in the fire of misery

Warm flames licking my skin
Intense feeling of suffering
My vision will fade,
My heart will break
Help me now, no,
Please let me go!

Pain so extreme as to cause writhing
I'm convulsed by the agony.
I'm alive yet, I wish I was dead,
I close my eyes and take the dying breath.

Pain, pain, go away, come back again another day.
I can only escape it for a while, kill this pain, take it away.
All my pain, all away and here it comes back again..."

A quién van a mentirle ahora tus labios
A quién vas a decirle ahora ""te amo""
Y luego en el silencio le darás tu cuerpo
Detendrás el tiempo sobre la almohada
Pasarán mil horas en tu mirada
Sólo existirá la vida amándote
Ahora quién?

Y quién te escribirá poemas y cartas
Y quién te contará sus miedos y faltas
A quién le dejarás dormirse en tu espalda
Y luego en el silencio le dirás ""te quiero""
Detendrás su aliento sobre tu cara
Perderá su rumbo en tu mirada
Y se le olvidará la vida amándote
Ahora quién?

Ahora quién si no soy yo
Me miro y lloro en el espejo y me siento estúpido
Ilógico, y luego te imagino toda regalando el olor de tu piel
Tus besos, tu sonrisa eterna y hasta el alma en un beso
En un beso va el alma
Y en mi alma está el beso que pudo ser

A quién le dejarás tu aroma en la cama?
A quién le quedará el recuerdo mañana?
A quién le pasarán las horas con calma?
Y luego en el silencio deseará tu cuerpo
Se detendrá el tiempo sobre su cara
Pasará mil horas en la ventana
Se le acabará la voz llamándote
Ahora quién?
Ahora quién?

Ahora quién si no soy yo?
Me miro y lloro en el espejo y me siento estúpido
Ilógico, y luego te imagino toda regalando el olor de tu piel
Tus besos, tu sonrisa eterna y hasta el alma en un beso

Two lovers acting like strangs
Society won't cage

Bad thoughts to hide

So I changed huh? You got a phone
pick it up, call me

How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

We were so young 
So full of life and vibrance 
side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side 
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
and a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it. 
You even had the same type of childhood I did.. 
sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it 
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us.. 
and I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it. you're cold
your touch is just like ice. 
And your eyes is a look of resentment.
I can sense it and I dont like it.

How Come.. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how

(Kon Artis)

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse 
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse
fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
for I let him disrespect me, or check me over some 
worthless bitch that I wasnt with
I woulda hit it and quit
but you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you dont get involved with her
you would smoke in the car with her
coming outta the bar with her
stumbling half drunk
like you were husband and wife or somethin
but me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
cause you were openin your mouth to people like you wanted with me.
when all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
you acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose.
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.
Dont hate the game or the player
the one thats changing is you.

(Proof)

Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
now we acting like I gotta live only for the block.
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
like my finger get to snappin
and poof it just happen. 
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown, 
shady made it so my babies aint starving at home. 
See the devil in your glance, 
since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence, 
thats forever till the end. 
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies, 
aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise. 
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life? 
And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away, 
we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face.

And there's no one there to judge you
At least that's what you tell yourself, but

Don't you know nobody drinks alone
Every demon, every ghost from your past
And every memory you've held back
Follows you home, nobody drinks alone.

You remember whiskey on your daddy's breath
So you always stick to wine
And you scared your little brother half to death
You just kept it all inside
You can hear your mama cryin'
Only now she cries for you, and

Don't you know nobody drinks alone
Every demon, every ghost from your past
And every memory you've held back
Follows you home, nobody drinks alone.

She’s thinking as he shoves (her) against the wall
Screaming, ""Well then what good are you for,
you don’t give me no pleasure at all""

""Oh now I know I need to leave""
So she tells herself again
Wipes a little blood upon her sleeve
But she don’t tell herself when

And the baby starts a-crying, daddy sits back down
Sinks another drink to bring his temper down
And it’s in each they’re reflecting on the tv screen
Reminds her of a better day she thought she’d seen

But now take your time before you grieve
And keep your heart held off your sleeve
'Cause ain’t no one but you deceived
Your sympathy is soon to leave

And now hide your mouth before you speak
Better yet just turn a cheek
Watch your interest growing weak
But still you say that I’m the freak
And I guess that’s fine with me

""But he’s probably had a long, long day""
She’s thinking in the kitchen while she weeps
Putting dinner’s left-overs away
As he stumbles off to bed and then to sleep

And surely he’ll be better come the dawn
When I rise to cook him breakfast 'fore he goes
Wakes without a word and then he’s gone
He’s got that kinda love that never shows

And baby starts a-wailin' and daddy comes back out
""Shut up that child"" she hears him shout
And cradled in her arms she tries to calm the sound
""How am I to sleep?"" he screams and slaps her down

But now take your time before you grieve
And keep your heart held off your sleeve
'Cause ain’t no one but you deceived
Your sympathy is soon to leave

And now hide your mouth before you speak
Better yet just turn a cheek
Watch your interest growing weak
But still you say that I’m the freak
And I guess that’s fine with me

When she wakes her head don’t cease to pain
Body's broken and her clothes all torn away
Still the threat of emptiness remains
As she struggles to her feet to get away

""Help, where has my child gone?""
She screams as she runs from room to room
Every sound of silence lingers on
Not a single kick inside her womb

And her mind drowns in the shadows, mama falls back down
Where the walls that shape her world seem taller from the ground
And no more breath to scream, her throat just drips away
And no more life to lose as if there were to save

But now take your time before you grieve
And keep your heart held off your sleeve
'Cause ain’t no one but you deceived
Your sympathy is soon to leave

And now hide your mouth before you speak
Better yet just turn a cheek
Watch your interest growing weak
But still you say that I’m the freak
And I guess that’s fine with me"

Y dentro un manzano

para refugiarme
en su sombra en verano
con la guitarra
pues no cabe un piano.

Un metro cuadrado
sembrado de hierba,
sembrado de hierba.
Y en él recostarme
un poco encogido,
rozando la piedra.

Un libro en las manos
con estampas viejas
y su canto dorado,
Cuentos de Calleja.
Se escucha el cuclillo
oculto en la parra.
Un cri-cri acompaña
su canto sencillo,
son hermano grillo
y hermana cigarra.

Sobre mi cabeza
se ve el cielo mío,
todo el cielo propio
y podré mirarlo
sin pedir permiso,
sin pedir permiso,
con un telescopio.

de mi propia tierra
hasta el fondo adentrado,

""Can You Hear Me""

[Chorus]
Cuz now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some diffrent shit
Cuz you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And Im your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with alot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer thats doing a state biddin
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
Who started going on about how he moving on
About running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
And it's fucked up

[Chorus - 2X]"
74,MY EARLY MUSTANG,Samantha,TRBTILZ128F426ABC6,2004,"She told me that she can't deny her,
She's always calling me a liar
Just took my hand and made it out for
That girl standing in the corner
That night we dreamt of pulling over
Instead of options going nowhere
She couldn't find about an answer
Just how sweet she is, how sweet she is..

And i can't help, 
But she's a liar to herself
I can't talk, i can't see
Believe in me

Samantha, Samantha
Tell the boys that you really really love her
Samantha's home 
Samantha please let go

All her friends were calling her a rockstar
She couldn't find a place to stay her
Right here is all she ever wanted
Couldn't go back, go back and just get it
She seeked a spot to contemplate it
Couldn't help but always go betray him 
Patiently waiting for solution 
She should have waited, should have waited"

As quiet as a whisper
In your head
Pain can be
So silent you won't even
Know it's there
If rage could be
So soft
I might stay here
With you
If you could see my heart
It might turn
Your eyes to blue

But I've gotta let you go
It's harder to learn than
It is to know
I wanna see you fly
It's easier to hurt
Than to say goodbye
It's easier to hurt
Than to say goodbye

God is as good

As he is kind
As he is just
He knows just how I feel
Ashes to Ashes
Dust to Dust
But I want a bigger cup
This one won't hold enough
A love and painted heartache
And other fancy stuff

But I've gotta let you go
It's harder to learn than
It is to know
I wanna watch you fly
It's easier to hurt
Than to say goodbye
It's easier to hurt
Than to say goodbye

It's gonna hurt
When I say goodbye"

Ask me to dance with you tonight
Just ask me for my love

I want to hide
What's deep in my eyes
I'm scared to be known by you
But when I turn my head
And see you there
I want to be pursued

Gaze into my eyes

Thousands, for my love
Slip your hand in mine
Ask me to dance with you tonight
Just ask me for my love

A story that will never end

When I heard you say
I love you
And it doesn't feel quite the same
Going through the day
Without your loving arms to ease the pain
I would surely go insane
But I know we're gonna be with love again

Though you may be far away
And I have is yesterday
I can't stop the world from turning
Only you can stop the hurting
Though you may be far away
Time and space will not erase
The look of pain upon your face
Said everything you could not say
I know as sure as I breathe
Love will always bring you back to me

If I had to fall in love again
I wouldn't hesitate
If it was with you
But love's story had to go and change
One thing remains
I will never be in love this way again
You know my heart's with you
Even when I can't be next to you

Though you may be far away
And I have is yesterday
I can't stop the world from turning
Only you can stop the hurting
Though you may be far away
Time and space will not erase
The look of pain upon your face
Said everything you could not say
I know as sure as I breathe
Love will always bring you back to me

I knew life would never be the same
Though my nights are long
I keep holding on
Sometimes I feel just like a child again
When I;ve lost control
Yet I know
That as sure as I breathe
Love will always bring you back to me

Though you may be far away
And I have is yesterday
I can't stop the world from turning
Only you can stop the hurting
Though you may be far away

I woke up to the sound of the garbage truck again
Upstairs neighbors toilet is leaking on my head
My car's broke down I missed the bus that runs at ten
I had a feeling this was a day to stay in bed
I finally left my pad right under Jumbo's clown room
A police officer pulled out his gun and said, &amp;quot;freeze, put your hands up&amp;quot;
I said, &amp;quot;sir you got the wrong guy&amp;quot;
I guess it's just a perfect day
It's just a perfect day
I'm sippin' a Fresca at the downtown county jail
My friends are all too broke to come up with my bail
I lost my day shoes to Tiny playing spades
I'm sleeping with one eye open to make sure I don't get laid
Vaye te petras hay a la chingada
The deportation officer he said to me
They put us on a bus to Guadalajara
I guess it's just a perfect day
It's just a perfect day
Have you ever, ever had one of those days
When it seems nothing's right nothing's going your way
It's all wrong I dedicate this song
To you, you and you and whoever relates to what we do
But somebody tell me why, why, why
This always happens to me, me, me
Just another dose of reality
Just trying to make the best of this situation
This really isn't my idea of vacation
Oh my, my mamacita say
Hey baby vaminos a me

Meet up with the sunlight
Can't fight it can't buy it

We're not immune to addiction or disease

justify their unworthy unrighteous behavior. Terror is based on beliefs and false hope. 
War is based on books about tales and myths. Freedom died when humanity started 
reading the holy books and started creating symbols to justify their insecurity about 
things they can't explain. We have to overcome this urge and accept that we can not 
know everything. They should fear the revenge and not hope for forgivingness."

Holy water
Shining like a silver flame
Come like a ghost
I will watch you dance alone
Mi morena
You're the light within my soul

And so my love
The way you're moving in your dress
To a nylon guitar
On wings of silk and lace
You lift upon the notes and slip away

Mi morena
I saw you dancing in the rain
Holy water
Shining like a silver flame
Come like a ghost
I will watch you dance along
Mi morena
You're the light within my soul

Take this cross of feathers and bone
Take this heart I've carved in stone
In your name

Where the setting sun surrenders to the moon
Mi querida
I wait for you

Be my lover
I will fall into your eyes

For you I'd steal the stars

96,Scary Bitches,I Was the Devil's Child,TRTUWOF128F4256E09,2004,"I was born one Monday morning
when the sun refused to shine
My mother took one look and said
That ain't no child of mine

She cried what have I done
Please forgive me mighty god
The other children cried for milk
Mine barks like a dog

I was the devil's child
I was the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

The day that I was born
The gypsee woman said
With all those dirty(?) diapers
Your gonna need some more cloth pegs
Then she looked into the cradle
And her eyes they filed with fear
She said my god what have you done
I'm getting out of here
She cried the devil is born to Earth
She began to scream and shout
And everyone ignored her
And security threw her out

I was the devil's child
I was the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

I grew some little fangs
Just like a little rat
I wanted blood not milk
And I got it from your cat
The virus spreads as she infected every cat around
Now everyone's a vampire in our little town

I was the devil's child
I was the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

When the goverment found out
They tried to close us down
They wiped us up the map and put
And a fence around the town
The top of the exclusion zone
Guarded by men with guns
Now no one's either in or out of area 51

I was the devil's child
I was the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

Here's a warning to all you women
And all you young girls to
If you have sex with Satan
A vampire will be born to you
While fences all have holes in
Where small things can get through
Now we're breeding vampire spiders
And we're sending them after you

I am the devil's child
A am the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

I am the devil's child
I am the devil's child
A blood sucking fucking demon
Just running wild

A blood sucking fucking demon"

i've got something to say to you
it's not so elusive this golden frontier

sometimes you get marooned
with salt in every wound
you watch as your own hands
reach for the nightstand
for something to bring you down

look up my friend, the dead will soon ascend
but everyone's even
when the light fades away

pull over to the shoulder
i've got something to say to you

Remember all that has
Brought us here to stay
And don't fear
The face of change it will heal
And help deal with the pain

Finding out that you're just a lamb of rot, No one cares in this world of god forgot,
His belief in us long been said and gone, in our age where there is no fear of god,
I forsake you and I hate you holy one give us life just to take it when were done.

Behead you with the bible, the book of god and failing son,
There is no resurrection for god has left us to Satan,
Reach out in desperation receive his empty words of love,
Revel in mans creation; the light of god has turned to shit.

Mad at god for the things he's done to me, for this life of regrets and his agony,
In his name I do blame and wish his death, all my life has been pain and nothing else,
Curse you god for the life you left me with, Everyday is a fight to want to live,
Cross of Christ I despise and hate the lord, Mad at god for the world he has ignored.
My life is not religion, salvation or his bastard son, 
Annihilate the bible; remove it from this world at once,
In total desecration, the house of god has been destroyed,
At last the truth will triumph, free will and blasphamation.

I hate you lord, forgot I exist, resent your ways that will not be forgived,
Waller in hatred I blame you for all, slashing and stabbing your Christians I maul,
Mad at god revenge in my heart wanting you dead will never depart,
When I was born, marked with your cross, only to suffer and deal with my loss,
Dead in my thoughts prey to myself, not to show mercy for nobody else,
I am for me, need not from god, my heart is stone and will never be loved.
Mad at god and mad at you, believing in something that cannot be true,
Think for yourself, free from his lies, trample the cross and smash Jesus Christ.
Die!!!!!!!!!!!
Mad At god!!!!! Mad At god!!!!!Mad At god!!!!!!Mad at god!!!!!!

My life is not religion, salvation or his bastard son, 
Annihilate the bible; remove it from this worldat once,

103,Vitamin X,Bad Trip,TRHCIHZ128F4277C40,2004,"Elimination?, eradication?
What we need is regulation!
War on drugs; a bunch of lies
And we're the ones who pay the price

Society makes me fucking sick
That's why I'm on a Bad Trip

Millions of people behind bars
Government's fighting a civil war
Dealers, (drug)lords, gangs and crime
This policy fucking blows my mind

Song about our fucked up society in general,
And this ridiculous war on drugs.
World governments have spent hundreds of
Billions of dollars trying to make the world
'drug-free'. Yet heroin, cocaine, etc. are
Cheaper, purer and easier to get than ever
Before. The rates of death, disease, crime and
Addiction have skyrocketed. The war on drugs
Is also a war on race and gender; millions of
People are behind bars on minor drug charges
(like smoking a joint) especially women and
People of color.
The average sentence in the US for a first time,
Non-violent drug offender is LONGER than
The average sentence for rape, manslaughter,
Bank robbery or child molestation!!!
This is totally insane! People should not be
Punished for what they put into their bodies,
But only for crimes committed against others.
What we need is education and regulation!"

Para una carta unas cuantas palabras
Alguien para admirar
Para un amigo un simple regalo
Pero un regalo bien pensado

Otra vez me atrevo a cantar

He closed his eyes and took the leap
The afternoons where mothers weep
For frozen lakes and fallen leaves
Safe inside his tree house dreams
Forsakes his plans
Forgets his schemes
The wicked whisper from the sea
This is the night you come with me

Time is passing by
A ship comes in
It sails tonight

When all the lights parade the air
Like carousels at summer fairs
Beware the stare of ghost house eyes
The wicked whispers in the night
Still it's ringing in his mind
So hard to touch, so hard to find
In tree house dreams, he still go waits
And seven seas to seal his fate

Time is passing by
A ship comes in
It sails tonight

Time is passing by
A ship comes in
It sails tonight

Yes time has passed him by
His ship came in
It sailed last night"

I leave you without hesitation

I fill the tank of this dirty car up
I go without direction, Lilly
I will end up anywhere

The rubber struggle and the lack of space
So serious and horny faces
After we came I realised it
This car is a comedy
I can't help laughing about it
I pass the parking lot where we made love
I loose you in an accident

Pintado de escarlata
Una moneda en el mar

Y estoy sufriendo porque
Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame
Esa mujer, esa mujer se fue, esa mujer

El eco de tu voz y tus palabras
Aun sigue aquí
Las huellas de tu paso por la casa
Las llevo en mí

Y el aire tan sutil de tu perfume
Que vive entre los pliegues de mi cama
Me embriaga amor
Me arrastra amor, me mata

Ah, desde que no estás aquí
Desde el principio del fin
Voy recorriendo las calles rodando
Y rodando buscando tu luz

Desde que no estás aquí
Desde que no se vivir
Parece que el tiempo vuela
Y nada consuela mi llanto por ti

Una mañana sin sol
Un día sin minutos
Una verdad sin razón
Así fue nuestro amor

Y estoy sufriendo porque
Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame, esa mujer
Esa mujer se fue, esa mujer
Esa mujer que ame, esa mujer

La luna no entrara por la ventana
Si tú no estás, seré como una estrella
Que se apaga, sí tu no estas

Ya nunca sonreirá la madurada

Du bist der Glanz in meinen verheulten Augen.
Du bist der Grund an mich zu glauben.
Doch das Beste an dir ist,
dass du mir so ähnlich bist.

Du schaust in den Spiegel
und willst, dass er zerbricht.
Warum sind da Tränen in deinem Gesicht?

Was ich an dir mag,
kannst du vielleicht nicht leiden.
Doch ich denk' jeden Tag,
du sollst genau so bleiben.
Und jetzt komm an meine Seite.
Ich will mich überall mit dir zeigen,
denn das was ich an dir hab,
ist was ich an dir mag.

Ich bin das Wasser, auf dem du gehen kannst.
Ich bin das Seil, auf dem du tanzt.
Ich bin die Luft, die du atmest
und die Rakete, mit der du startest.

Ich bin das Netz, dass dich nie fallen lässt.
Und wenn du Sterne siehst, dann halt dich an mir fest.
Du bist das Drehen in meinem Bauch
und ich weiß, du fühlst es auch.

Du bist mein fester Wille,
von jetzt bis irgendwann.
Der Puls in meinen Adern,

You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky

118,JUNIUS,Hiding Knives,TRZFGMK128F92D5C5E,2004,"Stepped outside and I walked to the edge
Toes pointing down looking over the past again
I'm frightened by my urge to descend
Opened up my chest many times before
To the knife of love to the best unborn
I swore out to the night
And felt myself begin to lean in
 
Spinning out around around
Descending on a forming crowd
Of sullen eyes hiding knives
Spinning out around around
They're looking twice and slowing down
I really doubt I'll make out alive

Layed out next to my still beating heart
I've fallen down inside a caustic crowd
They slip and fall when blood it pours out
They suck it up but it won't decay
It beats for hours it bleeds for days
Their sullen lives, numbing nights
Holding on to murmurs for dear life

We can fall forever
Filling the night sky
Feelings that won't die
A rush of warm blood
We can fall forever
Holding hands in silent flight
Coping with loss and love's lies
We can fall forever
Holding on to nice tries
Rushing towards the fine lines
Crawl in my life"
119,John Butler Trio,Betterman (full-length/album version),TRKEXEH128F42443C7,2004,"So better man I am since I
Come into contact with you
And you taught so many things about myself
And you know this is true
But now we are apart and it's all my fault
'Cos you know I need to be alone
Don't know myself
So how can I share me with you girl or anyone

Don't want to be a thorn in your side
Good woman
Always be the one
To make you cry
Don't wanna be that guy
Good woman
'Cos you deserve everything
And I got nothing so leave me
And I'll go away better off I stay
Far from you, you, you, you, you
Because you are beautiful

Beautiful woman

Now typical man
I am because you think
I want my cake and eat it too
'Cos say I can't be in a relationship
But I still feel for you
'Cos you are the best woman
This old man has ever met
You taught me about my soul 
You shared with me your magic

Don't want to be a thorn in your side
Good woman
Always be the one
To make you cry
Don't wanna be that guy
Good woman
'Cos you deserve everything
And I got nothing so leave me
And I'll go away better off I stay
Far from you, you, you, you, you, you
Because you are beautiful

Better man I am since I
Come into contact with you
And you taught
So many things about myself
And you know this is true
But now we are apart and it's all my fault
'Cos you know I need to be alone
Don't know myself
So how can I share me with you girl
Or anyone
'Cause you are

Beautiful beautiful beautiful woman
Better man I am 'cos of you"
120,Xandria,Eversleeping,TRVQXLC128F9307C19,2004,"Once I traveled 7 seas to find my love.
And once I sang 700 songs.
Well, maybe I still have to walk 7000 miles,
Until I find the one that I belong.

I will rest my head side by side,
To the one that stays in the night.
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow.

And whatever comes will come soon,
Dying I will pray to the moon,
That there once will be a better tomorrow.

Once I crossed 7 rivers to find my love,
And once, for 7 years, I forgot my name.
Well, if I have to I will die 7 deaths just to lie,
In the arms of my eversleeping aim.

I will rest my head side by side,
To the one that stays in the night.
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow.

And whatever comes will come soon,
Dying I will pray to the moon,
That there once will be a better tomorrow.

I will rest my head side by side,
To the one that stays in the night.
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow.

And whatever comes will come soon,
Dying I will pray to the moon,
That there once will be a better tomorrow.

I dreamt last night, that he came to me,
He said; ""My love, why do you cry?
For now it won´t be long any more,
Until in my cold grave we will lie.""

Until in my cold grave we will lie."

Your disguise, let the pure rip all your deflecation.
YOU. You look at me
YOU. You look at me
You know that you're done for coming
YOU. You look at me
YOU. You look away
When you blink your eyes I will unvail

Fist to the face, tell me, how does your blood taste?
Fist to the face, tell me, how do you like this?
Fist to the face, tell me, how does your blood taste?
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face.

I will describe all the pain that I will bring apon you.
Look in my eyes, I've begun, see? Destroy all your vision
YOU. You run away
YOU. You run away
You can't run away, you coward.
YOU. You run away
YOU. You face him
You will face him when you're in the ground

Fist to the face, tell me, how does your blood taste?
Fist to the face, tell me, how do you like this?
Fist to the face, tell me, how does your blood taste?
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face.

Maybe I've seen truth. I know we can save the world
I will do my part. So let's get started.
Say what you meen. Meen what you say.
Throw your fist in the air. It's just begining.

Sweep the broken fist of God.
Faith in shall die.
Sweep the broken fist of God
Faith in shall die.
Can't run away"

all's quite now on the western front
but you never know what's above you
chances are when you're down and tired
it's a lack of what you need inside you

so they say if you play their game
well you'll never have much to lose
it's the life they chose and and if you're one of those
well you'll never have much to prove

looking up
looking out

so you claim that you're not the same
it's just a dead end old part of town
why pan for gold when the water's cold
you might as well lay face down and drown

then you play their game yet you cry for change
and you always seem to miss your turn
you let them make your bed rest your weary head
on a mattress that's been set to burn

looking up
looking out
reaching in
let it out

that will never be me
i will always be free
that will never be me
i will always be free

looking up
looking out
reaching in
let it out

looking up
looking out
reaching in
let it out

that will never be me
i will always be free
that will never be me
i will always be free

raise your heads
open eyes
smash down walls
see the lies
see the lies
see the lies
see the lies"
123,Cult Of Luna,White Cell,TRDCHFC12903CF5E16,2004,"Where is the rain that purifies and retaliates?
Where is the one I begged for strength to carry on?
Speak to me, I have followed through
Deliver me from guilt, take me home

To the source of white light, I offer my place
My sacrifice for its life
The guilt that stains me vanishes on the other side

Where is the rain that purifies and retaliates?
Where is the one I begged for strength to carry on?
Walking along the river's flow
A journey away from original sin

You and I merge, we become one"
124,Scars Of Tomorrow,Reflections (Album Version),TRZESFN128F422F1B3,2004,"Taken away
To a time and place that brings you peace
That clears your mind
You're changed by a shard of glass
Impaled by grief

Reflections
Reflections
Of a past that you can't forget
Reflections
Reflections
Of a time you can't forget

You saw your tortured past come to an end
Here comes your end
Forsake your life

Reflections
Reflections
Of a past that you can't forget
Reflections
Reflections
Of a time you can't forget

You saw your clouded past
Flash before your eyes
Forsake your life
Brainwashing you

Your reasons for leaving
Your breaking this evening
And you saw the pain that you hide inside
And you damn the day

Nothing to prove, nothing to say
Nothing to loose, nothing to gain
Nothing to feel, nothing to hate
Nothing is real, it's all too late
What do you do when nothing's wrong
Ain't got a clue, ain't got no song

You are foaming at the mouth, you are mad without a doubt
'Cause I'm really freaking out
And I'm going out of my mind, TV got me going blind
And I'm really freaking out

Hey man, you think you got it made
Grooving and you stink on your fender bass
Got on your aviators shades
Yeah man, you're looking really ace
So what the hell you're doing here
Filling the space between my ears
Why don't you all just disappear
With all your friends just way too dear

You are foaming at the mouth, you are mad without a doubt
'Cause I'm really freaking out
And I'm going out of my mind, TV got me going blind
And I'm really freaking out

Nothing to see, nothing to hear
Nothing to be, nothing to fear
Nothing to prove, nothing to say

With one you love, the sun above waiting for the moon 
The old accordian playing a sentimental tune 
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon 
The birds above all sing of love, a gentle sweet refrain 
The winds around all make a sound like softly falling rain 
Just two of us together, we'll plan a honeymoon 
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon"

Where you can watch me undress 
I want to lay with you in the water 
Naked, floating on sunlight 

Float away with me 

Float away with me 

And in the waterfall, I explore you 
I want to be your temptress 
And as the cool cascade washes over 
we fall into fire 

Float away with me (x6) 

With me (x4) 

Float away with me 

Float away with me (x4)"

dream awake eyes open wide
drain the poison kill the lie
life is now there is no end
never know what might have been

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave
spirit never fade 
never fade away
spirit never fade 

things that you fear the most
the same damn things you hold close
try hard as steel till nothing's left
it'll come when you least expect

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave
spirit never fade 
never fade away
spirit never fade 

in your mind suspended in time
different lives different times
worls collide memory blinds
peace is hard to find
spirit or ghost
have i lost my mind
hope is alive
carry us through time

dream awake eyes open wide
drain the poison kill the lie
life is now there is no end
never know what might have been

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave

spirit never fade 
never fade away

My fear is gone
And I feel so strong

And whatever you need, I will provide you
Take my side, and never let go

And I give just for you
And your love has me wanting to
Be the best man I can be

Just for you and me

To a future filled with truth and trust
And your sweet touch
I want you so much
And there is nothing that we can't do together
I am gonna be lovin' you forever
Take my hand, and make me your man

If I'm a few hours late, whats the harm
I've been in Mexico, I've been to Mexico
I discovered how to take it slow
I've been in Mexico

Now the boss is stressed out, he's got his deadlines to meet
I'm leaning back in my chair with my two bare feet
I've been in Mexico, oh Mexico
Still got the sun on my back and the sand in my toes
I've been in Mexico

And when I landed in the land of the Aztec sun
I was too uptight, too high strung
But the moment that salt air hit my tongue
I felt a change, nobody ever goes and comes back the same

When she left me for another I was down and out
But there's a little cactus cure I've learned about
I've been in Mexico, oh Mexico
And to that heartache I say adios
I've been in Mexico

And when I landed in the land of the Aztec sun
I was too uptight, too high strung
But the moment that salt air hit my tongue
I felt a change, nobody ever goes and comes back the same

So take my sunglasses with you, leave your watch behind
Could you please tell Maria ""I'm doin' fine""
I've been in Mexico, oh Mexico"

From the basement,
Spitting out words like bullets from a gun

Shut our shows down
But we won't stop now
Whatever you do - It's no use!

Three chord punk
Is my release, the only way out

You can try, try to fight us
Shut our shows down
Make us go underground
Whatever you do - It's no use!"

Karlı dağlarında doğamam ki

Çok üzülme, çok susma
  Çok terleme, çok susma
  Çok da kitap okuma     dedi annem
 
Çok terleme çok yorulma
  Girdaplarında boğulma
  Yalnızlığına da çok alışma

Güneşim olmaden göremem ki
Ay tutulurken uyuyamam ki
Karanlık olsa da
Ben herkesi sevemem ki
Sevmeden de yaşayamam ki
Yanlış olsa da"
