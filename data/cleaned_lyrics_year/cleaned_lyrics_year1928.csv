Stay away from me 'cause I'm in my sin.
If this place gets raided, it's just me and my gin.

Don't try me nobody, oh, you will never win.
Don't try me nobody 'cause you will never win.
I'll fight the army, navy just me and my gin.

Any bootlegger sure is a pal of mine.
Any bootlegger sure is a pal of mine.
'Cause a good ol' bottle o' gin will get it all the time.

When I'm feeling high ain't nothing I won't do.
When I'm feeling high ain't nothing I won't do.
Get me full of liquor and I'll sure be nice to you.

I don't want no pork and I don't need no beer.
I don't want no pork and I don't need no beer.
I don't want no porkchop just give me gin instead."""
1,Big Bill Broonzy,Big Bill Blues,TRHYOOF12903CE46EB,1928,"Lord, my hair's a rising
My flesh begins to crawl
Aw, my hair's a rising
My flesh begin to crawl
I had a dream last night, baby
Another mule in my doggone stall

Now there's some people said
The Big Bill blues ain't bad
Now some people said
The Big Bill blues ain't bad
Lord, it must not have been them
Big Bill blues they had

Lord, I wonder what's the matter
Papa Bill can't get no mail
Lord, wonder what's the matter now
Papa Bill can't get no mail
Lord, the post office must be on fire
The mailman must undoubtedly be in jail

I can't be a wagon
Since you ain't gonna be a mule
Can't be a wagon, mama
Since you ain't gonna be a mule
I ain't gonna fix up your black tradition
I ain't gonna be your doggone fool"

3,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Prison Cell Blues,TRGBHIB128F427E183,1928,"Gettin' tired of sleepin' in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it hadn't have been for Nell

Lay awake at night and just can't eat a bite
Used to be my rider but she just won't treat me right

Got a red-eyed captain and a squabblin' boss
Got a mad-dog sergeant and, honey, and he won't knock off

I'm gettin' tired of sleepin' in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it hadn't have been for Nell

I asked the government to knock some days off my time
By the way I'm treated I'm 'bout to lose my mind

I wrote to the governor to please turn me a-loose
Since I didn't get no answer I know it t'ain't no use

I'm gettin' tired of sleepin' in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it hadn't have been for Nell

I hate to turn over and find my rider gone
Walked across my floor, lordy, how I moaned

Well, I wouldn't have been here if it hadn't have been for Nell
I'm gettin' tired of sleepin' in this lowdown lonesome cell"
4,Blind Lemon Jefferson,How Long How Long,TRIJPWN128F4236299,1928,"How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?
For how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

Standin' at the station, watch my baby leave town
I feel disgusted, no peace can be found
For how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

I can hear the whistle blowing but I just can't see no train
Way down in my heart, baby, there lie aches of pain
Oh, how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

Sometime I feel disgusted and I feel so blue
I hardly know what in this world, baby, a good man can do
For how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

If I could holler just like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain, I'd call my baby back
For how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

Some day you're gonna be sorry you ever done me wrong
It'll be too late darlin', your man'll be gone
For how long, ah, how long, baby, how long

My mind goes to wondering, I feel so sad
Thinking about the trouble a good man always had
Oh, how long, ah, how long, baby, how long"

Motherless children have a hard time, mother's dead
They'll not have anywhere to go, wanderin' around from door to door
Have a hard time

Nobody on earth can take a mother's place when, when mother is dead, Lord
Nobody on earth takes mother's place when, mother's dead
Nobody on earth takes mother's place,
When you were startin', paved the way
Nobody treats you like mother will when
Your wife or husband may be good to you, when mother is dead, Lord
They'll be good to you, mother's dead
A wife or a husband may be good to you,
But, better than nothing has proved untrue
Nobody treats you like mother will when, when mother is dead, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Yeah, well, ah

Well, some people say that sister will do, when mother is dead
That sister will do when mother's dead
Some people say that sister will do,
But, as soon as she's married, she turn her back on you
Nobody treats you like mother will
And father will do the best he can, when mother is dead, Lord
Well, the best he can when mother is dead
Father will do the best he can,
So many things a father can't understand
Nobody treats you like mother will

A motherless children have a hard time, when mother is dead, Lord
Motherless children have a hard time, mother's dead
They'll not have anywhere to go,
Wanderin' around from door to door
Have a hard time"

7,Blind Willie Johnson,If I Had My Way I'd Tear The Building Down,TRJLNHE128F426D6C3,1928,"Well, if I had my way
I had-a, a wicked mind
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down 

Weh-ell!
Delilah was a woman fine an' fair
Her pleasant looks-a, her coal black hair
Delilah gained old Samson's mind
A-first saw the woman that looked so fine

A-well went Timnathy, I can't tell
A daughter of Timnathy, a-pleased him well  
A-Samson told his father, 'I'm goin a-a-a'
(Help) me Lord

If I had my way
Well, if a had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down  

Weh-ell!
Samson's mother replied to him
'Can't you find a woman of your kind and kin?'
'Samson, will you please your mother's mind?'
Go'd and married that-a Philistine

Let me tell you what, old Samson

Well, he roared at the lion, the lion run
Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

If I had my way
If I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

'Well, your riddle please, a-tell it to me'
'A-how an eater became forth meat?'
'Well, your riddle please, a-tell it to me'
'A-how strong of it came forth sweet?
Deliah, got his army after him
Well, the bees made-a honey in the lion hair

Well, if I had my way
Well, if I had-a, a wicked world
If I had-a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

Lord, If I had my way
Well, if I had a, a wicked world
If I had a, ah Lord, tear this building down

Weh-ell!
Samson's trick though they never found out
'Till they began to wonder about
A-'till his wife sat up upon his knee
'A-tell me where your strength lie, if you please?'

Samson's wife she a-talked so fair
Told his wife cut off-a his hair
'Shave my head, clean as your hand
'Till I become a natural man!'

Lord, If I had my way
Well, if I had a, a wicked world
If I had a, ah Lord, tear this building down."
8,Blind Willie McTell,Three Women Blues,TRFLSMH12903CE7130,1928,"Got three womens
Yellow, brown and black
I got three womens
Yellow, brown and black

It'll take the Governor of Georgia
To judge one of these women I like

One for in the morning
One for late at night
One for in the morning
One for late at night

I got one for noontime
To treat your old daddy right

These blues at midnight
They don't leave me till day
These blues at midnight
They don't leave me till day

I didn't have none of my three women
To drive these blues away

One is a Memphis yellow
The other is a Savannah brown
One is a Memphis yellow
The other is a Savannah brown

One is a Statesboro dark skin
She'll really turn your damper down

Now if I had listen
To what my three women said
Now if I had listen
To what my three women said

I'd aâ€‘been home sleeping
In a doggone feather bed"

Have you got the nerve to drive Papa McTell from your door?

My mother died and left me reckless, my daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
Mother died and left me reckless, Daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
No, I'm not good lookin', but I'm some sweet woman's angel child

She's a mighty mean woman, to do me this a-way
She's a mighty mean woman, to do me this a-way
When I leave this town, pretty mama, I'm going away to stay

I once loved a woman, better than I ever seen
I once loved a woman, better than I ever seen
Treat me like I was a king and she was a dog-gone queen

Sister, tell your Brother, Brother tell your Auntie, Auntie, tell your Uncle,
Uncle tell my Cousin, Cousin tell my friend
Goin' up the country, Mama, don't you want to go?
May take me a fair brown, may take me one or two more

Big Eighty left Savannah, Lord, and did not stop
You ought to saw that colored fireman when he got that boiler hot. You can
Reach over in the corner, Mama, and hand me my travelin' shoes
You know by that, I've got them Statesboro blues

Brother got 'em, friend got 'em, I got 'em
Woke up this morning, we had them Statesboro blues
I looked over in the corner,
Grandma and Grandpa had 'em too."

I'm feeling awful bad
I got the dark night blues
Mama, I'm feeling awful bad
That's the worst ol' feeling
That a good man have ever had

I followed my brown
From the depot to the train
I followed my fair brown
From the depot to the train
And the blues came down
Like dark night showers o' rain

I drink so much whiskey
I stagger when I'm sleep
Drink so much whiskey
I stagger when I'm sleep
My brains are dark and cloudy
My mind's gone to my feet

I got the blues so bad
I can feel them in the dark
I got the blues so bad
I can feel them in the dark
And one dark and dreary morning
Baby, when you broke my heart

I got a fair brown in Atlanta
Got one in Macon too
I got a fair brown in Atlanta
Got one in Macon too
I got one in Statesboro
Give me them old dark night blues

Everything I told you
Went and told your outside man
Everything I told you
Mama, you went and told your outside man
But I want to tell you something
Your good man can't stand

Say you didn't want me
I'ma quit hanging around"

Don't you think your fairer was li'l and cute like mine

She's a mar- She's a married woman,
But she comes to see me all the time

Don't you never let one woman rule your mind

The world is done gone away
I'm got a bad luck deal
Give me trouble every day

And I'm going, I'm going
Pin up black tape on your door
Tell your man ain't dead
Just ain't coming to your house no more

And I'm going downtown
Going to stay around there till dark
I don't want no trouble
Don't want you to drive off

Now when you lay down at night
Lit out early try to take your rest
You'll get a couple phone calls
Wake up and try to do your best

I'm got a gal in the country
I'm got two that stays in town
Reason I can fill it so careful
Because nar' of them don't throw me down"
13,Furry Lewis,Kassie Jones (Part 2),TRZCMFI128F933E6A8,1928,"Part 1:

I woke up this mornin', four o'clock.
Mister Casey told his fireman, get his boiler hot.
Put on your water, put on your coal.
Put your head out of the window, see my drivers roll.
See my driver roll.
Put your head out of the window, see my driver roll.

Lord, some people say that Mister Casey couldn't run.
Let me just tell you what Mister Casey done.
He left Memphis, it was quarter to nine.
Got to Newport News, it was dinnertime.
It was dinnertime.
Got to Newport News, it was dinnertime.

I've sold my gin, I've sold it straight.
Police run me to my woman's gate.
She comes to the door, she nod her head.
She made me welcome to the foldin' bed.
To the foldin' bed.
Made me welcome to the foldin' bed.

Lord, the people said to Casey ""You're runnin' over time.""
""You'll have another 'lision with the one-o-nine.""
Casey said, ""This ain't in mind.
I'll run it in close just to make my time.""
Said to all the passengers, ""Better keep yourself hid
Naturally gonna shake it like Chainey did.""
Like Chainey did.
Naturally gonna shake it like Chainey did.

Mister Casey run his engine within a mile of the place.
Number four stared him in the face.
The depot told Casey, ""Well, you must leave town.""
""Believe to my soul I'm Alabama bound.""
""Alabama bound.""
""Believe to my soul I'm Alabama bound.""

Missus Casey said she dreamt a dream,
The night she bought her sewin' machine.
The needle got broke, she could not sew.
She loved Mister Casey, 'cause she told me so.
Told me so.
Loved Mister Casey, 'cause she told me so.

There was a woman name Miss Alice Fry.
Said, ""I'm gonna ride with Mister Casey 'fore I die.
I ain't good looking but I take my time.
A rambling woman with a rambling mind.
Got a rambling mind.""

Part 2:
Casey looked at his water, water was low.
Looked at his watch, his watch was slow.

On the road again.
Natural born Eastman on the road again.

Lord, there's people tell by the throttle moan,
The man at the fire's Mister Casey Jones.
Mister Casey Jones.

Mister Casey said, before he died,
One more road that he wants to ride.
People tells Casey, ""Which road is he?""
""The Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe.
Santa Fe.""

This mornin' I heard someone was dyin'.
Missus Casey's children on the doorstep cryin'.
Mama, mama, I can't keep from cryin',
Papa got killed on the Southern line.
On the Southern line.
Papa got killed on the Southern line.

""Mama, mama, how can it be?
Killed my father and you weren't the first to grieve?""
""Children, children want you to hold your breath.
Draw another pension from your father's death.
From your father's death.""

On the road again.
I'm a natural born Eastman on the road again.

Tuesday mornin', it looked like rain.
Around the curve came a passenger train.
Under the boiler lay Mister Casey Jones.
Good old engineer, but he's dead and gone.
Dead and gone.

On the road again.
I'm a natural born Eastman on the road again.

I left Memphis to spread the news.
Memphis women don't wear no shoes.
Had it written in the back of my shirt,
Natural born Eastmen don't have to work.
Don't have to work.
I'm a natural born Eastman, don't have to work."
