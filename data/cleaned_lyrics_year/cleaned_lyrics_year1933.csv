0,Bessie Smith,Take Me For A Buggy Ride,TRJVUGM128F9336A17,1933,"You're my man, you're so nice and brown
Sweetest man in this town
I heard you say you was goin' away
And leave me here to stay
I feel like I could cry
And here's the reason why

Daddy, you really know your stuff
When you take me for a buggy ride

I like you when you got your habits on
You can shift your gear with so much pride
I gets a funny feelin'
When you gaze into my eyes
You give me so much thrill
You make my thermometer rise

I'm happy when you're by my side
When you take me for a buggy ride

Daddy, you're as sweet as you can be
When you take me for a buggy ride

When you set me down up on your knee
And ask me to be your bride
When you hug and kiss me
It makes me feel fine
I gets this funny feelin'
Up and down my spine

You don't need no teachin', you don't need no guide
When you take me for a buggy ride

Your lovin' ain't so forte in the park
But you a lovin', poor creature in the dark
You ain't so hot, what can it be
That makes me say? ""Daddy, take all of me""

You always ready every time that I call
What I like about you, you never stall
You ain't no preacher, you a good old soul
You done sent salvation to my very soul

I can't kick but I'm satisfied
When you take me for a buggy ride"
1,Ethel Waters,Stormy Weather,TRGJHUQ128F92FEF7E,1933,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time

I walk around,
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time"
2,Memphis Minnie,Where Is My Good Man,TRDBHZC128F933BDE1,1933,"Lord I wonder where's my good man at
Lord I wonder where's my good man at
He left here this morning didn't carry nothing but his hat

He left his suits all hanging on the rack
He left his suits all hanging on the rack
He left here this morning didn't carry nothing but his hat

Lord I wonder where's my good man at
Lord I wonder where's my good man at
He left here this morning didn't carry nothing but his hat

If only could get my good man back
If only could get my good man back
He left here this morning didn't carry nothing but his hat

Lord I wonder where's my good man at
Lord I wonder where's my good man at
He left here this morning carrying nothing but his hat

Lord if only get my good man back
Lord if only get my good man back
He left here this morning didn't carry nothing but his hat"
