0,CC Cowboys,Tigergutt (Live At Svalbard),TRMHUGD128F426E74A,2007,"Hennes tårer får meg til å tenke
Hennes hud, hennes lukt er i rommet
En vakker stemme hvisker meg i øret
""Tigergutt, kom og ta meg!""
På avstand ser det ut som kjærlighet
På avstand ser det grønt og pent ut
Ingen kriger, ingen knurrer eller biter
Tigergutt- gul og svart

Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Dødsrå, dødsrå
Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Og jeg er redd

Si meg baby, hva har hendt med deg
En ""ja"" dag, åh, tro meg nei
En rødvin og du klyper meg i armen
""Jeg trodde det var no mellom deg og meg""

Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Dødsrå, dødsrå
Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Og jeg er redd

Alle trenger en pistol iblandt, tung og blank
Det bor en liten jævel bak en hjerteklaff

Søndag morgen, jeg står i ruiner
Trill rundt i en noe jeg ikke husker
Jeg er litt redd så jeg lusker meg avgårde
Mens frøken fryd ligger og sover
Nå vil jeg pakke sammen, nå vil jeg langt avsted
Hemmelig nummer, hemmelig adresse
Hennes Tigergutt trenger seg selv
For gjennom en gardin er det ingen som kan se at

Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Dødsrå, dødsrå
Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Og jeg er redd

Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Dødsrå, dødsrå
Hun er så rå, rå, rå
Og jeg er redd"
1,Apoptygma Berzerk,All Tomorrows Parties,TRUZGRK128F424B895,2007,"And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with yesterday's rags
When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties"
2,Cinema Bizarre,Forever Or Never,TRBUELT128F4262B66,2007,"I don´t believe in miracles
I never did
Nothing ever happens here
So sick of it

I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Get-get myself into something new
I´m for something mystical, hysterical,
Dark, intensive, sexual

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
Forever or never

I don´t believe in fairytales
Too cynical
Everybody stop and stare
I let it go

I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Stick-stick-stick out
Just can't be like you

Send myself to outer space
A better place
Gotta win the human race

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
Forever or never

For my love
For my love
For my love, it's forever, forever
For my love
For my love
For my love, it's forever, forever

I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
Forever or never

E-e-eehe e-e-eehe e-e-eehe

We are sisters of the light.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are daughters of sin,
We are laughter in the wind.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are wild, we are free,
Through the darkness, follow me.

I am here,
To break the silence.
And I want you,
To be the voice of mine.

Follow me,
Follow me,
Follow me,
Now.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are daughters of sin,
We are laughter in the wind.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are wild, we are free,
Through the darkness, follow me.

You alone, you can let time stand still.
You create the missing element.

We're the fires of hell,
We're the deep rough sea.
We're the stormy air,
We are we.

We're the ashes of time,
And we are Banshee.
Through the darkness, sisters,
Follow me.

Follow me,
Follow me,
Follow me,
Now.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are daughters of sin,
We are laughter in the wind.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are wild, we are free,
Through the darkness, follow me.

Sisters…
Of the light,
Of the light,
Of the light.

Sisters…
Of the light,
Of the light.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are daughters of sin,
We are laughter in the wind.

Follow me through the night,
We are sisters of the light.
We are wild, we are free,
Through the darkness, follow me.

We are sisters of the light."
4,Blake Lewis,1000 Miles,TRHTUYM128F92C47F3,2007,"Now that it's over
Now that you're not here 
I have to start over
But where to begin
I'm lost inside my head
I can't remember a day without you here
Piecing the puzzle of memories forgotten
And all that was left unsaid

I don't know where your heart is
Don't know if I'm too late
But I will find a way

Can you hear me now through all that the world is screaming
My voice will reach you somehow, somehow
Can you hear me now with every word I'm breathing
When you're a thousand miles away

I knew when I saw you the day that we first met
I'd say anything just to stop your world
Any my love has never left
I didn't have all the answers, didn't know our stories end
But did my words find you then

Can you hear me now through all that the world is screaming
My voice will reach you somehow, somehow
Can you hear me now with every word I'm breathing
When you're a thousand miles away

You always listen to words left hurting
Now's your chance to heal a heart still yearning
You're the best thing that still is happening to me

You always listen to words left hurting
Now's your chance to heal a heart still yearning
You're the best thing that still is happening to me, me, me
I'm still calling

Can you hear me now through all that the world is screaming
My voice will reach you somehow, somehow
Can you hear me now with every word I'm breathing
When you're a thousand miles away

You always listen to words left hurting
Now's your chance to heal a heart still yearning
You're the best thing that still is happening to me, me, me

You always listen to words left hurting
Now's your chance to heal a heart still yearning
You're the best thing that still is happening to me, me, me"
5,Small Sins,On A Mission,TRFTJNM128F4255C2E,2007,"My friend's on a mission,
He;s gonna make 'em pay,
But it's all just for nothing,
He'll do it anyway,
I don't care where you go,
You shouldn't be afraid,
I don't care what you do if it pays.
Thirsty like a diabetic,
Stupid like a pet,
Too much television,
And lack of rest,
I don't care who hit who first,
I couldn't care any less,
I don't care what you do if it's best.
We're all tired all the time"

Tonight we drink, no room for depressing thoughts 
Fill your horns!

Can't you tell when you're making it right
Smarty, yes!

Oo, you think you know ev'ry star up above
Hmmm, that's all you know about
Still, you're in need of a few lessons
Baby, in love, I ain't tellin' ya nothin' wrong

Smarty, can't you see if you had a heart
Ha, ha, you could learn to be twice as smart
Smarty, come here!

9,Robben Ford,How Deep In The Blues (Do You Want To Go),TRWGLHG128F93235C2,2007,"It's none of my business giving advice
You can take it or leave, you don't need to be nice
You're living through hard times and it's starting to show
How deep in the blues do you want to go?

It hasn't been easy living on your own
Got a house full of empty where there once was a home
Tomcats on your doorstep and you never say no
How deep in the blues do you want to go?

Just how far will you go down
Till you lift your head and look around?
You have friends to surround you, baby
And maybe someone who loves you, hey, hey

Taking prescriptions, hide from your pain
Come the next month, baby, it's come back again, oh yeah
Baby, so bad to see you down so low
How deep in the blues do you want to go?

Just how far will you fall
Till you see you just might lose it all?
You have so much to live for, baby
And I wanna show you how, hey, hey

None of my business how you choose to live
But sooner or later something's gonna give
You do what you want but I'd sure like to know
How deep in the blues do you want to go, want to go?
How deep in the blues do you want to go?"
10,Chambao,Lo Bueno Y Lo Malo,TRVBEFQ12903CA9CEA,2007,"(1)
Me paso la vida pensando
en lo bueno y lo malo
mi mente está triste
me siento algo extraña
mi cuerpo se agota, mi alma lo nota
de ver en el mundo
mentiras de otras bocas
la loca envidia que trae la mentira
palabras tan falsas
que por mi mente pasan, hoy pasan.

(2)
El tiempo se pasa, y los años me cansan
me enervan mentiras
que trae gente vana
el tiempo está en vilo
yo sé que me pasa, mentiras, palabras
y todo es una farsa
tengo un momento de ansias mundanas
quisiera decir lo que siento
en mi alma
que la vida pasa, hoy pasa.

(3)
Y en mí, y en mí, y en mí
y en mi mundo nuevo te voy a olvidar (que ya, que ya)
las aventuras que he podido vivir
y en mí, y en mí (que ya, que ya)
no aguanto más historias así
… y en mí

Paso la vida pensando 
que la vida pasa, hoy pasa (x4)"
11,Diorama,EXIT THE GREY,TRTIYBC128F424EA1D,2007,"When they argue endlessly, to conceal that nothing is done.
When I know my faith will falter, without touching anyone.
When I fail to understand, the news they're reading out.
When the rats are taking over the unsinkable.

When their trivial hearts are set, on trivial souvenirs.
When the laughter is getting glamorous, while my lungs are filled with tears.
When the thumbscrews of regret, shut all my systems down.
When mortality is longing to be realized.

Don't tell me to leave my abyss,
Don't tell me to come to the surface.
Don't think there is a way to silence the rupture.

Don't tell me to leave my abyss,
Don't tell me to come to the surface.
Don't think there is a way to silence the rupture;
To exit the grey.

When the veil of ignorance, alights on my ideas.
When nobody pays attention if my nature disappears.
When they put me in the dark, for a verdict without trial.
When my will to breathe is fading in and out.

Don't tell me to leave my abyss,
Don't tell me to come to the surface.
Don't think there is a way to silence the rupture.

Don't tell me to leave my abyss,
Don't tell me to come to the surface.
Don't think there is a way to silence the rupture;
To exit the grey.
To exit the grey."
12,The Last Goodnight,Push Me Away,TRTCROK128F4280D1A,2007,"Why can't you begin to understand?
You're only happy when you're sad and it's killing me
We can talk, we can cry, we can tell each other lies
And call this our goodbye

This is no kind of relationship
It's all stressed, broken, bruised and walking out the door
We can run, we can hide, just look me in the eye
And call this our goodbye

(Chorus)
You push me away for the first time, oh
I can see, this will be just another landslide,
You push me away for the last time
And I'm over it, but in the meantime
You push me away for the last time

Ba da da, Ba da da, Ba da da
Ba da da, Ba da da

Your parade of dishonesty


Has shown me sides of you I never knew and never want to know
We can run, we can fly, I'm just sick of all the lies
This is my goodbye

(Chorus)

This is my break up to you, breaking through you
This is me, broke in pieces, can't you see this?

You push me away for the first time, whoah
I can see, this will be just another landslide

You push me away for the first time, whoah
I can see, this will be just another landslide,
You push me away for the last time
And I'm over it, but in the meantime
You push me away for the last time

I don't want this to be just another landslide
I don't want this to be just another landslide
Just another landslide"

14,Against Me!,New Wave (Album Version),TRXMPZJ128F42846DD,2007,"We can control the medium
We can control the context of presentation
Is there anybody on the receiving end?
Reaching out for some kind of connection

Come on and wash these shores away
Come on and wash these shores away
I am looking for the crest
I am looking for the crest of a new wave

We can be the bands we want to hear
We can define our own generation
Is there anybody on the receiving end?
Are you ready to brave new directions?

Come on and wash these shores away
Come on and wash these shores away
I am looking for the crest
I am looking for the crest of a new wave

Let breathe new dawn, this art is dead
No signs of original thought in the mainstream
Is there anybody on the receiving end?
We can eclipse all that came before us

Come on and wash these shores away
Come on and wash these shores away
I am looking for the crest
I am looking for the crest of a new wave"

Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears

We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realized there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears that we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind

Out of my head, out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad

This is the end
You know

can't deny what's getting wasted 
It's not enough to keep me there 
Even though I stumble down 
It's all for today

I'm getting nervous and pretentious 
A few more things that lead to insanity 
Even though it is obsession 
I guess I'll pick it up for you 

I'm growing tired of little chances
It's not that hard to understand

Every angle seems to be another one in disguise

22,Money Mark,Color Of Your Blues,TRMLMWV128EF342DFB,2007,"Since you've been gone, I've lost my cleverness
And since you've walked away, I just can't deal with this
Loneliness and emptiness
I can't fake it, I feel naked

Wherever I go, people can see, it's in my face
And when I breathe, it's the story of faded glory
Life is made up of all that you lose
Can't even choose the color of your blues

Since you've been gone, I have no eagerness
I live in yesterday's old dusty promises
I believed in what you said
I can't fake it, I feel naked

Where ever I go, people can see, it's in my face
And when I breathe, it's the story of faded glory
Life is made up of all that you lose
Can't even choose the color of your blues

Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Since you've been gone"

A promise should last forever
Right up to the dying embers
Of a fire that burns so slow

It's a different day everyday
Don't want you to walk alone
But how long we carry on
When all of these things have gone

Just promise you will remember
A promise should last forever
It's the last of the dying embers
Of a fire that burns so slowly

It's a beautiful thing to do
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Remember I do love you
Have courage in what you say

Just promise you will remember
Promises last forever
Still left of the dying embers
The fire that burns so slowly

Sometimes you just have to walk away
Sometimes you just have to walk away
Wishing today was yesterday
Yeah, sometimes you just have to walk away"

So listen carefully to every word I say;
I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today

You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
Blackmailed myself
(Cause I ain't got) Cause I ain't got anyone else
This is a stick up
Give us all your inspiration
I've got the red carpet blues, baby

So, put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you,
We're gonna shoot you

And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat, or wallet
That could change just how this goes
No
We're gonna shoot you,
We're gonna shoot you

When I said that I'd return to you, I meant more like a relapse
Now again I think ‘His and her's,’ ‘For better or worse,’
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes

You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
I've got the red carpet blues, baby

So, put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you,
We're gonna shoot you

And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat, or wallet
That could change just how this goes
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat

Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you,
We're gonna shoot you

And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat, or wallet

Do this long enough you get a taste for it

Well, sometimes he do and sometimes he don't
Sometimes I love myself best alone
Do this long enough you get a taste for it

Being trusted and lusted, it could be worse than that

Then I have my job to do and do well
Since you won't give guarantees I'll be cashing out

Do what we can if we're gonna stay

I was a dark house
The shade of a grave
Now to duplicate these extremities
I just call out your name 

And you
You are the latitude

Like any death

In some ways well, maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up
Ah but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might 
Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around
Knock some jerk to the ground
'cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well now what can I say at, the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around
Knock some jerk to the ground
'cause he copped a feel as you walked by

These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed, and botoxed
With deep spray on tans and creamy, lotioney hands
You can't grip a tackle box

These kids are strong never stuck in a rut
If they do there's just a swift kick in the gut
I'll never fear a pistol crack
Cause the Ollie kids always got my back
These city streets are under our boots
With Chicago our home Chicago our roots"

Let me tell you you're the sweetest thing
The love in every song I sing
The music in my ears and everything
Happiness writes white
Maybe that isn't true tonight
And things you know you might forget
And other things I haven't told you yet

Close your eyes
Count to ten
Turn around
Back again
Hit the floor
Then once more
I'm still here

And it's all true
And it's all true

We don't need any kind of big parade
Just this once a little serenade


To celebrate this love we've made
We don't need 
Don't need a big fanfare
This is just my heart laid bare
For anyone who might care

Go away
Round the world
Talk to all kinds of girls
But it's me you won't find
And you're mine

Close your eyes
Count to ten
Turn around
Back again
Hit the floor
Then once more
I'm still here

And it's all true, and it's all true, do you feel it too?
And it's all true, and its all true, tell me do you feel it too?"

Marching side to side
Marching 'cross these fields

we hear these lies
every day and every night
since the time of our infancy

All these invented stories

poisoned by wrong
promises A heart full of
fear to suffer to suffer purgatory

With power and Might this storm wind is blowing
Tear down the Christian monuments in this night
Take hold of our trembling Enemies bodies
Fear the force of this pagan storm

But time is coming
and the first free thought
is running trough your head
But deep in you heart
you can feel something
is wrong with this story

In ancient times this wind was born
grows up again, to a storm
We ride on its wings and fly through the night
together we stand and we fight

With power and Might this storm wind is blowing
Tear down the Christian monuments in this night
Take hold of our trembling Enemies bodies
Fear the force of this pagan storm"

Sky is open wide like father's arms
Ship's sinking in your mother's tears
Dreaming of fortune as many before
Having it all planned in the back of your mind
Ready for some change, taking the challenge
Of making today the steps of tomorrow

Ever rising hope's catching all the souls
Taking them away on a trip far from home
In a big city, in a foreign land
Learning life again
Walking on the western ground

Souvenirs have their own language
Distances aren't what they seem
when you're on your own you're never alone
Phantoms of the past are still haunting the place
Luck and success are paving the way
Engaged in that path there's no turning back

Ever rising hope's catching all the souls
Taking them away on a trip far from home
In a big city, in a foreign land
Learning life again
Walking on the western ground"

Strange feelings come to my mind,
I love the little way she uses everyone
Then leaves them burning behind.

And I don't care who you are,
She'll make a man outta you
I don't care who you love
She'll kill you when she's through.

She's got an hourglass figure,
Gonna be the death of you.

Praying for her son

Blocked by the governmental wall
We are the scientists inside the lab,
Just waiting for the call
This earthquake weather has got me shaking inside
I'm high up and dry

Hung upon your wall for the world to see

Confess to me, every secret moment
Every stolen promise you believed
Confess to me, all that lies between us
All that lies between you and me

We are the bells that never sing
There is a title we can't win no matter
How hard we might swing

We leave religion

Everyone singing, but she can't seem to smile
They never get past arms length
How could they act like everything is alright?

To cover all the memories that scars leave
She says, ""maybe making me bleed 
Will be the answer that could wash the slate clean""

The storm before the peace

You cut your tiny ties and now you're dangling by a lie

Everybody knows beneath your clothes
Starring at your toes is just a pose
Everybody good knows how hard you blow
Everybody knows

You think you're Jesus Christ
You're not my Jesus Christ"
68,Zita Swoon,I Feel Alive In the City,TRPYSPV12903CAD369,2007,"I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend
I feel alive and it feels so good
It seems like I never will be blue again
I shake my head and I close my eyes
I concentrate on my lucky stars
Oh I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend

I feel alive in the city
though it's cold and grey
We give each other the best we have
She loves my kisses and I love her cat
I shake my head and I close my eyes
And send a little prayer to
my lucky stars
I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend
I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend

Feel like making my guitar
telling her that I don't pretend
Feel like the whole world trembles
and I love the sounds
The cars are passing and the lights
are flashing it's a joyful town
I feel alive in the city
I feel alive in the city
I feel alive in the city

I remember the days
that where mucky and grey
When the jokes weren't funny
and the melancholy wouldn't go away
When the writers were dull
and not a soul around that would
see you through

I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend
It's spooky when I think
of what I worried about
It seems so unreal now that
I have no doubts
I put my hand on her hips
and I close my eyes
I move on over to my lucky stars
Oh I feel alive in the city
and I love my friend"

You can't bring me down
Your breath will never be the same

Go!

And I don't know whats wrong with me
I wanted to be all the things you need
All the things you need

And now I'm standing here alone
I'm waiting for it all to come and go
All to come and go

Maybe I just had to let it go

Make it up, make it up when you're not around
Bring it up, bring it up did you hear the sound of the sun
Rising from the grounds

Make it up, make it up when you're not around
Bring it up, bring it up do you always wanna be the one
Running from yourself

You!

And nothing's ever as it seems
When all your dreams exist in memories
Exists in memories

And all the trouble takes it's toll
I don't remember all the common goals
All the common goals

Maybe you just have to let me know

Make it up, make it up when you're not around
Bring it up, bring it up did you hear the sound of the sun
Rising from the grounds

Make it up, make it up when you're not around
Bring it up, bring it up do you always wanna be the one
Running from yourself

Your breath is scorched across my face
You can't bring me down
Your breath will never be the same

Go! Go! Go!

It's not you I'm afraid of
Quiet like I am scared of myself
You'd lie with or without me
You'll never need my help

Maybe I just have to let it go
I have to let it go

Make it up, make it up when you're not around
Bring it up, bring it up did you hear the sound of the sun

I can feel my cheap heartbeat

Because you're taking again

You take, you never give

You wanna frame me, but that shit just won't fly

I've learned to treasure each moment of time
You've even taught me how high love can fly
The very thought of you kiss and soar
Even more, even more
My heart is bursting to say even more
You are my smiling sky
You are my sun and my rain, my lost southern snow

And so can you imagine
If you went away
If I should lose you for one precious day
I think I'd cry the biggest teardrops the whole wide world

You woke up all the love inside me
No more hiding

You are the secret
I cannot keep it all to myself
From deep within me
You are the mystery I love to tell

No more my sin, my shame
Since You took all the blame
You gave everything worth having
Just to have me
Now I can move ahead
And take the words You said
And scream them from the mountains
To the thousands

To the way it used to be
You are everything that I lack
You have taken me and made me complete

Un bisou dans le cou, elle s'amuse mieux avec ses jouets
Je suis un homme valable, et pourtant elle préfère les jouets
Je sais faire la cuisine, elle s'en fout tant qu'elle a ses jouets
Je vais dans des musées, tout ce qui l'intéresse c'est ses jouets
Je squatte le canapé, pendant qu'elle joue avec ses jouets
Elle me regarde à peine, en s'amusant avec ses jouets

Je ne sais pas ce qu'elle attend de moi,
Enfermée dans sa chambre à coucher
Quand je l'appelle, elle ne répond pas
J'aimerais discuter d'elle et moi,
Mais derrière la porte les petits bruits ?...
M'indiquent qu'elle est occupée
J'la vois jamais et on vit sous le même toit
Pour s'amuser, elle n'a pas besoin d'moi
Je lui offrirais la lune, si je pouvais,
Mais elle préférerait des piles pour ses jouets

Je lui donne mon amour mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets
J'ai beau faire des efforts, elle me dit qu'elle préfère les jouets
Même à 06h du mat', il est toujours l'heure pour les jouets
Je lui fais à manger, elle n'a jamais faim pour les jouets
Quel genre de réconfort, peuvent bien lui apporter ses jouets
Est-ce qu'elle a des discussions sur la vie avec ses jouets ?
Est-ce qu'elle a des projets pour le futur  avec ses jouets ?
A-t-elle demandé à son père, ce qu'il pense de ses jouets ?
Et quand elle pleure, et qu'elle a peur,
Est-ce qu'elle appelle ses jouets ?

Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Ça fait du bruit ton truc)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce truc ?)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Bon, on va au cinéma ?)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets !

J'aimerai juste être à tes côtés, pour t'épauler
Lorsque tu ?... mes tunes, pense qu'à tes jouets
J'aimerai juste être à tes côtés, te prouver que la pitié
Etait une chose que t'étais pas foutu d'éprouver
Tu m'ignores et tu t'amuses, tu me méprises
Et notre couple traverse, une vraie crise
Tu ne te sens même pas toucher par mes couplets
Tu préfères le plastique froid, de tes jouets

Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Euh, tu veux pas qu'on regarde la télé)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets,
(Ben, on pourrait sortir ce soir)
Mais elle dit qu'elle préfère les jouets !

Packed tight full of rhythm and blues

A soul sensation that you can't control
And you can see I practice what I preach
I'm your rock n roll Jesus
Yes I am

Been a lotta bling-bling but it ain't real
And a lotta new kings but I won't kneel
Sittin' high on a mountain top
Holdin' shop singin' the raw dog blues

Like in old Mississippi's dirty cotton fields
Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels
It's the same song spinning
But the same song's always been true

And I'm gonna take my roll
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm gonna save your soul

89,31Knots,The Salted Tongue,TRDTQWA128F14B0A17,2007,"It's all about the weak and the devastation.
The devil has come for all the details.
Clicking a button so you're free to exhale.

Is it the cursor, the curse or the nerve to burden?
You're stating your case, a conscientious observer.
So preoccupied by the lives colliding, 
Right in your face. It's entertainment exciting. 

But what's worse? To care?
Or to be convinced there's an enemy somewhere?

Like an amateur lust, you were such the criminal.
Oh so mundane, but so subliminal.
You were down in the red staring up at the blackness.
A fixed rate desire that just deducts by the passion.

Feeling the burn, rest assured you are righteous.
The twilight tonight is scarred with stars made of diamonds.

'Cause all of us want to be held and flaunted, 
In the light or the dark by the Holy or haunted.

Are you haunted?
In the light of the dark by the Holy or haunted.

So walk the way of us and dance the false parade.
Come to love denial and the way it makes mistakes.
Delay, delay, delay. Delay the salted tongue.
Forget forbidden tastes, ascend to chemicals.

Delay, delay, delay. Delay the salted tongue.
Forget forbidden tastes, ascend to chemicals.
When the whites of all their eyes are in their hearts of hearts...
Then you may confess, then you may confess."

I can't live without it 
Would die without it

Where she holds him close to her 
And ease his aching head

Give it all a second look

Another love song
But no, god made nothing
Nothing else like you

Aim it straight at my heart

Though in somebody's arms

We're fighting with an army made of one

Like colored birds in a dusty cage,
And the emptiness from which we came,
Will strip us from our father's names.

And there's nothing lost, and nothing gained,
There's nothing different, and nothing's the same,
But while our hearts will stop and start,
Two eyes greet the day,
We'll pay the price we're taught to pay

When all the tears run down you face,
And all thats left is the pressure under grace,
Will you arm your self with a cold metal skin,
So one gets out, and no one gets in.

And there's nothing lost, and nothings gained.
There's nothing different and nothing's the same,
But while our heart will stop and start,
And two eyes greet the day,
We'll  play these game like we're taught to play"

I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale"

You can't keep running away
You mustn't go outside yet

With the skylight in your eyes
Reaching out to gods

How big a hole would it leave
In the surface of the earth

Let's pretend we never met
Let's pretend we're on our own
We live different lives
Until our cover's blown
I push my hand up to the sky
Shade my eyes from the sun
As the dust settles around me
Suddenly nightime has begun

If a plane were to fall from the sky
How big a hole would it leave
In the surface of the earth
The surface of the earth

Come on now
You knew you were lost
But you carried on anyway
Oh, come on now
You knew you had no time
But you let the day drift away

If you lock them all, lock them down.

Wrapped in your precious cloak
spun from gold.
Useless, you're reaching back dead and cold.

This weight you've trusted.
Polished and sacred has you safe, secure.
You lise in soothing sleep.
One flash, it's happened.
A last desperate moment.
Now the weight falls free.
But have you sunk too deep... to breathe?

Your chest is tight, held in death's embrace.
As your eyes lift up, can you see your escape?
One last fleeting glance, at the shine below.
One last freedom chance,
surrendered to the cold.

As you pass another cape
A silent company
On a way without repose

Behind the dunes
And the shifting sands of cinnamon
A lost and lonely pavement
Of unconquered sanctuaries
Of untouched reveries echoing

Like leftovers - dragged through time and memory
Like leftovers - that live on as seasons pass
Like leftovers - never let you go

And all that remains
Is moulded in the last light of the setting sun
And all that is retained
Is nothing but an image without words
And all that is means nothing anymore

Not that it was
Always beautiful
Not that it was
Something to hold dear

But in the end it was
Just another puzzled piece of you
Now you're a martyr seeking nails
To match those precious wounds
Always looking back
Looking back to something that you lack

Like leftovers - that will never let you go
Like leftovers - under the sky of a fallen paradise
Like leftovers - never let you go

And all that remains
Is moulded in the last light of the setting sun
And all that is retained
Is nothing but an image without words
And all that remains doesn't mean anything at all

Like leftovers - dragged through time and memory
Like leftovers - that do not speak no more
Like leftovers - under the sky of a fallen paradise
Like leftovers - that will never let you grown

And all that remains
Is moulded in the last light of the setting sun
And all that is retained
Is nothing but an image without words
And all that remains can be folded in a purse"

All those nights and mornings
Running it down and under

Barefoot on the cobblestones
Where is she at ? Let's take a guess
Jaywalking in the streets of Rome

She's like a hotline
you can call whether rain or shine
when it looks like nothing is bright
A few words with her and, it'll be allright

She is your chatter box
Writes you real letters
Oh roman goldilocks
She's some upsetter

There she goes - tropical cyclone
Barefoot on the cobblestones
Looking for Saint Jerome
Jaywalking through the streets of Rome

Picking up white owl feathers
She buries to keep safe
Drinking oil and loving cats
Gives her their pur rand their scratch

Trees Leaves and Seashells
Will make her day

In miscellaneous ways

Roaming along the gaps in the city

Tastes like the time when I lost you
I don't know next time when I see you
Will we always fit the same?
I know there's something to be found here
Counting days away from you
But I'll take, take all of this in now

Missing you is all that I'm breathing

Son las hechas con amor

Que el acero de una voz

Organ fusion tissue severity

Attaching umbilical drains healthy tissue
Viable nutrients barely sustains frailty
Interlacing vessels, surrounding complexity

Evolving outside the placental network
Rejection of foreign vagrant
Clinging internally, undeliverable
Isolated fetus surviving past the term
Waning food supply, slowly dehydrates
Arteries swell and bulge, status soon unfolds
Shriveled skin tinged gray
Violent spasms, outward decay

Crumble, flake, dried away
Encased fetus exists as stone

Severing connection abdominal nuisance
Shed the life, reabsorption
Breakdown harbored mass to fuel the other systems
Vanquished, dissipate, nothing but a memory
A mere trimester of discomfort

Calcified, ectopic intertwined

113,Against Me!,Piss And Vinegar (Album Version),TRKTFRF128F4298D1A,2007,"I've heard the hype about your band, I've seen your video playing on the TV
Publicity photos in magazines, no none of it makes me feel anything
I would be lying to you if I did not say something that would make me feel like a politician
A middle of the road opinion no one finds offensive or challenging

I'm not interested, this stage is not a pedestal
I don't think you're bad people, I just think that your aesthetic is horrible
Please treat me with the same respect and candor, I would appreciate the honesty
A little less professional, a little more upfront and confrontational

Just say what you're thinking
Say what you're really thinking"

someone stop this worry song
Another tomorrow is staring me down
I look thru the window and
still wear this frown
Give me a reason to stop looking back 
and keep me away from this attack
‘Cause I’ve been there, yes I’ve been there…

Tormented, overwhelming, compulsive state of being all the time
But tomorrow, I’ll be fine

I don’t wanna’ think about it, don’t wanna’ make you 
think that everything is alright
And when I think about it, no it’s not fair, 
and it’s dragging me down

A lifetime of learning is what we believe 
keeps our lives from becoming 
something that’s sacred and something that ties 
everybody else inside 
You’ve got a secret, I’ll tell you mine
Catch me tomorrow, I swear I’ll be fine
Give me a reason to stop looking back; 
all my intentions are now black
‘Cause I’ve done that, yes I’ve done that…

a set direction of what you tell everyone
So keep your head straight,

Like spittle from a cloud, amassed resentment pelting ounce and pound 
You entertaining any doubts?

'Cause you had to know that I was fond of you, fond of y-o-u
Though I knew you masked your disdain
I can see that change was just too hard for us, hard for us
You always had to hold the reins, but where I'm headed you just don't know the way

So affections fade away
And do adults just learn to play the most ridiculous, repulsive games?
All our favorite ruddy sons
And their double-barreled guns, you'd better hurry, rabbit, run, run, run 'cause mincing you is fun

And there's a lot of hungry hatters in this world, set on taking it over
But brittle thorny stems
They break before they bend and neither one of us is one of them
And the tears will never mend

'Cause you had it in for me so long ago, boy, I still don't know
I don't know why and I don't care, well, hardly anymore
If you'd only seen yourself hating me, hating me when I'd been so much more than fair
But then you'd have to lay those feelings bare, the one thing I know has still got you scared
Yeah, all that cold ire and never once aired on a dare

You had to know that I was fond of you, fond of y-o-u
So I took your licks at the time
And a change like that is just so hard to do, hard to do
Don't let it whip-crack your life

Obligada a enloquecer

Ni adelante, ni hacia atras aunque vuelva a tropezar
Si querer es poder, y yo quiero aprender a vivir

Defenderme o tratar de vencer,
Ser verdugo o ser rehen
Acabar sin sentirme capaz de imponer mi autoridad
Desarmando malos pensamientos

Puede que me quede sin aliento en la encrucijada
De envenenarme o no beber
