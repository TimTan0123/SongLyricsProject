0,Crash Test Dummies,Androgynous,TRAJOTJ128F428CEF5,1991,"Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane you know she's sportin' a chain
Same hair, a revolution
Same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?
And they love each other so, androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous

We'll don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
He might be a father but he sure aint a dad
And she don't need the advice that is sent to her
She's happy the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
And they love each other so, androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous

Mirror image, see no damage, see no evil at all
Cupie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at
The way you're laughed at now

Something meets boy and something meets girl
They both look the same they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair revolution
Unisex evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?

And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants,
Tomorrow Jane is wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries

And they love each other so, androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous."
1,Rick Astley,Never Knew Love,TRMMZKU128F4296801,1991,"Your love is warm as a ray of sun
Touching me when the morning comes
So lucky am I to have you by my side
Forever

Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me
Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me

Thought I had it all in the palm of my hand
Darkness had fallen on me and I didn't quite understand
Then came you you brightened up my days yeah
Forever

Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me
Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me

Oh I know
Never knew love never knew love

Could feel this way
Could do this to me
Could feel this way
Could do this to me
I never knew your love
Could do this to me
Could feel this way

Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me
Never knew love could feel this way
Never knew love could do this to me"
2,Warrior Soul,Children of the Winter,TREUJXX12903CD18E9,1991,"This fight's for you and me
In the land of the free
The rock minority
Against hypocrisy

They crucify our words
But they don't understand
We want a better world
And a share of our land

They point at us
But we're their children
We fight because
They taught us to be free

The land where our fathers died
The land of the pilgrims' pride
Forced us to decide
If we stand or if we hide

Believe in me
We'll fight forever
Until we're free
We'll fight together

Oh yeah, come down
Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime

The Fathers fought a revolution
A fight for what we believe in
Our rights sewn, there's no confusion
I don't need to be forgiven, to be forgiven

The land where our fathers died
The land of the pilgrims' pride
My hatred I can't hide
I'll kill before they take my rights

Come walk with me
We'll go to Heaven
The world will be
Our dreams together

Come take my hand
Rejoice forever
The promised land
If we remember

Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime
Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime

Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime
Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime
Children of the winter
Walk into the springtime"

4,Maldita Vecindad Y Los Hijos Del Quinto Patio,Mare,TRIWWCH128F92FD279,1991,"Hace cuatro meses que salí de Yucatan,
Y me vine en camión a la ciudad.
Vine a visitar a unos parientes
Que viven por acá por Insurgentes.

Mucha ninias lindas.
Mucha tonta violencia.
Mucho ruido y mucha gente.
Yo mejor me regreso a Yucatán.

Mare
Mare niña.

Una mañana me invitaron a pasear.
Fuí a Chapultepec, la Latino y Coyoacan.
Mis parientes resultaron muy decentes
Y esa noche decidí irme a reventar.

Mucha luz en la calle.
Todo es despapaye.
La verdad yo prefiero los hipiles,
Y mejor me regreso a Yucatán.

Mare
Mare niña."
5,Celebrate The Nun,Waiting,TRQPNBC128F92EFBF3,1991,"I never wanted to believe the things they said
I never wanted to know
I've been waiting for so long, it's a language
Why do you let me go?

And every time when I remember the past
I really don't know what to do
'Cause every time I know I'll never forget
I just can't stop thinking of you

All that I've been waiting for
You don't know why I want to go
All that I've been waiting for
You don't know why I have to go
All that I’ve been waiting for - is you

I should have know that you don't understand
Things I never wanted to do
I should have know it's better telling the truth
That's why I feel like a fool

I start walking all around in the streets
But I don’t have no idea
I’m watching all the people at night
But all I want is you were here

All that I've been waiting for
You don't know why I want to go
All that I've been waiting for
You don't know why I have to go
All that I’ve been waiting for - is you

And every time when I remember the past
I really don't know what to do
'Cause every time I know I'll never forget
I just can't stop thinking of you

All that I've been waiting for
You don't know why I want to go

You don't know why I have to go
All that I’ve been waiting for - is you"
6,X-Ray Spex,The Day The World Turned Day-Glo,TRSTWDY128F92EC06D,1991,"I clambered over mounds and mounds of polystyrene foam
Then fell into a swimming pool filled with fairy snow

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

I wrenched the nylon curtains back as far as they would go
Then peered through perspex window panes at the acrylic road

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

I drove my polypropylene car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a wimpy bar to have a rubber bun

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh



The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

The X-rays were penetrating through the latex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves fell from the rayon trees

The day the world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh"
7,Gary Numan,Heart,TRQVTOS128E0782C6C,1991,"Does she make you laugh?
Does she make you cry?
Does she call your name?
Let me tell you why.

Have you ever tried to look into her eyes?
Have you ever tried to look into her heart?

There is no-one home.
Time will heal you
Time heals everything
Just an empty room.
Time will help you
Time helps you forget
There's no tears for you.
Time will heal you
Time heals everyone
There's no heart at all.
Time will help you
Time helps you forget me.

She will change your world.
She will change your mind.
She will change your rules.
She will make you blind.

You will never try to look into her eyes.
You will never try to look into her heart.

See there's no-one home.
Time will heal you
Time heals everything
See an empty room.
Time will help you
Time helps you forget
See no tears for you.
Time will heal you
Time heals everyone
See no heart at all.
Time will help you
Time helps you forget me.

I'll leave you
You'll try to forget.
I'll haunt you.
Like someone haunts me.
I'll leave you.
You'll try to forgive.
I'll haunt you.
Like someone haunts me.

Does she laugh at you
Like she laughed at me?
Does she break your heart
Like she broke mine?"
8,Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,TRPNEMM128E0792477,1991,"(The Perils of Rock N' Roll decadence)
I know this chick she lives down on Melrose
She ain't satisfied without some pain
Friday night is goin' up inside her...again
Well crack the whip
'Cause that bitch is just insane
I'm serious

She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up
An you can ride her
She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no,oh no,oh no
Once there was this rock n' roll band rollin' on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling- Uh-huh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
But check it out

She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up
An you can ride her
She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
Ohh I can't tell you she's the
right one
Oh no,oh no,oh no
Once you made that money it costs more now
It might cost a lot more than you'd think
I just found a million dollars
That someone forgot
It's days like this that push me o'er the brinks
Cool and stressing

She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
She's pretty tied up
An you can ride her
She's pretty tied up
Hangin' upside down
And I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh she's the right one...(etc.)

(But I can tell you a thing or two
'Bout somethin' else
If you really wanna know-Know what
I'm sayin')"
9,Blues Traveler,Sweet Pain,TRLKVND128F42712D1,1991,"If Cyrano de Bergerac 
Fell prey to the blades of fifty men 
With a heart and a sword he'd drive them back 
Perchance to see Roxanne's eyes light up the sky again 
And when beauty kind and full of grace 
Again denied the beast her hand 
The beast he turned and hid his face 
And tried with all his might and magic to understand 

And once upon a time 
You know, I used to wonder why 
You know, no one should need to cry 
In pain of a heart forbade to fly 
But you learn to say goodbye 
As you whisper beneath a sigh 

Sweet pain 
Can't you plainly see? 
Sweet pain 
You know it matters to me 
Sweet pain 
Won't you make me feel at home? 
Sweet pain 
Don't you dare leave me alone 

Sometimes a life that seems hard to take 
Is soothed for a while by an old friend 
Leaving a bad need in its wake 
Sad how some friendships never ever seem to end 
Never end
Well all of my heroes up and died 
Songs and a dream are left for me 
What did them in? Not suicide 
Just a lengthy friendship and a dream of how it could be 
And isn't it a crime? 

Was it more than they could bear? 
You know they did not even care 
At all and they might have something there 
But I'm here and I don't see where 
All I hear is their silent prayer 

Sweet pain 
Is it so terribly wrong? 
Sweet pain 
To want to come along 
Sweet pain 
Won't you make me smile? 
Sweet pain 
If only for a while 

Can you feel what I can feel? 
So we can establish that the pain is real 
Don't be afraid and I'll do the same for you 
And we'll just hang on and we'll make it, make it through 
There's got to be a reason it works out this way 
And there's something deep inside me 
That makes me have to play 
For you 
For you 

In no position to give advice 
My heart, it spoke and I wrote it down 
And you know every wisdom has its price 
My head up in the stars 
And my feet planted firmly on the ground 
When will I embrace this life I see? 
I've been wondering for so long 
Thinking back the truth may be 
I've been unaware but I've been living it all along 

And it didn't cost a dime 
And it did not come for free 
It just would not let me be 
But it never conquered me 
Just a doorway and a key 
And I think that we both agree 

Sweet pain 
Is sometimes what you need 
Sweet pain 
It allows the blood to bleed 
Sweet pain 
From the moment of your birth 
Sweet pain 
You know it keeps you here on Earth"
10,Paula Abdul,Spellbound,TRYXYBM128F145852D,1991,"Why does love hurt so 
How do you just know 
How to get to me baby 
Words aren't only words 
When they're from you they're 
Heard 
When you say 
You really love me 
Maybe it's a trick 
Something doesn't click 
Maybe it's a spell 
That you've got me under 
Something's going down 
Turn my world around 
I woke up and I found 
I was spellbound. 

Chorus: 
Spellbound 
So 
Spellbound 
So wicked 
Spellbound 
And your prison 
Feels good so 
Spellbound 
Your kisses 
Spellbound 
Against my wishes 
Spellbound 
I wouldn't help it if I could 

Metaphysical past the visual 
You touch the heart of me 
Night turns in to day 
Shadows fade away 
When you say you 
Really love me 
Maybe it's a trick 
Something doesn't click 
Maybe it's a spell 
That you've got me under 
Something's going down 
Turn my world around 
I woke up and I found 
I was spellbound 

Chorus 

Maybe it's a trick 
Something doesn't click 
Maybe it's a spell 
That you've got me under 
Something's going down

11,Bad English,Life At The Top,TRFOTSO128F42626B7,1991,"He looks like deniro
She's his brigitte bardot
And that's enough to hang around
With those who think they know
But if you've got the image
And symbols of success
You must be doing something right
To keep up with the jones's
They made it from the castin' couch
The sex was rock an' roll
They're everybody's business
Inquiring minds must know
Every slummy little detail
Every superficial move
And you can buy it retail

12,Too Much Joy,Good Kill (Album Version),TRPPQIB128F4234621,1991,"Some people think that they’re in commercials
Some people treat you like you don’t exist
Sometimes I’d like to go to a McDonald’s
Shoot some people as they walk in my sights
All the same I’d never join the army
All the same I’m still ashamed at night

C’mon baby let’s fight the good fight
Against all good fights

Some people think Rod McKuen is a poet
Some people think there’s evil folks and good
Some people vote to electrocute the bad ones
They stand outside the prison and cheer when the lights go dim
I know everybody is my brother
Even my brother though I don’t care much for him"
13,Deacon Blue,The Day That Jackie Jumped The Jail,TRQNBHV128F4259941,1991,"The day that Jackie jumped the jail
The day that Jackie jumped the jail
There was a big explosion just as he got off the motorway
And thirty thousand fireworks took the piss out of Princes Street
Gardens
So he drove up to the Budgie for a livener
See the smell of cabbages first thing in the morning
The sun will be up again
And you you will be loved again
After the sausages and cream of the barley
There was aframe or two to be had at the ""Imperial"" on Mitchell Street
Five years ago he'd buried her memory with a snooker cue on a daft wee
student's head
Still he remembered everything
The sun will be up again
And you you will be loved again
And the wind
And the rain
And the wind
And the rain
Falls around
I don't know
I don't know
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
As he walked down Hope Street he thought about the last time they'd been
together
He'd been wearing a green parka and he'd bought her yellow stilettos
That squeezed her toes
He'd told her the whole story as she took him into the wee penn behind
Sloan's
And let him feel her all over
For the last time
Ten minutes later the meat wagon picked him up
The sun will be up again
And you
You
You
You will be loved
You will be loved
You will be loved again
And the wind
And the rain
And the wind
And the rain
Falls around
All over this town
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Falls around
All over this town

Falls around
All over
All over

14,Kingmaker,Every Teenage Suicide,TRNSUFK128F426C403,1991,"Three minutes time
My well will run dry
No need to cry or feel sorrow

The moon is a jewel
But it shines like a fool
I can't really face tomorrow

Suicide

Stood on a chair
Soon I'll hang in the air
Swinging from the lamp by a noose

Blackest of thoughts
God knows I have fought
But alive I don't feel any use

Suicide

Finally cracked
I'm down on the tracks
My head is lined up with the wheels

Tried to be loved
Find a force from above
Below is always how I feel

Suicide"

there's a hole in the sky
illuminating dreamquest
the prophet's eye
by virtue of madness
a sign of faith
lurking at the threshold
you're lost between the gates

Death's a solution to life's dead illusions

Stranger aeons - stained by re-creation
Stranger aeons - of hallucination

Stranger things that eternal lie
awaiting beyond the time to die
in the city of gods in the temple of lies

You were wrong from the start

Stranger aeons - of hallucination
Take strange drugs - swallow your pride

This is not a black and white world
You can't afford to believe in your side

This is not a black and white world

And I believe that maybe today
We will all get to appreciate

Salt frozen on your cheek
I saw a girl and boy arriving
And a steamer put out to sea

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
You must keep running the distance

Sun sleeps on misty morning
Light years from channel three
I feel halfway to zero
Call me a hero I might just agree

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin
You must keep running the distance

And the roses you grow
Have a powerful scent
They'll be breaking your heart
By the morning

I feel halway to zero
Call me a hero I might just agree

Tall tree
Stand in the distance
Remember
When you were green
Don't wipe
The salt from your skin

20,Harry Connick_ Jr.,The Last Payday,TRUMEIK128F426232A,1991,"Danny was an old-time Bourbon Street barker
Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker
And always cued-up a ball
Thinking he was one rack away
But even when you run the table
The check still seems small
When it's your last payday

The shallow pocket changer
Who always took advantage of strangers
Tried to make a five-grand grab
With a split second getaway
But he forgot that a bag of money
Ain't worth much on a slab
When it's your last payday

That line about luck just can't be bought
You're always lucky 'til you get caught
Trouble will find you, no need to look
And luck won't help when they close the book

I know a lot of young fellas in here
Especially those on the highest tier
Still want to believe
That Santa comes in a sleigh

Here I Am
Playing with those memories again
And Just when I thought time has set me free
Those thoughts of you keep haunting me
Holding You, A feeling I never once knew
Though each and every part of me had tried
Only you can fill that space inside
But I guess am pretending
My heart is not mending

Chorus
Just when I thought I was over you, yeah
Just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh Baby, those memories just come crashing through
And I just can't, go on without, you

On my own, I've tried to make the best of things alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you
I've got everything about you

Ohh Yea-yea, Here I Am

She cou'n't say nothing but, ""It'll never happen again.""

I think, sweet mama, I'll have to let you go

So pack up all your clothes, you can't sleep here no more

It's bad to have a crooked woman, she'll keep you livin' in sin

24,Julian Lennon,Imaginary Lines,TRGYILR12903CFE0C9,1991,"Heaven help the soul that's severed
From the place where it belongs
caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong 
Headlights along the border
Keep the peace, their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies
It's their kind of strength
It's their only defense
An imaginary line

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire

And now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies
(Why can't we see)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines

In times like these concerning
Who decides which bridge is burning
Don't fall for-map reading
Just make sure that you're still breathing

After the lines were drawn, the children would
dream of the pearls and how beautiful they were.
Year after year they would dive to the bottom of
the lagoon hoping that the oysters would come
back. They risked everything-their homes, families
and meager possessions-to search for the pearls.
To make sure they were heavy enough to reach the
bottom, the children tied stones to their backs.
Many of them died, streams of blood and broken
bodies rose to the surface of the lagoon...and
the lagoon cried.

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies
(Why can't we see)
It's their kind of strength
Their only defense
An imaginary line

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies
(Why can't we see)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines"

My diametrical state has assured me eternal life.

Serum no longer fluid.
Respritoral terminus.
Artificial resurrection.
Dosage inefficiency.

Potency too weak to perfect.
Cartilage reaching gelency.
Misconception of technology.

Unknown duration to live.
Decadence, your state of being.
Putrification progresses.
Subside.

Bones that collapse in time will heal.
Brain patterns submerged in unconsciousness.
Only to be awakened by the peroneal senses.
To see once again, to be reborn.

Needles perforate my neck.
Cyanide smothers my existence.
My torso lies raped of essence.
Impotent state.
I cease to exist.
As my former self.
Synthetically revived"

Nobody plays with me, Nobody loves me.
I've got a friend that you can't see,
My friend's name is Nobody.
Nobody listens, Nobody cares.

One day while playing baseball outside
He broke the window then ran off to hide.
My mom came out and she asked me,
""Who did this?""
I said, ""Nobody.""
Nobody believed me, mom said I lied.

[Chorus] 

We talk under the covers late at night,
After I have gone to bed,
Turned out the light.
My dad came in and he asked me,
""Who ya talkin' to?""
I said, ""Nobody.""
Nobody listens, dad says be quiet.

Nobody sure gets me in trouble.
For Nobody I take a lot of blame.
But if Nobody's gonna be my friend,
I sure wish he'd get another name.

Nobody listens, Nobody cares.
Nobody listens, Nobody cares."

Lying in the Northern wind
As the Sky turns Black
Clouds of Melancholy
Rape the Beams
Of a Devoid Dying Sun
And the Distant Fog approaches

Coven of forgotten Delight
Hear the Pride of a Northern Storm
Triumphant sight on a Northern Sky

Where the days are Dark
And Night the Same
Moonlight Drank the Blood
Of a thousand Pagan men

It took ten times a hundred Years
Before the King on the Northern Throne
Was brought Tales of the crucified one

Coven of renewed Delight;
A Thousand Years have passed since then -
Years of Lost Pride and Lust

Souls of Blasphemy,
Hear a Haunting Chant -

We are a Blaze in the Northern Sky
The next thousand Years Are OURS"
33,Aaron Tippin,You've Got To Stand For Something,TRABSQC128F428AD3D,1991,"Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standin' up
For what he thought was right

He'd say, ""You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything""

Now we might've been better off or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backin' down
But we always had plenty just living his advice
""Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight""

He'd say, ""You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right, and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything""

And I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed

You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right, and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

And I wonder why
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Yeah, I wonder why

I'm no angel
With my selfish pride
But I love you more everyday
Love is an anger
That builds up inside
As the tears of frustation
Roll down my face

Hey sweetheart cool off, you're not so distraught
You lost what you had but that's what I've got
I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes
No wait a while 'til this feelings goes
The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness
We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess

The sensation of life was aroused in ourself
From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves
Then burned down the house, then met in a bar
With a motel attached and kissed all the scar

It seems a miracle that I'm still sitting here
Staring at these parallel lines
Stretching out and going somewhere
I got a jar of shells by my bedside
I got a silver train running outside
I got a heart running wild, running wild
Love is such a temporary thing
It comes and goes a thousands times a day
No hard feelings in the songs I sing
Just another town to blow my heart away
I got a yellow rose from my garden
And a faded photo of my father
He's still keeping one eye on the weather
I got a heart running wild, running wild
Make believe you're somewhere else
It's a game I've learned to play a lot lately
Driving round here by myself
With the dog palms and the sunsets and the sea
I got a jar of shells by my bedside
I got a silver train running outside
I got a bird that sings in the morning
Shadows on the floor slowly shifting
I got a box of paints but the lid's gone
I got a string of pearls from my last song

Cause baby, you're the last one
That I should wanna see
But I still turn each corner
Hoping you'll run into me

Out of sight and on my mind
Your memory's always with me
Like a shadow in the night
That I can't leave behind

Got a feeling that these feelings
Ain't never gonna die
And you're gonna stay forever
Out of sight and on my mind"

I will assure all of the
Husbands who are guilty and the wives who feel useless
I will nurse all of the black and blue babies
With their unhappy parents who had unhappy parents
And I will assure all of the
Boys who feel awkward and the girls who feel clumsy
I will walk alongside the old man
Who feels so alone as everyone rushes by him, now baby

You flew away.

50,Christy Moore,Burning Times,TRAIPIA128F4273A3D,1991,"In the cold of the evening, they used to gather.
Neath the stars in the meadow, circled near the old oak tree.

At the times appointed.. by the seasons..
of the earth, and the phases of the moon.

In the center, often stood a woman,
equal with the others, respected for her worth.

One of the many.. we call the witches,
the healers, the teachers, of the wisdom of the earth.

And the people grew in the knowledge she gave them,
herbs to heal their bodies, smells to make their spirits whole.

Hear them chanting healing incantations,
calling for the wise ones, celebrating in dance and song...

(...Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna... repeat x2)

There were those that came to power, through domination.
They were bonded in their worship of a dead man on a cross.

They sought control of the common people,
by demanding allegiance to the church of Rome.

And the Pope, he commenced the inquisition,
As a war against the women, whose powers they feared.

In this holocaust, in this age of evil,
Nine million European women, they died.

And the tale is told, of those who by the hundreds,
holding hands together, chose their deaths in the sea.

While chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess,
a refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free.

(...Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali... Inanna... repeat x2)

Now the earth is a witch, and we still burn her.
Stripping her down with mining, and the poison of our wars.

Still to us, the earth is a healer, a teacher, and a mother.
A weaver of a web of light, that keeps us all alive.

She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.
She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive.

(Repeat Goddess chant x4)"

dove non c'è ipocrisia
e il lavoro è allegria,
mille pianeti più in là
dove guerra non ci sta,
dove tempo ci sarà
tutta un'eternità
per vivere come vorrai
con gli amici che avrai;

triste tu,
partirai e non tornerai più.

prima o poi ci dimenticherai;
sei caduta tra noi, ma no,

in quanti mondi viaggerai,
chissà cosa vedrai:
l'inferno che è già dentro noi,
il nulla, un Dio, cos'altro mai
noi siamo stupidi, lo sai,
condannati a non capire mai;

dei nostri amori, i nostri guai

voli e vai dove vuoi;

So many times I've been scared about tomorrow

Some wounds never heal
They still say someday the South will rise
Man, I want to see that deal

I don't want to grow old gracefully
I don't want to go 'til it's too late
I'll be some old man in the road somewhere
Kneeling down in the dust by the side of the Interstate

I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days

We were hopelessly outnumbered
It was a lost cause all along
But when we heard the bugles call
We swore we'd stand or fall together right or wrong

We ain't seen no reconstruction here
Just the scorched earth all around
And the high school band played ""Dixieland""
While they tore our tattered flags and banners down

I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days

Some prayers never reach the sky
Some wars never end
Some dreams refuse to die
Next time I would rather break than bend

I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days
I am a renegade
I've been a rebel all my days

He'd light 'em up just for fun

Richmond engine number three
I'll be a wealthy man when I get a dime
For all the things that man taught to me

It stuck in his craw
That they made him retire at the age of sixty five

Fill their pockets up with calling cards
And paint their faces red white and blue
Then they go out seeking different coloured faces
And anyone else that they can scare
And they salute the foes their fathers fought
By raising their right hands in the air.
Oh look how my country's patriots are hunting down below
What do they know of England who only England know?

From the stands of the Empire Stadium
Come the heralds of the New Dark Age
With the simplicities of bigotry
And to whom all the world's a stage
These little John Bullshits know that the press
Will glorify their feats
So that the general public fear them
And the authorities say give 'em all seats
And the wasted seed of the bulldog breed
Is shouting ""Here we go!""
What do they know of England who only England know?

Our neighbours shake their heads
And take their valuables inside
While my countrymen piss in their fountains
To express our national pride
And to prove to the world that England
Is just as rotten as she looks
They repeat the lies that caught their eyes
At school in history books
But the wars they think they're fighting
Were all over long ago
What do they know of England who only England know?

And the society that spawned them
Just cries out ""Who's to blame?""
And then wraps itself in the Union Jack
And just carries on the same
Oh look out, my country's patriots are hunting down below
What do they know of England who only England know?"

Und es gibt'n haufen Dinge, die ich tun muss
Ich muss morgens aufstehn, den Wecker erstmal ausdrehn
In's Badezimmer laufen und dann in den Spiegel sehn
Muss dann erstmal duschen, den Rasierer nehmen
Denn ich kann es auf den Tod nicht ab, wenn Schnurrbartstoppeln stehen
Dann muss ich Frühstück machen, viele gute Sachen
Schalt das Radio ein und dann muss ich furchtbar lachen
Denn diese Scheiß Popmusik kann man besser machen
Spül den Kaffee runter durch die Kehle durch den Rachen
Rein in die Klamotten, von Reebok mir gestellt
Meine Autoschlüssel und die Taschen voller geld
Willste mich mal sprechen, sage ich: tut mir leid
Denn ich haben jetzt beim besten willen keine Zeit

Tausend Mark gehen noch, mehr nicht
Kann ich locker machen, wirklich, ehrlich
Was? so wenig? leg noch dreihundert drauf
Und er sagt ja und er macht die Kasse auf
Dann muss ich mich beeilen und muss noch Platten kaufen
Dann muss ich noch zur Post und zum Studio laufen
Dann muss ich wieder weiter, muss im Stau stehen
Und muss dann mit dem Bärchen nochn kleines Ding drehen
Dann muss ich das probieren, muss auch noch promovieren
Aber anschließend muss ich noch telefonieren
Irgendnochwas essen darf ich nicht vergessen
Aber irgendwie ist die Zeit zu knapp bemessen
Muss den ganzen Tag mit dem Auto rumrauschen
Muss mich mit jenem treffen und Adressen tauschen
Willste mich mal sprechen, sage ich: tut mir leid
Denn ich habe jetzt beim besten willen keine Zeit

Geld verdienen und wieder ausgeben
Musste machen, mann, damit musste leben
Auf der Bank immer hin und her buchen
Und dann muss ich noch nach den Auszügen suchen
Muss noch Steuern zahlen, dann muss ich zu den Wahlen
Wie das dann ausgeht kann ich mir jetzt schon ausmalen
Doch ist mir egal, was die da oben treiben
Denn ich muss noch zurück und nochn Text schreiben
Doch halt, keine Zeit, muss das Date rauskicken
Und muss stattdessen paar Demos verschicken
Dann muss ich weiter fahren, muss dann noch zur Tanke
Dreißig Liter, Büchse Coke, hier die Mücken, danke
Immer hin und her, das fällt mir gar nicht schwer
Doch platz im Terminkalender habe ich nicht mehr

He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on.

I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;
""As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal"";
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel,
Since God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;
Our God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free;
[originally …let us die to make men free]
While God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on.

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave,
He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave;
So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave,
Our God is marching on.
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Enthroned through this age of confusion an urge,
the weakness and flooy since aeons emerged,
Created life in fetters from cradle to grave
A future in darkness with mankind enslaved

Trail of life decayed - wasteland whall prevail
Hatred lies in store - chaos evermore

So runs the spiel from where lives are found and lost:
""Learn from past failures - prevent to pay the cost""

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm

When our time spells an end to our ruling of this earth,
will a wasteland remain?
Will all life cease to be by the wicked ways of man
- his enfeebled domain?

Nature left in flames - Suffering, now to maim
Cataclysm at hand - unveiled unto man

So runs the spiel from where lives are lost and found:
""Progression in spirit eliminates all bounds""

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm

Hallow minds start to burn with the flaming shades of fall
let disorder arise!
An avenge to be brought to the ones who graveled earth
hides now cloaked in disguise

Blind deception, mass confusion - interbreeding dark illusions
Tumbelling, falling, brings conclusions -
constant fatal life-corrosion

Autumn - beckons forth the
winter - rising gloom in hand
Raging with bleak coldness 'til
vernal light commands

Final chapter closed - world devoid of use
Failure brings despair - death reveals its lair

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm"

Con gli altri chiusi in sé che si aprono al sole come fiori quando

Si risvegliano, si rivestono
Quando escono, partono, arrivano
Ci somigliano angeli avvoltoi
Come specchi gli occhi nei volti
Perché gli altri siamo noi

I muri vanno giù al soffio di un'idea
Allah come Gesù in chiesa o dentro una moschea
E gli altri siamo noi ma qui sulla stessa via
Vigliaccamente eroi lasciamo indietro i pezzi di altri nomi

Che ci aspettano e si chiedono
Perché nascono e subito muoiono
Forse rondini, foglie d'Africa
Ci sorridono di malinconia
E tutti vittime e carnefici tanto prima o poi
Gli altri siamo noi

Quando cantano, quando piangono
(gli altri siamo noi, siamo noi, siamo noi)
In questo mondo gli altri siamo noi
Quando nascono, quando muoiono
(gli altri siamo noi, siamo noi, siamo noi)
Gli altri siamo noi

Noi che stiamo in comodi deserti
Di appartamenti e di tranquillità
Lontani dagli altri, ma tanto prima o poi
Gli altri siamo noi

In questo mondo piccolo oramai
Gli altri siamo noi

Sì gli altri siamo noi fra gli indios e gli indù
Ragazzi in farmacia che ormai non ce la fanno più
Famiglie di operai licenziati dai robot
E zingari dell'est in riserve di periferie

How long will you run away?
How long? How long?

Waited for you, but you never came around,
Gate is open, the light still burns,
When will you return home?

How long? How long?
How long will you run away?
How long? How long?
How long will you run away?

Little lamb, gone astray,
shepherd searches for you all day,
He'll run to you when he sees your face;
crown and a warm embrace,
So, tell me...

I won't grow up
I don't wanna go to school
Just to learn to be a puppet
And recite a silly rule

If growing up means it would be
Beneath my dignity to climb a tree
I won't grow up, won't grow up, won't grow up
Not me.

I won't grow up
I don't wanna wear a tie
Or a serious expression
In the middle of July

And if it means that I must prepare
To shoulder burdens with a worried air
I'll never grow up, won't grow up, never grow up
So there

Never gonna be a man
I won't!
Like to see somebody try
And make me!
Anyone who wants to try
And make me turn into a man
Catch me if you can

I won't grow up
I don't wanna wear a tie
Or a serious expression
In the middle of July

Growing up's awfuller than
All the awful things that never been
I won't grow up, won't grow up, won't grow up
Again

Growing up's awfuller than
All the awful things that never been
I won't grow up, never grow up, never grow up
Again
Not me
Not I"

And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me, what will I do?

I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one

He's in love with her, but she can't see him. 
It makes him sometimes feel like he don't exist 
But the memories linger of the times they kissed.

  He still loves her and it's tearing him apart
 And he don't know whether to hide his heart.  
It's like a book he read that Jane Austen wrote 
When she's near his heart starts bumping inside his throat

 Well he's a wounded man and a suffering fool 
But love is mercurial and life is cruel.
  He loves her and it's tearing him apart
 And he don't know whether to hide his heart.
 He don't know whether to hide his heart.

  And when he drives past the Tower of London
 Or walks down the Champs Elysees
 Or has lunch with Jackie Onassis
 His mind is a million miles away

 He feels so tres deshabille
  He loves her he loves her
 And it's tearing him apart.
 He don't know whether to hide his heart.
 He don't know whether to hide his heart.

  So now she's found somebody that she loves more
 And he's an outtake on the cutting room floor.
 She's an actress who has quit the stage
 He's a mystery novel with a torn out page

  She is leaving and it's tearing him apart
 He don't know whether to hide his heart.

Of man to attain God

Inscrutable mystery to me
My principle anguish and source
Of all my joys and sorrows

Religion's domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate
Anno Domini ends - misery

From my youth onward
Has been the incessant
Merciless battle between
The spirit and the flesh
And my soul is the arena
Where these two armies
Have clashed and met

Holy wars unleashing bloody raids
The sacred earth without a face
Consumed by murderous sinners
Psychotic leader
Insane - insane - insane - insane!

Living in a dying age
Persecute the human race
Triumph of death in the wasteland
Blood signs your epitaph

Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate

Honoured by the Carnal Herds

And Teeth that was my Pride

Summon my Warriors - To the Land of Desire
To the Domain of Hate - Where Cold Winds Blew
For Lust for Hell - We Rode with the North Wind

Only I could accomplish a fucken Self-deceit
There are only Two Paths - the Mind or the Sword
And the Mind was Open like the Sights in a Dream

One on one
All thru the night
Ooh I take my time
And work it slow
You've been whipped
Before you know
Cause these arms
There's ectasy
Once we've touched
You're history
Ooh imagine baby
You'll lose control
When we make love
Away we go

[Chorus:]
The whole world is ours tonight
We can do what we want to
Just tell me your delight
Girl I'll steal your heart
Take your breath away
Take you on a lovers holiday
We can't stop now
While we're in flight
We can't turn back
It feels too right, ooh
Our destinations, not far away
In just one minute...a holiday now

As we're coming down baby
Hold me close cause I'm not through and
There won't be no ground baby
I'm a work it, I'm a whack it, til you like it
Up up up and away and away we go

Pour notre bonheur pour notre lumière
Avec ton sourire avec tes yeux clairs
Ton esprit ouvert ton air généreux

Tu aurais pu vivre encore un peu
Mon fidèle ami mon copain mon frère
Au lieu de partir tout seul en croisière
Et de nous laisser comme chiens galeux

Tu aurais pu vivre encore un peu

T'aurais pu rêver encore un peu
Te laisser bercer près de la rivière
Par le chant de l'eau courant sur les pierres
Quand des quatre fers l'été faisait feu

T'aurais pu rêver encore un peu
Sous mon châtaignier à l'ombre légère
Laisser doucement le temps se défaire
Et la nuit tomber sur la vallée bleue

T'aurais pu rêver encore un peu

Tu aurais pu jouer encore un peu
Au lieu de lâcher tes boules peuchère
Aujourd'hui sans toi comment va-t-on faire
Dans notre triplette on n'est plus que deux

Tu aurais pu jouer encore un peu
Ne pas t'en aller sans qu'on ait pu faire
A ces rigolos mordre la poussière
Avec un enjeu du tonnerre de Dieu

Tu aurais pu jouer encore un peu

On aurait pu rire encore un peu
Avec les amis des soirées entières
Sur notre terrasse aux roses trémières
Parfumée d'amour d'histoires et de jeux

On aurait pu rire encore un peu
Et dans la beauté des choses éphémères
Caresser nos femmes et lever nos verres
Sans s'apercevoir qu'on était heureux

On aurait pu rire encore un peu

Tu aurais pu vivre encore un peu
Ne pas m'imposer d'écrire ces vers
Toi qui savais bien mon ami si cher
A quel point souvent je suis paresseux

Tu aurais pu vivre encore un peu"

Cause the airplane's never ready and it gives you time to ask you'll be back when
Well we both know that I don't know we only know I will come home
But I'll always have to fly away again
I know it doesn't come out right for you it's not the kind of life
For you have to save love and keep on waitin' for a moving man
I know you hope the time will come I won't say goodbye and run
But I'm yours before I fly away again

Go ahead and try to smile it makes it better for a while
I know you feel the way I do your misty eyes tell me you'll wait till then
Our time together's not enough it's the same thing for our love
But I'm yours before I fly away again
We hear the engine's whining now when all the time it's wrong somehow
Your misty eyes have turned to sad and I'll tell you I love you once again
I've got your picture in my mind I will until the end of time
I'm yours before I fly away again

Well here we are in the same old gate there's always time we have to wait
Cause the airplane's never ready and it gives you time to ask you'll be back when"

It's the end of a wonderful time
In my thoughts I have seen
There was somebody else on your mind

And I feel where ever I go
It's the time that I want to know
If you leave and I'm left on my own
I don't know what can I do

Is it the way you came into my life
Is it the way you said goodbye
And I know whatever you do
I love you

I believe one day you'll see
There is something you've lost forever
'Cause time is a great healer
There's no chance we'll be ever together

Don't you feel the same way like me?
It's the time you have to see
If you leave and I'm left on my own

I've had relations with girls from many nations
I've made passes at women of all classes
And just because you're gay I won't turn you away
If you stick around I'm sure that we can find some common ground

Chorus:
Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free
Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me

A nuclear submarine sinks off the coast of Sweden
Headlines give me headaches when I read them
I had an uncle who once played for Red Star Belgrade
He said some things are really best left unspoken
But I prefer it all to be out in the open

Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free
Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me
Sexuality - Don't threaten me with misery
Sexuality - I demand equality

I'm sure that everybody knows how much my body hates me
It lets me down most every time and makes me rash and hasty
I feel a total jerk before your naked body of work

I'm getting weighed down with all this information
Safe sex doesn't mean no sex it just means use your imagination
Stop playing with yourselves in hard currency hotels
I look like Robert De Niro, I drive a Mitsubishi Zero

Sexuality - Strong and warm and wild and free
Sexuality - Your laws do not apply to me
Sexuality - Come eat and drink and sleep with me
Sexuality - We can be what we want to be"

Something like a chicken coup
Not sure though
I go overdose
And the ghost of my brain
Goes to your's
And something comes quite clear

Smoke is her name but she'll grow
Can't stop the rain nor the snow, no

Am I talking 'bout
The medicine, the legal thing
You eat when you are sick
Am I falling out
Of sight design beyond the red house road
I move too quick

She's got real big bones
And a gorgeous home
And between her, um
And me there's something quite good I love

Smoke is her name but she'll grow
Can't stop the rain nor the snow
I dream, dream, dream
But don't look
Look, look, look, no I
Dream, dream, dream
But don't look
Love, love, love

She's a buzzing bee
She's a person see
Between you and me
Someone I want bad
But can't have
I'm an overgrown
Little wanting boy
She's my only joy
And covers come between us to clear

Smoke is her name but she'll grow
Can't stop the rain nor the snow

116,Shudder To Think,About Three Dreams,TRIWMJZ12903CD7E15,1991,"Time slows I doze. In a bath of cream and ink a vacant girl smiles, and all around
her toys move. The water is crazy blue. The water is crazy blue. Above, nine
doves water her with sleep. There's a stripping child show, and from the ceiling
thumbs snow. The sky is crazy blue. The sky is crazy blue. Croquet-Sunday, and
all the balls I sink are really sunsets so all around me night flies. The stars are
crazy blue. The stars are crazy blue. Dreams mean my brain's on break. It takes
my day and starts to say a fable. A no rules game, rearrange reigns. Takes my
whims and swims circles 'round sense. Cockroaches climb the clocks and the
cuckoos are all Jewish. We're naked except for the plaided patch you're stitching
into my groin. ""Don't stop me,"" you say, ""this is something I've been needing to
do for a long time."" ""All right,"" I reply. Then I'm kissing you in a long blue boat;
it's a plastic yacht, with Chicanos on deck. They bail the jellyfish from the boat
and then drink it. ""It's the only way to keep them from stinging the tourists,"" one
man says. The air is icy-cold, but we are happy, we are getting married. Now it's
the desert at dusk. The sky is blue chrome. I pick one sequin from your dress and
then kiss it. I put the sequin into the sky. ""That's my star,"" I say. ""And I'm your
cowboy."""

Rarely do friends come and then go
She was a girl, soft but estranged
We were the two, our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Raised by my dad, girl of the day
He was my man, that was the way
She was the girl left alone
Feeling the need to make me her home

I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

118,New Model Army,The Charge (Live),TROOSUY128F145B7D3,1991,"Our history speaks in thunder from a thousand village halls
In blood and sweat and sacrifice, in honouring every call
So the forces gathered against the thorn a-piercing in their side
A brave new world is beckoning so the olden world must die. 
In the offices of the city, at all the tables of oak and power
The snares are laid and baited for the approaching of the hour
A hundred justifications and the presses are ready to roll
The gateways to the nation they are firmly under control 

Ch: On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back
We went galloping down the blackened hills
And into the gaping trap
The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead
Into the valley of death rode the brave hundreds

We called for some assistance from the friends that we had known
But this is the 1980s and we were on our own
We never felt like heroes or martyrs to a cause
Just battle-weary soldiers in a bloody civil war 

The massacre now is over and the order new enshrined
While a quarter of the nation are abandoned far behind
Their leaders offer the cliché words, so righteous in defeat
But no one needs morality when there isn't enough to eat
The unity bond is broken and the loyalty songs are fake
I'll screw my only brother for even a glimpse at a piece of the cake
We only cry in private here behind the shuttered glass
When we think of the charge of this brigade, the severing of the past 

Ch: On, on, on, cried the leaders at the back
We went galloping down the blackened hills
And into the gaping trap
The bridges are burnt behind us and there's waiting guns ahead
Into the valley of death rode the brave hundreds"

The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it),""
MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing
with the same ol' swing
with the same ol' ending
the same ol' climax
cause many have no vertebrae
yo, but D-E-L &amp; HIEROGLYPHICS have to murder a
fraudulent foe real quick
and get them off of our dicks
show the public that they ass ain't slick
they lack skills
and they can only thrill ya by dance steps
I coulda iced Vanilla, but I haven't got the chance yet
but that's ok
cause he was dissed on Soul Train
he got booed because his rhymes are so lame
he ain't the only one
he's far from it
there's more on Earth
and they're all gonna plummet
like falling stars
because a brother's in charge
I'ma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge
then charge to the front of the class
suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo
but I'ma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow named X
and a pillow
to sock the pussy willows
while I get dough as I grow as a rhymer
and they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima
it's the same ol' thing...

I'm in your face with force
to eliminate monotonous
braggin' &amp; boastin' so most will end up profitless
cause they ain't got a foot to stand on
and I'ma leave the stage bloodier than a Tampon
I can't get no rest
because of gamin' little pests
will step &amp; try to test me with the same ol' thing
I wish it would stop
but more than likely it will not
cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing
so I change &amp; rearange rhyme patterens
keep ya mind scatterin'
from the solar system
and I still dissed 'em
the ones with the CRUMBS on they lips
talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist
and I get the gist
so don't play me like a imbecile
thinkin' that ya large
but ya small as a thimble
plus I get mantal over funky tracks
and ya still talkin' Sucka MCs?
That shit is wack
if I ever dissed an MC
it was one with a name
so don't tell me he was one in the same
because I know better
I flow better than the average Joe
I use my nubian stick to overthrow that same ol' thing...

MCs out there got the same ol' thing
got the sameol' game
and trip, some got the same ol' name
like Rockmaster This
Mighty Kingathat
who died &amp; left you the Wolfman, Jack?
But the Boogiemen are irregular
spactacular, dracula
and plus we're gettin' clever
I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title
and I won't add a (rah!) or a (huh!) at the end of my recital
hip hop hibbit
I never say a rhyme like that
cause I can take my time &amp; give it
thought, so I went  &amp; bought
a pen &amp; pad
now I'm makin' MCs real mad
like Young MC
goin' out like Sugar Hill
add a new beat
new rhyme (huh!)

I started thinking that it's wearing on my soul
But I got to get it getting tonight

Raindrops keep fallin' on my window - pain!
They make my company
I can hear them knocking on my door
Now, should I let them in?

When I look at the faces baby
You see how the other side dies
I've got to - got to - got to
Let them come on in

Your lip service getting
Right out of order
Better keep looking
Or I'll blow my cover

She'll get caught by big sister midnight
I've been only telling stories
You will only tell me lies

I get the picture cause you never got my soul!
I get it, handed back, it turns into a tray of gold
That's just a victim of the promises you told
I sit and count the cost of living tonight

Bottle the past and number the label
Drink to the future, girl be ready and able
Get a grip with a new fixation
And take them all and let them all in

When I look at their faces baby
I see how the other side dies
I got to - got to - got to
Let them all come in

Should I let them (all come in)

Neon lights don't never dim
In the kind of bars that never close
In a back room game T. Jim yells
""Saint Gabriel, I'm gonna steal the show.""

He slapped his cards down on the table
Said, ""Boys, I got me a winning hand.""
But the sight that made old T. Jim tremble
Was the king that took his land.

Mister, meet your new landlord
Heard you knockin' upon my door
Mister, meet your new landlord
Plenty of room down on the floor.

With a ticket burning in his hand
And the tip still ringing in his ear
Big Pete bet his whole life savings 
As the race was drawing near.

A shot was fired
The gates flew open
The years streaked right before his eyes
Too bad they were riding on a saddle from the moment of ill advice.

Mister, meet your new landlord
I heard you knockin' upon my door
Mister, meet your new landlord
Plenty of room down on the floor.

Other names and other places
Different rules, but it's all the same
Cause If that bug ever bites you
The scar will bear you shame.

Hey listen, son, you know you're in trouble
When you wake up one morning in a daze
And as you peer into the mirror
The face leaning over says

Mister, meet your new landlord
I heard you knockin' upon my door
Mister, meet your new landlord
Got plenty of room down on the floor.

Mister, meet your new landlord
I heard you knockin' upon my door
Mister, meet your new landlord

Vanished life, bequeathed.

Knock on coffin, shallow burial.
Emerge enslaved, commands obeyed.

Vision in the shroud, effect of curare.
Silence gives consent, killing which you bear.

Face rivers of tears - slave to kill.
Slow grab for soil - uncontrollable will.

Moving the earth - arising from the ground.
Choking unpleasantness - a gurgling sound.

Staggering around, catatonic hellish dance.
Animation fades, into hypnotic trance.

Held back from the gorge, your spirit bound in chains.
Death cannot be reached, (with the) curare in your veins.

Homage to your master, destiny controlled.
Sorrow at your fate, no feelings felt, this story untold."

Friends and relations, send salutations

To be with the one you -- the one you really love

I've been jacked by the racist scum, and here I come
Klan, run - cause revenge is fun!  And I'm that one
to make you tapdance with a shotgun
On Donahue they said they had weapons
Just to teach black people one lesson
but I ain't goin to your school of fools
so come here, and look at my tools!
You can meet and greet the Glock 19 in your nostrils
I'll splatter your dreams
Plans to overthrow are left in limbo
cause one loco bro chose to dispose of you
and your skinhead crew
I ain't a house nigga with a twenty-two
I dump a hollow-point slug in your windpipe
Try to breathe {*choking*} believe the hype
Cause this ain't the jungle fool
and I don't throw SPEARS, and I ain't leavin here!
A Nazi and you ain't never SEEN Germany
but you was lookin for a enemy
So you found a young brother with cash
crashed my glass, snatched my whole stash
Boy I'ma getcha back, like it ain't no thang
Show you what I learned from the gangs
Stack em up deep in a six-nine Deuce
Long range scopes for the whole damn group
Hangin outside a club called Moonshine
Waitin for the right time..
There he is, walkin in the Levi's blue cut
The Wicked One dropped two shots in his butt
I can't solve racism with a gat
but this is where my head's at - get em with a jack back!

""You ask me the niggers around here
been treated awful bad for a long time..""

I've been sayin this, I gotta fix em
I wanna fix em with a crucifixion
Nail em to a cross and burn em
BURN EM BURN EM BURN EM!
It's been said that this would happen
Skanless skinheads jackin
All up in the crib insult for takin my force
I had to break North
The leader had a spraypaint can
and on my wall wrote, 'Death to the black man'
Burned a cross in front of the hideout
Hopin they could get my race to die out
I'ma cause em PAIN, physical and mental
I speak slowly - through the temple
The Wicked One is talkin trouble
Blastin skulls into pieces of puzzle
Damage em so bad, they can't stop me
Not enough body left to get an autopsy
Skinheads, stakin em out
Bloodshed, takin em out
Caught one of em, Mix said, ""Go ahead""
Thirty-eight, STRAIGHT to his forehead
I hit em hard and it hit the spot
I punish and plot with Mix-a-Lot
Now where's the leader at?  Gotta get him back
Gotta get the gat, gotta get the axe
Call it a revengeful murderous pact..
call it the jack back!

""Some things are worth killing for""

(Sir Mix-a-Lot)
They burned a cross in my yard, caught a brother off guard
but I can't cry, cause I'm HARD!
They jacked another black, but this black wants payback
I rack up killin stats!
Now I'm on the hunt with a 12-gauge pump
Massive hardware's in my trunk
Creepin low.. and slow
There's one - roll down the window
Whassup, FOOL?!!  (""Noooooooooo!!"") *buck buck buck*
It ain't done til the punk stops breathin;
watch Kunta Kinte get even!
It goes like that when a brother stays strapped
Couldn't get a job so I learned to rap
Livin kinda large and the skinheads hate me
Run up in my house and they tried to take me
Now I got the metal to his dome
A Desert Eagle, dipped in chrome
I got a black stocking cap yanked over my face
Anger is takin rationality's place
Hitler's in the house and I'm takin him out
He shouts but the barrel's in his mouth
Before I shoot, he wants to know if I'm white or black
I yank my mask - this has been a jack back!

""These boys were trained activists..""

(The Wicked One)
I'm not a slave but the Ku Klux Klan
and the Aryan Nation say I am!
What's behind the skinheads out to getcha?
The reincarnation of Hitler
Now I got a murderous attitude
I'm in a put em in a casket mood!
Remember the days of slavery?
They hung many black men from a tree
We fought to be free real hard
and the black man's freedom must not be scarred!
Callin me an African Sambo
but after this, ""American Psycho""
And I'll smoke any skinhead racist
with the black glock that's in my fist
And the morgue'll be packed in body stacks
Memories due to the jack back
Caught the leader of the skinhead clan
You know the one with the spraypaint can
Drilled him with a crowbar {*gargling*} DIE!
In the left ear, out the right eye
Then I took a knife to his chest
Carved a wicked message in a bloody mess
It was a warning for the rest of his pack

You've been here, you're still here

It's dark outside
I've been away from home too long
I see a light, you've left it on while I've been gone

I can't forget, can't forget

You're still here
And I am reminded of another love that I once knew
You're still here longing for the day
That you can hold me close
Oh Lord you know, never meant to let you go
You've been here, you're still here

So much time has passed between us
But you kept calling out my name, out my name

You're still here

You're still here longing for the day

Zika nor nama ... hesah!

Through this hourglass 
Sands are running fast
In deserted plains 
Kingdoms write their names 
On these burning sands 
Kingdoms show their hands 
In these killing fields 
Soldiers show their steel 
The men who play the gods of war 
They stay behind the guarded door 
And hostages who seek release 
They're crying out to keep the peace 

Holding on... Holding on 
One day we will be free, one day if we're strong 
Holding on... Holding on 
Through the shadows cast to a brighter day 

In these fields of stone 
Far away from home 
In this vale of tears 
The men who play the gods of war 
They stay behind the guarded door 
Religious leaders teachin' hate 
Praise the war and call it fate"

To push us together
Then pull us apart

But I dream about you

I'll always love you

It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace
No

It's like the pattern below the skin
You gotta reach out and pull it all in
And you feel like you're too close
But you swallow another dose

The pinnacle of happiness
Filling up your soul
You don't think you can take any more
You never wanna let go

To touch the roots of experience
The most basic ingredients
To see the unseen glitter of life
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife

Cherish the certainly of now
It kills you a bit at a time
Cradle the inspiration
It will leave you writhing on the floor

This is so unreal, what I feel
This nourishment, life is bent
Into a shape I can hold
A twist of fate, all my own
Just grit your teeth, make no sound
Take a step away and look around
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
The whisper is but a shout
That's what it is all about
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away

Like the sacred song that someone sings through you, through you
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into, into
Like the dream you know one day will come to life
Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger, stronger

It's the jewel of victory
The chasm of misery
And once you have bitten the core
You will always know the flavor

The split second of divinity
You drink up the sky
All of heaven is in your arms
You know the reason why

It's right there, all by itself
And what you are, there is nothing else
You're growing a life within a life
The lips of wonder kiss you inside

And when it's over the feeling remains
It all comes down to this
The smoke clears, I see what it is
That made me feel this way

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
The essence of the truth

The perfect moment
That golden moment
I know you feel it too

I know the feeling
It is the real thing
You can't refuse the embrace

This is so unreal, what I feel
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood
Pump through your veins, can't explain
The element that's everything
Just clench your fist and close your eyes
Look deep inside, hypnotize
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away
You will never let it slip away

Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after
Like the first time love urged you to take it's guidance, in silence
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending

I know
I know
I know"

Not the end of the world knockin' at the door 
So close your eyes and dream again 
Believe me, It's only the wind"" 

Everytime I'e had to face a bitter storm of life 
Those words of comfort were my shelter in the night 
But tonight I don't believe I'm able to pretend 
The storm that you and I are up against is only the wind 

I can hear you downstairs and you're just about to leave 
There's nothing else that I can do to keep you here with me, no 
And now the screen door's slammin' and I'm frightened once again 
What I wouldn't give if I could be convinced 

It's only the wind, and nothing more 
Not the end of the world walking out the door 
I wish that I could dream again 
Believin' it's only the wind

We simply follow
Rhythms that are distant echoes
Ancestors turning in their sleep
Silhouetted on the future, playful figures that cut
Across the winking eye of God's projector
A partial eclipse of the original light that
Emanates in all directions
So that darkness isn't pierced but rather
Forced to retreat
Pushed out by its own internal explosion
The screen of God's movie is time expanding
And every atom is a solid globular mirror in which
His grotesque anamorphic grin splits the darkness 
Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control

Looking into the future
Is looking at the past
In whichever direction you happened to face
You were forward and I was slipping back
In the time it takes for the light of the -stars-
To stir-the retina-rods and cones
History's in the beholder's eye
A fait accompli dans une autre endroit
The further away we are, the farther back we see,
Unless we could gaze, instantly across the sound
Where, moored like ships, planets anchored
Swing and sway-golden barges
Laden down with mist and frozen crystals
Dancing away

Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control"

Lies the wounded, 
The shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence 
Of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me please for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Tell me when the kiss 
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear 
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

All the precious times 
Have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day 
When I'm tortured in my trust
And watch it crystalize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm
I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

Tell me when the kiss 
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear 
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room"

I'm not afraid what you might say
No, I'm not scared of you

Loving you was then so easy
Never wanted you to leave me
Then I saw what you were like
Inside
Maybe one day we can sit
And be ourselves and reminisce
But right now I'm afraid
That I'd just cry, just cry

When the wind was a whistlin' round

You give your good one mattress
Up to aunt Lizzie and uncle Fred
Too many kinfolks on a bad night
So you went to the foot of the bed

I could always wait till the old folks
Had an eating believings with grace
The teacher could keep me after school
I'd still have a smile on my face

I could wear the big boys worn out clothes
And let sister have my sled
But I'd always did get my nanny goat
To sleep at the foot of the bed

Was fine enough when the kinfolks come
And the kids brought brand new games
You could see how fat all the old folks
Was and learn all the babies names

Had biscuits and custard and chicken pie
We all got Sunday fed
But I'd know darn well when nighttime come
I was heading for the foot of the bed

They say some folks don't know
What it is having company all over the place
To wrestle for cover on a winter night
With a big foot sitting in your face

Or a cold toenail just a scratching your back
And the foot boards grabbing your head
I'll tell the world you ain't lost a thing
Never a sleepin' at the foot of the bed

I've done it over and over again
In this land of the brave and the free
And in this awful battle of life
It's left it's mark on me

For I'm always a struggling around
At the foot instead of forging ahead
And I don't think it's caused from a dog
Gone thing but a sleepin' at the foot of the bed"

My mother wanted me to make another song
Something brand new so she could dance to, too

Come come come again

Oh so you want to learn how to play ludi
So you have to get this man around a board
Its similar to game they call Sorry!
But if I was playing Sorry! I would be so sorry
Sometimes I might sound confusing
Yes, but in the end I am sure you will find
That makes my style original from the rest
That's why you call callout ""Rewind!""
Now that means to take you back to the top to start up again
That means the song is a 10 out a 10
That means to ""come come come again!""
And me and you are now friends
And my partner says I am very bombastic
In rap but ask me I don't know what it means
Well I don't communicate because the generation gap

I only have my memories to last me the remainder of my days
For time has now decided that we must go our individual ways
The warmth I feel inside can more than overcome my loss
But this is me today and tomorrow I must count the cost.

We'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb.

The pleasures of a lifetime condensed into a fleeting glimpse of truth, mmm
A moment of delight as when a child receives a sixpence for a tooth
The simple things in life mean more to me than money ever buys
The greatest thing for me to see my love reflected in your eyes.

We'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb.

We'll meet again sometime though the way is never clear
My sacrifice is made, everything that I hold dear
We'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb.

Oh lover of a lifetime let me look upon your loveliness alone
But I cannot gaze too long for I fear that it will turn me into stone
A monument to life that will stand forever by your grave
Inscribed for all to see, a message of respect : ""Be brave"".

For we'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb
We'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb
We'll meet again sometime though the road is steep and very hard to climb."

Touch can mean prison or be like a cage

Specially in this day and age

The world's getting weird the wolf's running free
But that's another story this their story

Babes in the wood eager and keen
Soft as the fern underneath them
Wet to the skin from their own hot glow
No more wolf at the window

Touch can mean distance to some people
Touch can mean I own you forever and a day
If only life could be more simple

Touch can bring blossom to things that decay
I think life should be that simple

I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

From the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
Every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife

With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free

I'm mad about you"

But I won't let that worry me,
This love will always be,
It was meant right from the start

How could I help but love you,
With a love so true,
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part,
It wouldn't be your fault, yeah,
It would be all mine

When you hold me close, honey,
You're the most, baby,
You set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, honey,
I had to get you,
You have been my one desire

How could I help but love you,
With a love so so true,
You send cold chills down my spine

If we would ever part"

221,Counting Crows,Shallow Days,TRDIVHN128F42503B1,1991,"Mary Jane says it's all right,
She's just around the corner from the main light,
Any day now it's all right,
She's standing on the precipice of big time,
And I know I'm a little uptight,
And I've got to go before the sun shines,
Yeah we're just a couple small people squeezing out a life,
We need a little good time, it's not far from the edge.

Mary comes and goes,
Drifting through the scenery,
Of the shallow days below,
And as everybody knows,
You follow trains out of town,
And they vanish somewhere under the horizon,
Yeah well I saw Mary Jane,
Dragged her shadow down the tracks,
And fade off in the distance,
It's not far from here, mary waves hello,
Smiling though she's sinking,
In the shallow days below, oh no.

I can't find a way out of here,
Out on the road again,
I'm much, much too concerned,
About Mary Jane,
I'm all alone again,
And I like what she said,
But not what it means,
She leaves me drowning,
Through the shallow days, down below.

You know I heard a band playing waltzes in a grange hall,
The sun is sinking lower,
People staring, Mary Jane humming softly to herself,
But nobody really knows her,
And any day now it's all right,
She tells herself that this will be the last time,
And Mary Jane pulls her hair back,
And wonders what she'll do with all her free time,
Not too far from here, Mary turns to go,
Smiling while the waltz begins,
Dancing down the road, oh no.

Hey, hey Mr. Freedom,
What are we supposed to think?
'Cause I'm a very tiny person,
And it worries me, I'm all alone again,
And I like what she says,
But not what it means,
She leaves me drowning,
In the shallow days, way down below,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm sorry, she said,
I know, it's not the kind of thing you want,
I'm falling, falling down,
I'm sorry, she said,
I know, I'm not the kind of girl you want,
We're falling, oh falling, oh falling, falling down."
222,Larry Norman,I Will Survive,TRLDNKO128F92EF905,1991,"I've had a life of pain and sorrow, 
But I will still be here tomorrow

I will survive, I will survive. 

And nothing's gonna stop me knowing 
That love is real, it keeps me going.

I will survive, I will survive.

When the children are hungry I weep for them,  I wanna hold them tight. 
When the shadows grow longer and the cold moves in 
I turn up my collar and walk into the night.  

Come to me my little boy, 
You have given me life's greatest joy. 

I will survive, I will survive. 

This road before us winds beyond the glade 
Some fall dancing the the slow parade 

I will survive, I will survive.

As the season go by in my father's world
My eyes grow dim
I will trust not in the things I see 
But bow my heart and lift my hands to him.  
Temptation beckons or befalls me,
Fear and indecision stalls me.

I will survive, I will survive. 

Illusion shines like diamonds glistening,
My father's watching, he is listening 

I will survive, I will survive.

If you see me walking slowly like a man who's blind
If you speak and I do not look up 
Then you must forgive me but I've got heaven on my mind.  
Though my days ahead are numbered, 
My life is rich, I have not slumbered 

I will survive, I will survive.

Some hearts are pierced by love long lost
Let my heart be pierced by the cross

I will survive, I will survive.  

Friends may come and friends may go
But enemies stay for the late show.

I will survive, I will survive.

Friendships fail and love's elusive 
Life goes quickly, time's abusive.

I will survive, I will survive."

In questa notte di mezzaluna 
Che sarà che mi ha turbato 
In una notte così serena 
Come una mano mi ha interrotto il sonno 
Un'allarme che mi ha rotto un sogno 
O forse un tuono che da lontano 
Viaggia in quest'aria così fina 

Vorrei che almeno ci fosse vento 
Che si sentisse il rumore del mare 
Che si rompesse questo silenzio 
Così assoluto che troppo fà pensare 
Che m'inventassi qualche cosa da fare 
Che ti svegliassi per potere parlare 
Ma stai dormendo profondo 
E non posso nemmeno suonare 

Tra poco l'alba verrà e con l'alba il sole 
E con la luce vedrò che tutto và bene 
A quest'angoscia riuscirò a dare un nome 
E forse mi riaddormenterò 
E ricomincerò a sognare 

Adesso sò cosa mi ha svegliato 
In questa notte così serena 
É la paura che mi venga rubato 
Il futuro da un'avversa fortuna 
Un terremoto, un'improvviso crollo 
Un'evento fuori di controllo 
Come una guerra lontana 
Sotto una luce di mezzaluna 

Tra poco l'alba verrà e con l'alba il sole 
E alla sua luce vedrò che tutto và bene 
A quest'angoscia riuscirò a dare un nome 
Ti guarderò dormire e ti lascierò sognare 

Tra poco l'alba verrà e con l'alba il sole 
E la luce mi dimostrerà che tutto và bene 
Di quest'angoscia ora so qual'é la ragione 
E forse mi riaddormenterò

I met a girl who said she could save me

She said, ""I am a hug
I wrap around you and I scrub
You're made of dirt, my dear
I scrub until you disappear

That's what absolution means""

Three triple bars came up 
We won six hundred bucks

We had sex
I dreamt that I was Evel Knievel

We had sex
I dreamt that I was Evel Knievel

over mountains and through valleys.
I left my body this evening
and forever I will now live.
Curious I travelled through an unknown land,
like an angel that had recently learned to fly.
I left my fear with my body
and with the ravens I flew
on a road, of bleeding clouds, that never seemed to end.
As the road suddenly divided
I heard the ravens whisper:
""Please come, fly with us! Please come, fly with us!""
Confused and insecure I stopped for a while
and beheld the ravens disappear.
Then I heard a voice from the other road:
""This is the path to the golden land!
Come my friend, take my hand!""
But an uncontrolled voice deep in my soul
screamed out: ""I'll go my own way!""
and straight ahead I flew, to continue my voyage
and my search of the land of eternity.
On the road I chose to go
I saw no other men..., 'cause it was my own imagined road
and I was alone to face its destination.
What I saw around me were things I love.
Things that I built with my heart, deep in myself.
The temples I passed were my temples
and the queen that welcomed me was my queen.
My voyage was ended, and surrounded by the most
beautiful flowers I stood beholding my kingdom
I would rule in all the future to come.
As the dawn of the morning swept through my dreamland
to adorn the leafs of the golden trees with dew
and to bring me eternal light, I thought:
""A life is only worth living for a king..."""

gladly break it

this sick romance
They need no chain - it's in our brain
And we don't stand a chance

If we keep doing this deadly dance
End this sick romance
The dance of the dead
It's all in my head

Know the deal, the way we feel - those of us who care
Constant pain, the endless rain becomes
too much to bear
Feel the need to concede - pretend it's all ok
But the horror, today, tomorrow, will never
ever go away

If you give in to the deadly dance
You've got to take that chance
The dance of the dead
It's all in your head

Ain't got the time or peace of mind to deal
with the likes of you
Your narrow views, your two-bit moves just
tell me that you're through
You're dead
You're dead
You're dead

Don't give in, live the sin - let them see the sight
There's no answer in the end - live free, fall or fight
Keep in mind, that you'll find them standing in the way
Run them down to the ground - make the guilty pay

And there'll be no more deadly dance
End their idiot prance
The dance of the dead
It's all in their heads

The dance of the dead
The dance of the dead

Dead"

The night air is cold - the freeway is clear.
In a green Gucci bag - are you prized possessions
The jewels of your mind - to hold back the fear.

And when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill.
And a while blinding light - makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill.

The driveway is long - your princess is lovely
Your servants all wait - for your knock on the door.
How many years - will you crawl through this castle
So satisfied - and still wanting more.

And when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill.
And a while blinding light - makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill.

The guests have arrived - with all the right faces
But you miss the ball - in that room down the hall.
It's sunrise again - the driveway is empty
The crystal is cracked - there's blood on the wall.

And when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome sound
And she follows you down for the kill.
And a while blinding light - makes it all seem so right
And you feel like the king of the hill."

The clock strikes twelve
It feels so soon

Two o'clock, three kicks inFour o'clock
That's when I begin, oh yeah

Through the doors
Through the halls
Down the elevator
To the second floor

Across the bar
In a thin green dress
I catch your smile
And then I said oh God
It's not my bedtime story
Or sience fiction
It's just a matter of fact
If I fall to temptation
It's my decision to turn back
Oh yes, with open eyes in the dark
Oh yeah, we come together
We come together

Soul to soul, I found a love
Soul to soul to soul
Soul to soul to soul, she's got a Gucci love
Soul to soul to soul

Moonswept alibis
Sleepin' away the night
As you and I walk alone
Hand and hand
We cast shadows of love
There's a good thing goin' on
With open eyes
We come together
We come together

It's our song
We sing alone
It's our song
We sing of love

She's got this feelin'
That I can't get enough
It's like strawberry jelly
It's a tough too much
I gotta expert timing
She's skin slappin' love
I can tell you something child
I loose control"

I man well vex
And just have fe big up me chest
Cause the Taxi Driver don't have no respect
Want I fe catch bus hop truck and
Ride bike and stand up on the road
And hitch hike
But you see me...dem deh things can't go on
Cause Natty Dread RIDE THE STORM

Taxi Driver
Won't stop for me
Whenever I flag him down
He won't stop for me

In  a London city and in a New York
There are no go areas after dark
I say muggers on the streets
And thief in the park
Tramps pon the sidewalk
A dem a sky lark
Some a catch the taxi - when they reach 
Their spot
Pretend to pay the driver
And then they just run off
Some a argue with the driver
And say the fare aint right
The next thing you know
They have a kitchen knife

CHORUS
Taxi Driver
Won't stop for me
Whenever I flag him down
He won't stop for me

To hail a cab
You got to be fast
You try to catch a taxi
But they just drive past

DAVID DREAD
The taxi-cab driver never stop for me
They got all kind of excuses up his sleeve
Some say they off duty
Some say they not free
The taxi cab driver never stop for me
Because of my dreadlocks looking wild
They think I'm a mugger of some bad guy
No they never stop they just pass me by
They treat me like a leper
Who's left to die Yo!

Excuse me mate can you get me a taxi
Is that the driver
Boy...Jungle

DJ BUMBO BROWN
You think that bad
Mek I tell you what the brute
Do to me youth
Well I was walking with my son
Who was just a child
And still the Taxi Driver
Won't give me a ride
He was caught by the traffic lights
And had to slow down
So I opened the back door
And sat my son down
So he tried his best to
Stop me from coming in
I say move yourself man
And start your driving
He was very angry
But he asked where to 
I said take me to the station
My train leaving soon
So guess what he did to me
Just for spite
He stopped at every single traffic light
He took the wrong turn
And the long way too
He stopped at the bar
Just to use the loo
When I got to the station
It was all in vain
Good golly good gosh
I say I miss my train

Me kick up the taxi
Me kick up the Taxi Driver
Me lick up the taxi
Me lick up the Taxi Driver
Not stopping
He just not stopping"

Stars before my eyes
I seem to have this fear of the dark
That only love defies
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight
When you snap your fingers and change my fate, baby
Love gets its way and honey I must obey
I'm under the spell
So tough to clear out my head
Comin' down from a night of passion
I blacked out the moment I felt
This could only be love
I'm under the spell 

A physical reaction, the doctors all agree
Disillusion's all in my head
It's so real to me
And I'm walkin' as if in a trance
And I'm talkin' like a man possessed
Makes me wonder if I'll ever get straight
When you snap my fingers and change my fate, baby
You'll get your way - cause honey - I must obey 

I'm under the spell
So tough to clear out my head
Comin' down from a night of passion
I blacked out the moment I felt
This could only be love
I'm under the spell
Starstruck - I stare into space
I see the flash - then I hear the thunder
So shocked - I'm merely a shell
It's stranger than love -
I'm under the spell 

Fools fall in love under the moonlight
Count me as one - under the spell"

A pick axe in my head

I met my sister Sandra
With them jewels and the cross
Eyes on my lever now
She paint with chili sauce

I cannot do no business

Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me

Now you've said
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led

As far as I can see
There's no reason for goodbyes
You're just running scared
And that's something I won't buy

So you lose
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you

I am far too Canadian,

I pick the bones of what's been done,
and I'll lick them clean with a cautious tongue,
in dim lit rooms, I'll spill my guts,
I'm the revolution when the doors are shut,
I bite the hand that slaps me senseless,
but my patience it is.. too relentless,

I am the face of my country,
expressionless and small,
weak at the knees, shaken badly,
can't straighten up at all,
I watch the spine of my country,
bend and break,
I'm in a sorry state,

I scratch the walls to mark the days,
with my coup-de-tete, I am locked away,
with mother Jones, pots of tea,
the kitchen poster, anarchy,

I hold my breath for arbitration,

Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted, is wasted on the young

Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say, what rought us to this miracle we've found

There are those who'd bet
Love comes but once - and yet
I'm oh so glad we met
The second time around

the rising of the souls
here I lie tied to my bed
awaiting the coming of ghouls

I close my eyes as if to die
entering again
the labyrinths of deep within
beyond where conscious ends

Hellish terrors risen
in the mountains of unknown
below the skies of I
sleeps a ruler in his throne

Beneath the collonades of fear
deep below his halls
in the endless realms of I
inside the entombed vaults

The insane watching eye
staring through my bones
shreds the soul out of my skin
and leaves me naked and alone

Although my dreams have ended
as I wished in weakened thought
beyond me night is total
and through the collonades I walk"

The motherf**king saga continues...

All of you who don't believe in the real gangsta shit,
cause when it comes to the real niggaz,
it makes the shit they're much harder to deal with.

Yeah, above the laws in this motherf**ker,
like Mafia for life, down with the real niggaz 4 life.
Ha-ha, yo sweet-talk, tell 'em what the f**k we're here for...

Well I write ya, USE, Compton, Watts, The Wood,
all across the motherf**king USA.
They know I'm walking through the valley of real niggaz,
I should fear no man on the motherf**king planet, hit me one.
Cause I've been to the mountain top y'all,
and I have been seeing through the eyes of a real nigga.

Yo, what you think about the real niggaz 187?

Yo, they make some of the coooooolest shit I had never heard,

Yo, when we came, G, I almost gave it up,
to the ruthless motherf**king gangstas.
Fear no man...

...because you're shit man yourself,
time to put the world at yourself man.
Me not seeing bobba-clot mobbing to see a pussy-clot run,
bob-bob-bob-bob-bob, keep Babylon on the run, see...

Ren:
The real niggaz is back, cause there's to many bullshit records out,
niggaz beat it for what we put out.


But you don't have to wait no longer,
because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger.
So many groups made three albums or more,
and their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store.
They wonder why it never sold,
niggaz rapping since the seventies and still never went gold.
Our first record sold two million copies,
that's because you other motherf**kers are sloppy.
You came out the streets and crossed over,
and after that your career is f**king over.
Because after that you're not around,
so shut the f**k up, and witness the sound of some real niggaz.

Eazy:
Yeah, motherf**ker.
keeping all you busters on the run in ninety-one, kick that shit Ren.

Ren:
Most niggaz can't understand,
and never will if they ain't part of the ruthless Mafia-clan.
Niggaz is dedicated to the streets,
with hyped f**king lyrics and a dope ass beat.
The songs will never come soft, because I come off,
so don't get in my way or motherf**ker you'll be cut off.
And it's something you can move your lips to,
to wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you.
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K,
all day that's with no play.
Cause ain't no rap group out, that I know,
that makes me wanna listen to the radio.
All I hear is motherf**kers trying to make a comeback with lovesongs,
and that shit is whack.
And that's why your ass ain't around,
cause you don't have the motherf**king sound of a real nigga."

Got me hard as a rock
Within a city of sin, she got a city block

She likes to show
So many sides to her
And I'd be the one to know

When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong

Black knight, take a bite
She can double it up
And she's a way of life
And whether dead or alive
She got a fix on me
And I was dancin' in the fire
White steam, never seen
In every muscle and bone
She was a love machine
And she could wrestle me down
And get a taste of me
In her web of desire

She changed my world
How can the body know

False shall be separated from the true

Nocturnal wrath unfolds us...
Melancholic silence surrounds...
Walls are breeding malignant seeds...
The spawn of hate shall be unleashed

Rot to Dead!!!

Face to face - brother against brother
The bitter taste of loss of own ideals
Atmosphere of evil, selfish minds
in a battle which no-one will prevail

Paradoxal tranquillity...
Leads the Fiend out of our minds...
Raging wrath - now weeping sorrow...
But Hate remains in our hearts..."

with vassals and serfs at my side,

I had riches all too great to count
and a high ancestral name.

But I also dreamt which pleased me most
that you loved me still the same,
that you loved me, you loved me still the same,
that you loved me, you loved me still the same.

I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
that knights upon bended knee
and with vows no maiden's heart could withstand,
they pledged their faith to me.
And I dreamt that one of that noble host
came forth, my hand to claim.

But I also dreamt which charmed me most

Well then I guess it's true
You are my reason

Why can't forever be
Forever and nothing more?

After twenty years of killing
Clearing your mind is easy now caught
Death was your life, pain your pleasure
No regrets, emotions are naught
Interrogator vomits
Because of the gore
In the story you tell him
Bile covers the floor
Your first one was a whore
She didn't want intercourse
Spilling your sperm
On her mangled corpse
Loving the killing
Sex no more fun
What would you do
If your dick was your gun

Bisexual lust low way of life
Your true religion was a knife
A trail of corpses left behind
For dismemberment and carnage you strive
They'll send you to the electric chair
Lawyers will defend you but do not care
The victims' parents will not cry
As your body is convulsing, they want you to die
They can't kill your body
But your soul will survive
You'll take control of one's mind
And live an eternal life"

Nie mieszka już Chrystus

Na mojej ulicy

Na mojej ulicy
Żebrak nie rzeźbi swą starczą ręką

Na mojej ulicy
Alkoholicy spijają z kieliszków swe żale
A ich wyśnione
I wymarzone
Śpią w brudnej miłości pościeli...

Okna wpatrzone w sąsiednie bramy
Płoną ze wstydu nocą...

en la arena me escribias
el viento lo fue borrando
y estoy mas solo mirando el mar.

Que lindo cuando una vez
bajo el sol del mediodia
se abrio tu boca en el beso
como el damasco lleno de miel.

Herida la de tu boca
que lastima sin dolor
no tengo miedo al invierno
como tu recuerdo lleno de sol.

Quisiera volverte a ver
sonreir junto a la espuma
tu pelo selto en el viento
como un torrente de trigo y luz.

Yo se que no vuelve mas
el verano en que me amabas
que es ancho y negro el olvido
y entra el otoño en mi corazón."

I display a nuclear ray that'll, destroy bone marrow in cattle
Thereby destroying the entire food supply
that's crawling with AIDS, maggots, flies
It's ironic, when a demonic, government
utilizes bionics and a six million dollar man to capture me
Clever, however; you could never ever begin to apprehend a hologram
Who's determined to fight solely, to defend in wars a land of the holy

Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,

Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

Never knowing my right foot from my left

Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was gettin' G oh for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
and she was guaranteed to give a muthafucka whatever he needs
to be perfectly honest, she was a hooker
So I took her, a hundred yards, to the boulevard
I told her ""I'll take care o' you, you take care o' me""
You got a P.I.M.P. and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggaz were fiendin' yo
She had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact, she was like Medusa
Her tities fully grown
A look and your dick turns to stone yeah
keepin' on mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy 
Fuckin' with Dre, she'll be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho' but wouldn't you know
the bitch tried to gank me
so, I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed
I was thinking the worst, but yo, I had to let my niggaz fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the 44 yo
Then I straight smoked the ho'
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft, so she paid the cost
to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turns out

Now Vicky, Vicky, Vicky, she's very tricky
She put her hicky on top of my dick
Sick bitch, see? 
She told me she loved me, and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said I'm with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this 
She said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo, she wrote a check, many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P.A.I.D.
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo! Everything was cool, but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So, before he found out he was crossed up
By this bitch I was fuckin', I had her tossed up
And put to sleep
So nigga never forget, a dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit!
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turned out

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

[Muthafuckin' right!]

One less,
One less,

Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
'Cause I said ""fuck it!""
Loced and choked and spoked to the ho' like this :
""Bitch, it's all about Dre
The money, money, money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me
And remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lame and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggaz knew that she was someone
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the whole act would be done
So what?
One less bitch you gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out..

(MC Ren)
Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight pull the muthafuckin' trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin' up short
In the vault, but the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with another nigga countin' my cash
I shoulda knew she was like them other ho's
I told them two muthafuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up the 9 so they could'nt refuse
I shot the nigga he was outta there
And tied the bitch to the muthafuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out!

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

(Easy E)
In reality -
A fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches,
And all bitches are created equal.
To me, all bitches are the same:
Money hungry skanless groupie ho's 
That's always riding on a nigga's dick.
Always in a nigga's pocket.
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind.
To me...ALL BITCHES AIN'T SHIT!
