0,B.B. King,(I'm Gonna) Quit My Baby,TRNHOMZ128F92E1DEA,1957,"Well, I work hard everyday
Come home straight with my pay
My baby either drink it up
Or she threw it all away

I'm gonna quit my baby
If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'
Well, I would rather be alone
Than to be worried out of my mind

Well, I give her all of my money
I think I'm being kind
She buy a quart of bad whiskey

And the rest is beer and wine

Well, a few nights ago
I had to work kinda late
Somebody broke out of my house
Just like he was Superman's mate

Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block
The little moonshine joint and the rest just begin to rock
I sneaked inside to get a better view
I caught my baby doin' the mambo too"
1,Billie Holiday,Day In Day Out,TRDKWYW128EF351724,1957,"Day in - day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out - day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain - come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in - day out"
2,Bo Diddley,Who Do You Love,TRWNGFK128F147B858,1957,"I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide

I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a walk with me, Arlene
And tell me, who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Tombstone hand and a graveyard mine
Just 22 and I don't mind dying

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I rode around the town, use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene, don't give me no lip

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Night was dark, but the sky was blue
Down the alley, the ice-wagon flew
Heard a bump and somebody screamed
You should have heard just what I seen

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Arlene took me by my hand
She said, ""Oohwee Bo, you know I understand.""

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?"

Mama gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

Oh (hush your mouth!)

But you've been talkin' to someone else

Further on up the road, someone gonna hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road, baby you just wait and see

9,Bobby Helms,Jingle Bell Rock,TRWXINV12903CA0F1B,1957,"Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock 
Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time 
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock

10,Bobby Troup,My Ship,TRFIZJW128F930E8CE,1957,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me."

Everyday, it's a-gettin' faster
Everyone said, ""Go ahead and ask her""

True love from me?

14,Chuck Berry,No Money Down,TRVFMAE128F424A15F,1957,"As I was motivatin'
Back in town
I saw a Cadillac sign
Sayin' ""No Money Down""
So I eased on my brakes
And I pulled in the drive
Gunned my motor twice
Then I walked inside
Dealer came to me
Said ""Trade in your Ford
And I'll put you in a car
That'll eat up the road
Just tell me what you want
And then sign on that line
And I'll have it brought down to you
In a hour's time""

I'm gonna get me a car
And I'll be headed on down the road
Then I won't have to worry
About that broken-down, raggedy Ford

""Well, Mister, I want a yellow convertible
Four-door de Ville
With a Continental spare
And a wide chrome wheel
I want power steering
And power brakes
I want a powerful motor
With a jet off-take
I want air condition
I want automatic heat
And I want a full Murphy bed
In my back seat
I want shortwave radio
I want TV and a phone
You know I gotta talk to my baby
When I'm ridin' alone""

Yes, I'm gonna get that car
And I'm gonna head on down the road
Yeah, then I won't have to worry
About that broken-down, raggedy Ford

""I want four carbeurators
And two straight exhausts
I'm burnin' aviation fuel
No matter what the cost
I want railroad air horns
And a military spark
And I want a five-year guarantee
On everything I got
I want ten dollar deductible
I want twenty dollar notes
I want thirty thousand liability""
That's all she wrote

I got me a car
And I'm headed on down the road
No money down
I don't have to worry
About that broken-down, raggedy Ford"

My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Can not be denied

They said, some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has blown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has blown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes"
19,Eartha Kitt,C'est Si Bon,TRBJLFT128E078F6AC,1957,"C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good

C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh, so good

Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon

Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
C'est si bon!"

In Spain, the best upper sets do it

Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish, do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks em I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter bring me
""shad roe""

In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love"

In Portugal with you
When we discovered romance
Like we never knew

My head was in the clouds
My heart went crazy too
And madly I said
""I love you""

This sad reality
To know it couldn't be
That's Portugal and love
In April

The music and the wine
Convinced me you were mine
But it was just the spring
Fooling me

I found my April dream
In Portugal with you
When we discovered romance
Like we never knew

Then morning brought the rain
And now my dream is through
But still my heart says
""I love you""

All alone, I can hold her tight

So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I started to drag
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock

When she calles me up on the telephone
Said c'mon over honey,  I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
But I couldn't stay away

So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm ready to drag
Fifteenth floor I started to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock

Well, they sent to Chicago for repairs
'Till it's a-fixed I'm using the stairs
Hope they hurry up before it's too late
Want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is gettin' me down
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail

Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I'm reading Missus Glyn!

I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until that thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still"
27,Ella Fitzgerald,Lover,TRHMWUV12903CEB2DA,1957,"Lover, when I'm near you and I hear you speak my name
Softly, in my ear, you breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing, keep on glancing, in my eyes
Till love's own entrancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender, fears depart
Lover, I surrender, to my heart

(instrumental bridge)

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel, with our bliss
When two lips of coral want to kiss

I say the devil is in you, and to resist you, I try
But if you didn't continue, I would die

28,Ella Fitzgerald,Give It Back To The Indians,TRHOHEV12903CEB2CB,1957,"Old Peter Minuet had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhatten
For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze and they threw in the Bronx and Staten
Pete thought that he had the best of the bargin but the poor red man just grinned,
And he grunted ""ugh!"" meaning okay in his jargon for he knew poor Pete was skinned.
We've tried to run the city....but the city ran away...
And now Peter Minuet
We can't continue it...

Broadway's turning into Coney,
Champagne Charlie's drinking gin,
Old New York is new and phony
Give it back to the Indians!

Two cents more to smoke a Lucky,
Dodging busses keep you thin,
Now New York is simply ducky,
Give it back to the Indians!

Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
Whites on Fifth Avenue
Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
Big bargain today...Chief take it away!

Come you busted city slickers,
Better take it on the chin
Father Nick has lost his knickers
Give it back to the Indians!

29,Ella Fitzgerald,There's A Small Hotel,TRCACCL128F14993F5,1957,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three.  For ...

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I
wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people -- who
wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together"
30,Ella Fitzgerald,Bewitched,TRBZDNX12903CE3331,1957,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis.  Your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more"

Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.

But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I've got,
I won't waste any time,
I'll strike while the iron is hot.

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk, and whisper, and look.
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget.

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot.
And the world discovers
As my book ends,
How to make two lovers
Of friends.

Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver
The Lorelei

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I'm full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I'm treacherous, yeah-yeah
Oh, I just can't hold myself in check
I'm lecherous, yeah-yeah
I want to bite my initials on a sailor's neck

I try to give a party but the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
So I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned, sent an Air Mail Special, too
You answer was ""Goodbye"", there was even postage due
I fell in love just once and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

I've never drawn a sweepstake or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time I'd won but Lady Luck said ""No""
And though it breaks my heart, I'm not surprised to see you go

58,Frank Sinatra,The Night We Called It a Day,TRRVHFI12903CB3A27,1957,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day
Soft through the dark


The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than i
The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day"

Chicago, Chicago I will show you around - I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man, he danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago my home town

Chicago, Chicago that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago I'll show you around - I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The LAUGH that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura
But she's only a dream"

62,Frank Sinatra,Love Locked Out,TRXVUQW12903CB215D,1957,"Love locked out in all the cold and rain,
Love locked out may never come again,
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears,
But no one ever hears love calling.
Though we need the precious gift it brings,
We don't heed the song of love it sings,
On the door love beats its tiny wings,
Just love locked out.
A world without love is a world without life,
A sad world full of gloom,
So please make a place there for love in your heart,
It does not need much room.
Love is well worth the waiting for,
When it comes knocking at your door,
Fling it wide, for love locked out will come
No more, no more."
63,Frank Sinatra,Night And Day,TRKSDEO12903CAB52C,1957,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Day and night

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you

Night and day
You are one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are

Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you

To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style
They read it in the Tea Leaves and it's written in the sand
I found love by the heartful in the foreign distant land
Tell the homefolks that I'm happy with someone that's true I know
I love a pretty Geisha girl where the ocean breezes blow

I have stood and watched the sunrise from the waters of the sea
And wondered how much beauty in this whole world can there be
My dreams are all worth dreaming and it makes my life worth while
To see my pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style

A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day. 

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar. 

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child 
Not a single room was in sight.

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day. 

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born.

A cheval sur un beau nuage

Devant la porte il est resté
N'osons montrer tout son chagrin
A ses copains auréolés

Qui criaient et pleuraient
Tout en se moquant de lui.

Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle pense à toi
Effeuillons l'aile d'un ange
Pour voir si elle t'aimera

Mais le Bon Dieu lui vint en aide
Car les barbus sont syndiqués
Il changea l'étoile en planète
Et fit de Saint Pierre un portier
Et de ces anges déplumés
Par les amours du bon Saint Pierre
Afin de tout récupérer
Il fit les démons de l'enfer

A l'heure où naissent les nuits

Whether we are saved or, whether all is well;
They say we only can hope and, trust that it is so,
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know.

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (yes, He saved my soul),
The very moment He forgave me (yes, He made me whole);
He took away my heavy burden (yes, He took my sin and),
And He gave me peace within (gave me peace within).
Satan can't make me doubt it (he can't make me doubt it),
It's real and I'm gonna shout it (I'm gonna shout it);
'Cause I was there when it happened (oh, my Lord),
And I guess I ought to know (yes, I ought to know).

Now, I don't care who tells me, salvation is not real,
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel;
The heavy burdens lifted and the vile sins go,
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know."
87,Johnny Cash,Next In Line,TRGQSYF128F92E3A0F,1957,"The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, 'cause it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line

The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waitin' for your love
I'm tired and we're runnin' short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, 'cause I'm the next in line

I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break 'em one by one
My time is comin', so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waitin' way behind
It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line"
88,Johnny Cash,Big River,TRGAXOG128F9315BE9,1957,"Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I shed for my baby are gonna flood you Big River.
And I don't care if I sit here and die.

Well I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up ??? heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
But then I heard that my dream was Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, cause you called.

Well you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now  I rolled into Natchez the next day, down the river,
But there wasn't much there to make a rounder stay very long,
She got moving in her blood (???) and I got it all from you
Big River, why you make that gal that way

Well now, batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, bat it down.
You got my Baby take her own down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Let her go I've had enough dump the blues down in the Gulf
It's you she loves Big River it ain't me

Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the cloud how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I shed for my baby are gonna flood you Big River.
And I don't care if I sit here till die.nd wanting

89,Johnny Cash,The Night Hank Williams Came To Town,TRHFGXQ128F9306A7A,1957,"Harry Truman was our president
A coke an burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

""I Love Lucy"" debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town.

Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night HANK WILLIAMS came to town.

A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper; ""Hey, that's him""
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town.

On and on he sang into the night
'Jambalaya', 'Cheatin' heart', 'I saw the light'
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said; ""He sure is humble for a Grand Ole Opry Star.""
Mavis said: ""Why don't we hang around
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town.""

While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Driftin' Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite profound
On the night Hank Williams came to town.

Radio announcer's voice in the background:

Remember, friends and neighbors, Hank Williams and all the Drifting
Cowboys will be at the high school gym in person for one show only
this Saturday night. The big 2 hour show starts at 7:30 - tickets are
just a dollar-fifty each; you get your money's worth the first 15 minutes
and the rest is free. That's Saturday night - advance tickets are on sale
now at Renfrow's Drugstore, Do-Nut Heaven and here at the radio station.

And I ain't seen the sunshine since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin', on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin', in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee, and smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin', and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, blow my blues away"

For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down brush my teeth
Shine up slick up dress up neat
Get everything looking just right

'Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there lookin' my best

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs feed the cows and chop all the logs

In the sun and the sand, with a face that's tan
But at the end of the day, when your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun

Country boy, ain't got no ill
Country boy, ain't got no bill
You get a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right,
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, how I wish I was you and you was me

Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You gotta plant all the seed, you gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time, and your work is through
There's alot of life in you

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a hollow log
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone

If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin' 
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin', when's she comin' home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And then I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin' 
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
'Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know I'll keep on lovin' you, 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind, but I guess I never will

He's the greatest cowboy of them all
He loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
And he'll lift up any maverick that falls
He sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise
He'll call up all the riders in the sky
I gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
That winds up where old cowboys never die
The trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
And he rides point for all the great and small
He will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset...

Gonna sing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord.

Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time.

And when they're blue enough

And if you fail, they're gonna fade, you lose

About the blues, I know the blues

They serve you memories on a plate of tears
They know your appetite will last for years
You can't refuse
You join the club and gotta pay your dues

When you hang your hat in heartbreak hall
Your win broken dreams must crawl
And your gloom will continue to grow
Until there's nothing that you don't know

About the blues, about the blues

You can't look forward to the day your free
You look but yesterday is all you see
Don't buy a book about it, just ask me
About the blues

118,Louis Armstrong,You're The Top,TRHSPYK128F1499EA1,1957,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"".

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P.

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher,

Before we oughta been parted.
Hadn't said one single word,

""Think we ought to be parted.""
And just as soon as I said the word,
She packed all her clothes and started.

And filled up my bathtub with switches.
She let me know right from the start
She was gonna wear my britches.

Greensleeves was my heart of Gold
and who but my Lady Greensleevevs

My men were clothed all in green
and they did ever wait on thee
All this was gallant to be seen
and yet thou would not love me

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing
but still thou hadst it readily
Thy music still to play and sing
and yet thou would not love me

Greensleeves was my delight
Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my Heart of Gold
and who but my Lady Greensleeves

Alas my love you do me wrong
to cast me off discourteously
and I have loved you so long
Delighting in thy company"

I keep weeping and crying every time I think of you
I would rather die of starvation, perish out in the desert sun
I would rather die of starvation, perish out in the desert sun
Than to think of some other man holding you in his arms

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black moustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said ""Tell me dad, when does the fun begin?""
He just winked his eye and said ""Man, be cool""

He wears a red bandana, plays a blues pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black moustache

All of a sudden in walks this chick
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
She started dancin' with the castanets

I didn't know just what to expect
She threw her arms around my neck
We started dancin' all around the floor
And then she did a dance I never saw before

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in Mexico
And you wanna get straight
Man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

That you can red ham and a pone or cornbread
A little dab of soft gravy and that ain't all
They bring you biscuits in a bucket, you can have a ball

A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin
Look a-there Look a-there
Look a-there Look a-there

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name What's your name
What's your name What's your name

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, ""You'd better leave my daughter alone""

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin'
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind"
166,The Coasters,Down In Mexico,TRFMHQV128F92FE685,1957,"Down in the Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said ""Tell me man, when does the fun begin?""
He just winked his eye and said ""Man, be cool.""

He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

(In Mexico)
All of a sudden in walks this chick
(In Mexico)
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
(In Mexico)
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
(In Mexico)
She started dancin' with the castanets
(In Mexico)
I didn't know just what to expect
(In Mexico)
She threw her arms around my neck
(In Mexico)
We started dancin' all around the floor
(In Mexico)
And then she did a dance I never saw before.

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in the Mexico
And you wanna get straight,
Man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe.

He wears a red bandana, plays a cool pianna
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash, and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

(Spoken by Carl Gardner:)
Yeah, como est usted senorita
Come with me to the border, south of the border, that is
In Mexico, yeah in Mexico
You can get your kicks in Mexico
Come with me baby, come with me, come with me, crazy, yeah"

169,The Everly Brothers,I Wonder If I Care As Much,TRRGIFH128F92EFC5C,1957,"I wonder if I care as much
As I did before...

Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day,
And wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if I'll suffer more

I wonder if I care as much
As I did before...

My pride is made to say forgive,
And take the blame for what you did,
It's your mistakes I'm thinkin' of,
I wonder if I'm still in love.
My heart can't thrive on misery,
My life it has no destiny,
When things get more
Than I can bear,
I ask myself ""Do I still care?""
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before.."

Goodbye to romance that might have been

Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Lead us lest too far we wander
Love's sweet voice is callin' yonder
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Hey, there don't get dimmer, dimmer
Light the path below, above
And lead us on to love

Glow little glow-worm, fly of fire
Glow like an incandescent wire
Glow for the female of the species
Turn on the AC and the DC
This night could use a little brightnin'
Light up you little ol' bug of lightnin'
When you gotta glow, you gotta glow
Glow little glow-worm, glow

Glow little glow-worm, glow and glimmer
Swim through the sea of night, little swimmer
Thou aeronautical boll weevil
Illuminate yon woods primeval
See how the shadows deep and darken
You and your chick should get to sparkin'
I got a gal that I love so
Glow little glow-worm, glow

Glow little glow-worm, turn the key on
You are equipped with tail-light neon
You've got a cute vest-pocket master
Which you can make both slow and faster
I don't know who you took a shine to
Or who you're out to make a sign to
I got a gal, that I love so

Glow little glow-worm, glow
