0,Sly & The Family Stone,Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),TRHWKVS128F4272924,1969,"Lookin' at the devil 
Grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin' 
I begin to run
Bullets start chasin' 
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle 
I was on the top

I want to thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin

Stiff all in the collar 
Fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin' 
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party 
But I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind 
Words in the way

I want to thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin

Dance to the music
All nite long
Everyday people

Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama start to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try

I want to thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
(Different strokes for different folks, yeah)
Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin

Flamin' eyes of people fear 
Burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much 
Hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Dig it for a starter, now
Dyin' young is hard to take
Sellin' out is harder

Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin
I want to thank you falettinme 
Be mice elf agin"
1,Humble Pie,Buttermilk Boy,TRNSRAO128F9301704,1969,"She pays no mind to methods you employ
She wants a big city man, not a country boy
Go get your long hair cut
Scrape the mud off your boots
Wash the hell behind those ears
Buy yourself some tailored suits

Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone
Makes no difference how you strive
She couldn't care if you're dead or alive
A burly, beefy, strong arm man
Is all she cares to meet

Before you ever heard the word guitar
Your mother used to see her as a star
Yes, she spent her teens
In chauffeured limousines
And I heard tell you can't get insured
For a clapped out '45 drop head Ford

Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone
She'll tear you down like a steer comin' through
Like I said she ain't no use to you
A lumpy hairy mundane brain
Is all she cares to make

So let me put you straight
Marry farm-yard Kate
She weights two hundred pounds it's said
But she'll keep you warm in bed

Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone
So you think you know where it's about
But she will suck you in and then she'll blow you out
Yes, Kate will keep you satisfied
Until your dying day
In chauffeured limousines

Yeah, let me hear some of that strong-arm music!"
2,Fairport Convention,Crazy Man Michael,TRVYHBE128F148EAFA,1969,"Within the fire and out upon the sea 
Crazy Man Michael was walking 
He met with a raven with eyes black as coals 
And shortly they were a-talking 
Your future, your future I would tell to you 
Your future you often have asked me 
Your true love will die by your own right hand 
And crazy man Michael will cursèd be 

Michael he ranted and Michael he raved 
And beat up the four winds with his fists-o 
He laughed and he cried, he shouted and he swore 
For his mad mind had trapped him with a kiss-o 
You speak with an evil, you speak with a hate 
You speak for the devil that haunts me 
For is she not the fairest in all the broad land 
Your sorcerer's words are to taunt me 

He took out his dagger of fire and of steel 
And struck down the raven through the heart-o 
The bird fluttered long and the sky it did spin 
And the cold earth did wonder and start-o 
O where is the raven that I struck down dead 
And here did lie on the ground-o 
I see that my true love with a wound so red 
Where her lover's heart it did pound-o 

Crazy Man Michael he wanders and calls 
And talks to the night and the day-o 
But his eyes they are sane and his speech it is plain 
And he longs to be far away-o 
Michael he whistles the simplest of tunes 
And asks the wild wolves their pardon 
For his true love is flown into every flower grown 
And he must be keeper of the garden"
3,Seals and Crofts,Sea of Consciousness,TRNTZOF128F92FC262,1969,"(lyrics and music by James Seals, 1969)

From the albums SEALS AND CROFTS (1969) and SEALS AND CROFTS I AND II (1974).

In the sea of consciousness I knew you, knew you, knew you.
In the sea of consciousness you loved me, loved me, loved me.
But this world is a dark world, with a black sun. Can I run to you?
And ah, just the thought of you makes me wander back
To the innocence you gave me, so long ago. Am I too late to go?

In the sea of consciousness you called me, called me, called me.
In the sea of consciousness I answered, answered, answered.
But this world is a dark world, with a black sun. Can I run to you?
And your perfection's perfectness have the mercy in
Which we all came to know you, so long ago. Am I too late to go?
Sea of Consciousness. Am I too late to go?"
4,The Idle Race,Sea Of Dreams,TRKYXNN128EF34E0F5,1969,"Little girl in the sea of dreams
There's a smile on her little face
She looked around she could see no peace
Her heart was sad and her body weak

Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum

But in her dream she was big and strong
She fell in love with a sailor

He travelled far off to distant lands
He never travelled to see her

Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum
Dum, dum, dooby-dum dum dum

Then one night a strange man did come
He whispered words unto her mother
Little girl in the sea of dreams
She closed her eyes and met her maker"
5,Lucio Battisti,Uno In Pi ,TRZZQWI128F42A0FE4,1969,"Una voce sta cantando
ma sono pochi ad ascoltare
i gabbiani stan gridando
per poterla soffocare
altre voci piano piano
stan crescendo da lontano
se quel canto vuoi seguire
puoi cantare

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

Lungo spiagge sconosciute
siamo in tanti a camminare
con le lacrime negli occhi
con il sole dentro al cuore
se sei stanco di lottare
vieni qui a riposare
se non sai più cosa fare
puoi cantare.

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

Mentre il mare sta a guardare
continuiamo a camminare
come tanti burattini
con le facce da bambini
se sei stanco di lottare
siedi qui a riposare
se non sai più cosa fare
puoi cantare.

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

E così
tu sarai
uno in più
con noi.

Ehh e così
tu sarai
uno in più
uno in più.

E così
tu sarai
tu sarai..."
6,Elvis Presley,I Can't Stop Loving You,TRXRSXC128F428B32A,1969,"I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart"

Like honey, darlin' girl 
I know you're sweet to me

Uh huh, 
Gonna say it again, now now now 
Hah! 
Like a ship that's driftin' baby 
You're apart from me 
Like old man time 
You controll my destiny 
If from my life, you ever tried to go 
It would destroy in a second 
What took a lifetime to mold 
That's why my love for you 
Just keeps on growin' 
More and more 
All the time 
More and more 
All the time 

Uh huhhhh 
Let me hear ya! 

As sure as a sunrise 
I'll stand by your side

For lovin' you too much woman,

8,Carpenters,Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing,TRSQUUZ128F14674E9,1969,"Sing, sing

Who's that stomping all over my face?
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?
And who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung?
And taking my gypsy before she's begun?

Just singing and a dreaming of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the times

Who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

Sing, sing

Who's all hung up on that happiness thing?
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?
And who's in the corner and down on the floor?
With pencil and paper just counting the score?

Who's trying to act like he's just in between?
The line isn't black if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be?

Who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

Sing, sing

Who's coming home on the old nine to five?
Who's got the feeling here to keep him alive?
Though having it, sharing it ain't quite the same
It ain't a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim

Who's seeing eyes through the cracks in the floor?
There it is, baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleeping but is writing this song?
Wishing and a-hoping he weren't so damned wrong?

Who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

Who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

Even sing, even sing"
9,JERRY WALLACE,There She Goes,TRPQYKJ128F92D277D,1969,"There she goes, she's walkin' away
Each step she takes brings heartaches my way
He's won her heart, I lost her some way
There she goes, she's walkin' away

If I hadn't cheated, if I hadn't lied
I'd be the one who's walkin' by her side

I love her still and I guess that it shows
She's walkin' away, there she goes

There she goes!
She's walkin' away.
Each step she takes… brings
Heartaches my way.

If I hadn't cheated, if I hadn't lied
I'd be the one who's walkin' by her side (by her side)

I love her still and I guess that it shows
She's walkin' away, there she goes

There she goes

I've been hoping, I've been tussling1
My baby come back home one day.

Well, that people,

One day people,
Just don't understand.
Well, now to take my woman away,
Can not try another man

I left town, you're traveling
while the train goes 'round the bend
Down at here and traveling,
while the train goes 'round the bend
Well, what've I started ain't no crime,
Me without all, have no friends

Welcome there new love,

Welcome there new love,

Well, I worked hard all of my life,
Now I'm getting pushed around"

I think that I am falling down
What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am upside down

Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work all right
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be all right

I'm going up and I'm going down
I'm gonna fly from side to side 
See the bells up in the sky
Somebody's cut their string in two

Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work all right
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be all right

One minute one, one minute two
One minute up and one minute down

You know it'll be all right"
12,Bobbie Gentry,I Wouldn't Be Surprised,TRVFVYF128F14A3A8B,1969,"If the ground were to freeze
Underneath my feet
In the summertime
I wouldn't be surprised

If the rain from the skies
Should put out my eyes
And make me blind
I wouldn't be surprised

'Cause nothing surprises me
Ever since you said to me good bye

You said forever and I believed
That's the way it would always be
Then she took you away from me
So suddenly

Now if the world was to end
Never again to turn for me
I wouldn't be surprised

And if she were to hurt you
I should do some crazy thing like
Take you back
I wouldn't be surprised

'Cause nothing surprises me
Ever since you said to me good bye

You said forever and I believed
That's the way it would always be
Then she took you away from me
So suddenly

Now if the world was to end
Never again to turn for me
I wouldn't be surprised

And if she were to hurt you
And I should do some crazy thing like
Take you back
I wouldn't be surprised

I'd hold you
And scold you
And tell you I told you"

I feel rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Hope you are quite prepared to die

It can never flourish 'til its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
'Til time has flown far from their dying day

Forgotten while you're here, remembered for a while

Life is but a memory, happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness for a long-forgotten show
Seems so easy just to let it go on by
'Til you stop and wonder why you never wondered why

Safe in the womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light
Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know what you are really worth

Forgotten while you're here, remembered for a while 
A much-updated rain from a much-updated style

Fame is but a fruit tree, so very unsound
It can never flourish 'til its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
'Til time has flown far from their dying day

Fruit tree, fruit tree
No one knows you but the rain and the air
Don't you worry
They'll stand and stare when you're gone
Fruit tree, fruit tree
Open your eyes to another year
They will know that you were here when you are gone"

Said you're gonna be a singer
Be a star and real swinger
I hope it's very nice

Went to her room and saw her things had gone

Where's her mind as she stands while I play 

She left behind names in the pages

Now she thinks that she maybe should tell them 
Of my book and the places she's been

Lo saludan la flautas del pajonal
Y voceando en las sendas por esos cerros
El arriero va, el arriero va . . .

Las penas y las vaquitas se van por la misma senda
Las penas y las vaquitas se van por la misma senda,
Las penas son de nosotros, las vaquitas son ajenas
Las penas son de nosotros, las vaquitas son ajenas.

Un degüello de soles muestra la tarde
Se apagaron las luces del pedregal
Y animando a la tropa dale que dale
El arriero va, el arriero va . . .

Y ojalá que la noche traiga recuerdos
Que hagan menos pesada la soledad
Como sombra en la sombra por esos cerros
El arriero va, el arriero va.

Las penas y las vaquitas se van por la misma senda
Las penas y las vaquitas se van por la misma senda,

And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining

Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me

I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!
Lovers break caresses for me,
Love enhanced when I've gone by.

You'll feel me coming,
A new vibration.
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed, they catch my glance,
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.

You'll feel me coming
A new vibration.
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...
Send your troubles dancing he knows the answer
I'm coming...
I'm a sensation.

I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerized by just the sight,
The few I touch now are disciples
Love as One, I Am the Light..."
52,Fairport Convention,Tam Lin,TRTLDQG128F427E126,1969,"I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
To travel to Carterhaugh for young Tam Lin is there

None that go by Carterhaugh but they leave him a pledge
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
When up then came young Tam Lin, says ""Lady, pull no more""

""And why come you to Carterhaugh without command from me?""
""I'll come and go,"" young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child""

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name""

For if my love were an earthly knight as he is an elfin grey
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

""Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""why came you here to dwell?""
""The Queen of Faeries caught me when from my horse I fell

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to Hell
I so fair and full of flesh and feared it be myself

But tonight is Hallowe'en and the faerie folk ride
Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must bide

First let past the horses black and then let past the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight""

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win

Then up spoke the Faerie Queen, an angry queen was she
Woe betide her ill-fard face, an ill death may she die

""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""what this night I did see
I'd have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree"""

That you'll love me again?

Now I cry tears that never become me

Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon
 
How I wish I could say
All the things I want to say
If some way, you could see what's in my heart
Oh, baby
 
I don't ask for much
A look, a smile, a touch
Try to forget
Lord knows, I'm trying
It's so hard to forget 
When your whole world you know is dying
 
Just one smile means forgiving
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon

Just one kiss, hurt's all gone

54,Kevin Ayers,Town Feeling (2003 Digital Remaster),TRGIJHK128E07946D8,1969,"Today, the town seems like a tomb
Everybody's locked up in his room
Making love, or taking love - who cares

If you take a walk out in the street
Chances are there's someone that you'll meet
If it's someone you know you'll say hello and good-bye

Today's the very first day of the Spring
A little girl's playing on her swing
She doesn't know that a brand new show begins

Now you come and tell me that you're sad
But you never talk about it when you're glad
You criticise, and you shut your eyes - that's too bad

With their dying leaves
Turning gold

You say it's just for a while, then you force a smile
And you hope she'll understand

As she tightly holds your hand
Then you let her know that it's time to go
You must leave while you can

Each one hurts your heart

You wipe your eyes so she can't see

I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired

You cry a little in the dark
Well, so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?

So I'll just write some love to you"
64,Strawbs,The Battle,TRMWUYA128F4257B4D,1969,"In the early dawn the Bishop's men
Shivered in the damp
But the shiver came not from the cold
And spread throughout the camp
 The trembling horses sensed the fear
 Of silent thoughtful men
 Who prayed that wives and families
 Might see them once again

The Bishops sent a dawn patrol
To investigate the weight
Of forces at the King's command
Ensconced behind the gate
 The ground mist hid the patrol's approach
 As they drew close enough to show
 The sentries on the battlements
 And an archer drew his bow

From the topmost tower a sentry fell
As an arrow pierced his skull
And his headlong flight into the moat
Seemed that of a gull
 The patrol reported little
 There was nothing much to see
 But the strong and silent castle
 A symbol of the free

The King's men took communion 
As the first rays of the sun
Lit up the chapel's gloomy walls
The fatal day begun
 From the castle green the rooks took flight
 To the high trees in the east
 To their carrion minds the battlefield
 Set a table for a feast

A tide of black, the Bishop's men
Equality their right
Swarmed like ants across the hill
Their aim at last in sight
 The King's men dressed in purest white
 Were driven back by force
 And the fighting grew more violent
 As the battle took its course

The Bishops gave the order
""No mercy to be shown
The sacrifice will reap rewards 
When the King is overthrown""
 The sight of children lying dead 
 Made hardened soldiers weep
 The outer walls began to fall
 They moved towards the keep

The rooks surveyed the battlefield
Their hungry beady eyes
Revelled in the sight of death
Showing no surprise
 The pressure mounted steadily 
 As the Bishops neared the gate
 And the desperate King called to his knights
 ""It's your lives or the state""

When the anxious King began to fail
As many thought he might
The Queen ran screaming round the walls
And urged the men to fight
 The Bishops' men were tiring
 As the afternoon grew late
 And the King's men lowered the drawbridge
 And poured out through the gate

They fought their way across the bridge
The men like falling leaves
Or ears of corn that fall in swathes
The vicious sickle cleaves
 The tide receded up the hill
 The waste of reclaimed land
 Once decaying swamp became
 A shore of pure white sand

A blinded priest was seen to bless 
Both dying and the dead
As he stumbled around the battlefield
His cassock running red
 If uniform were black or white
 His eyes could never see
 And death made no distinction
 Whatever man he be

As darkness fell both camps withdrew
Their soldiers slain like cattle
Leaving the rooks to feast alone
The victors of the battle
 At evensong the camps reviewed
 Their sad depleted ranks
 As survivors of the battle
 Gave God their grateful thanks"

It's all in the world I need
Lose of love
A misunderstanding of a no good woman
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed
All right
Every mornin'
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me
The birds sang the love song
My baby's caused my heart to bleed down
Every mornin', every mornin'"

a que sientas lo mismo que yo,
a que a la luna la mires del mismo color.
Esperare
que adivines mis versos de amor,
a que en mis brazos encuentres calor.

Esperare
a que yayas por donde yo voy,
a que tu alma me des como yo te la doy.

Esperare
a que aprendas de noche a sonar,
a que de pronto me quieras besar.

Esperare
que las manos me quieras tomar,
que en tu recuerdo me quieras por siempre
llevar que mi presencia sea el mundo que quieras sentir,
que un dia no puedas sin mi amor vivir.

Eperare
a que sientas nostalgia por mi,
a que me pidas que no me separe de ti.

Tal vez jamas seas tu de mi
mas yo mi amor esperare"

I'm walking on a lonely hard road
I haven't got much money - with some luck I'll hitch a lorry
Or keep carrying this heavy load

Thinking about her last night
I've been thinking it over, and she was right
Like a fool, I made her run away
But I'll walk this lonely hard road to find her someday

I'm walking on a lonely hard road
I'm walking on a lonely hard road
I haven't got much mony - with some luck I'll hitch a lorry
Or keep carrying this heavy load

'Though I've never said it before - when I find her again
I won't hurt her no more
So I'm gonna say it again - gonna find her someday
And she won't get away no more

I haven't got much money - with some luck I'll hitch a lorry

I'm gonna get my baby back - walking on this lonely hard road
So I'll just keep walking - on this lonely hard road"
75,Leonard Cohen,Lady Midnight,TRPDAHS12903CFAF0E,1969,"I came by myself to a very crowded place
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face
I found her there but she was past all concern
I asked her to hold me, I said: ""Lady, unfold me!""
But she scorned me and she told me
I was dead and I could never return

Well, I argued all night like so many have before
Saying: ""Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more!""
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor
She said: ""Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me
Just win me or lose me
It is this that the darkness is for.""

I cried: ""Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,
The stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold!""
""If we cry now,"" she said, ""it will just be ignored.""
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning
I could hear my lady calling:
""You've won me, you've won me, my lord
You've won me, you've won me, my lord
Yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord

Ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord
Ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord!"""

Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now 
And linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye...Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to her side
When a song of lonely love invites me on 
I must go to her side

Goodbye...Goodbye...

For the forest and further on
Painted wagons of the morning
Dusty roads where they have gone
Sometimes travelling through the darkness
Met the summer coming home
Fallen faces by the wayside
Looked as if they might have known

O the sun was in their eyes
And the desert that dries
In the country town
Where the laughter sounds

O the dancing and the singing
O the music when they played
O the fires that they started
O the girls with no regret
Sometimes they found it
Sometimes they kept it
Often lost it on the way
Fought each other to possess it
Sometimes died in sight of day"

We swore to each other then that our love would surely last.
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast,
Now I am too thin and your love is too vast.

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.

I choose the rooms that I live in with care,
The windows are small and the walls almost bare,
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer;
I listen all night for your step on the stair.

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me,
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free.
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory.

And I know from her eyes
And I know from her smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine

But how long can I go on living this way?

The people are the same in every land
Do they laugh because they have no way of crying?
Or cry because they have no way to laugh?

When he's looking in
Her eyes

I was born in the spring
Of this year
Warmed by the sun
And the winds that brought me here

On my face
And no footsteps
Leave my trace
They passed me buy in quiet talk

You'll have nothing left to show
The months slip by and change to years
Soon the twilight gloom appears
And then one day before you know
You'll have nothing left to show.

Where is this dream of your youth ?

The pictures on the walls are shaking
They can hear the storm a-breaking
Storms may come and storms may go
You'll have nothing left to show
Buildings all around are trembling
They can hear the earth a-rumbling
Buildings come and buildings go
You'll have nothing left to show.

Where is this dream of your youth ?

Tomorrow brings another dawn
It might be better from now on
Before too long that day will go

Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
Shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers

of an airplane as it flies
But I'd rather be deaf than
to hear you tell those lies

And I shouted and I screamed
till my face turned shades of blue
But I'd rather be dumb than

Hard to get by when what greets my eye takes my breath away

In my dream you are around the stars I watched your walls all fall away
You were bare of thoughts, we were to part and we stayed that way

Some try to hide because they lied, they were not true and they were afraid
They refuse to see or be free, be one with me and to gods, they prayed

Cryin', ""Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me
I'll save you, can I spend you?

And now this naked dream I had of you

Here's what I used to think about, think about: ( the ""bout"" in ""about"" is held for a while)

London Bridge is always fallin' down,
But there it stood within the heart of town,
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come...

The changes taking place are everywhere,

The centuries past have nothing to compare (""are"", prounounced as air, in ""compare"" is held for a while)
Where they stand, where they trip and fall
Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall

London Bridge is fallin' down at last,
And so another memory of the past
Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid

The thoughts will leave, will never die, 
and now so you can see (The ""ee"" in ""see"" is held for a long time)

London Bridge is finally fallin' down,
It packed it up and shipped it outta town
And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on

It used to stand within the heart of town
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come

London Bridge is finally fallin' down.....(fades)"

In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned

Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a-crawling, calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?"

Haven't been the perfect guy  
For a girl as sweet as you  
But my heart and soul cries out to you.  

One more chance that's all I need  
I'm gonna make it right, baby,

Is my only direction.

She'll speak your name to everyone she can

She's a devil in disguise

Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
She's just the kind that you can't do without

She's a devil in disguise

She's telling dirty lies

Whenever you are looking for a dime

The moon is full and you're just wasting time

We stood there lonely, baby, without you

'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl

I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call?

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler

I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby, and it hurts"

Un día gris
De primavera,
Bajaron hacia el sur
Con su juventud
En bandolera.

Con sus sueños al hombro
Cruzaron la colina,
Las viejas encinas
Los vieron marchar.

A cualquier parte,
En cualquier lugar,
Siguiendo otras pisadas,
El camino no acaba en el encinar.
Volvieron muy pocos de aquellos,
Mañana yo me iré con ellos
A buscar el mar.

Me voy, os digo adiós
Rincones en donde he crecido,
Os dejo en un cajón
La gris canción
De lo que he sido.

Me voy hacia otra tierra
En donde el sol caliente
Lejos de mi gente
Y del encinar"

As the knife quivered in his eye
I laid down my heavy head
The screaming wall began to cry
You lost your last hold on your flimsy mind
You know you've done it now
I turned my head and looked behind
At the blood welling from his brow

The harlot slowly crossed her legs
Vanished into a drowning child
Forty rows of angry spikes
Each one through a squiggling limb
The glass faces of the frigid mares
Dragged and sheltered in the wind
The cold draught brought the stench of pus
The boil bubbled on his flesh

The grey mist wafted in
Undulating, shrouded all
I was walking up the endless steps
Oozing purple from the cracks
Blazing Betelgeuse lit the way for me
Laser heat transmit my soul
The pressure force forced me on
To the long knife at the end

The wave rocked by brain
Crashing, smashing, all wrong
Lighthouse beam cross the black waste
Split the black till it was dawn
My mind returned to that stale room
That head took all his brain
Slowly, slowly it died away
Would I ever be the same?"

When the train come in the station 
I looked her in the eye 
Well, the train come in the station 
And I looked her in the eye 
Whoa, I felt so sad, so lonesome 
That I could not help but cry 

When the train left the station 
It had two lights on behind

I heard the captain cry
""Explore the ship, Replace the cook
Let no one leave alive""
Across the straits, around the horn
How far can sailors fly?
A twisted path, our tortured course
And no one left alive

We sailed for parts unknown to man
Where ships come home to die
No lofty peak nor fortress bold
Could match our captain's eye
Upon the seventh sea-sick day
We made our port of call
A sand so white and sea so blue
No mortal place, at all

We fired the guns and burned the mast
And rowed from ship to shore
The captain cried, we sailors wept
Our tears were tears of joy
Now many moons and many Junes
Have passed since we made land

Your witness in my own hand"

Perform their tricks while justice swings
From side to side
And may I remind you once again
Of the spectacle about to begin
Now forming at the darkest
End of the big top
Don't forget to take your place in line
Leave your mind behind
And join the precession of the people
By the people and for the people
Your own wonderful parade

Your wonderful parade
Moving through the towns that rise and then they fade
Over streets that pass the houses where you've stayed
Your wonderful parade

Your daily masquerade
Paper masks that hide the faces you have made
Crumbled down upon foundations you've laid
Your daily masquerade

Stand in line
Try to climb
Meet your wife at cocktail time
Sure to lose
So try and choose
A better way to fall

Your marvelous charade
Never could be worth the prices that you'vepaid
Blindness is a part of every game you played

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one"
126,Dusty Springfield,Just A Little Lovin',TROTOGK128F421CA81,1969,"Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
Beats a cup of coffee 
For starting off the day

Just a little lovin'
When the world is yawnin'
Makes you wake up feeling
Good things are coming your way

This old world
Wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had…

Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
That little extra somethin'
To kinda see them through

Nothing turns the day on
Really gets it dawnin'
Like a little bit of lovin'
From some lovin' someone like you

This old world
Wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had

Just a little lovin' 
Early in the mornin'
(Just a little lovin')

Oh, in the morning
Nothing turns the day on
Really gets it dawnin'

It's the one that you lied to when you said you'd be true

The scars on my face just deepen my mind


The love that you gave me has gone with the rain
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain"

In a hole up near a foundry
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a 'So long'
Long Spanish boots on a 'So long'

I took a day job in Bethlehem
I nearly threw in the towel then
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a  'So long'
High Spanish boots on a  'So long'
Dig it

I took a Spanish haberdashery
Restored with 15th Century tapestry
But oh, Mr. Nesbitt got the best of me
So I strapped on my boots and said : 'So long'
Laced up my high boots and  'So long'
Goodbye

I am on a job you see
'Cause my old boots they mean too much to me
Leather boots are just a mystery
Put on my boots and said : 'So long'

But a broken heart won't cure,
my endless search, little girl,
I gonna fix a magic(al) spell
to weave on you, little girl.
And for the long grass to catch you in
or for the orange to sweeten sin
before there's lemon on my table lain

I'd rather wait and die
a thousand times, little girl,
than take a woman into
the heart of my soul.
but if I catch you sleeping all unawares
I'd carry you off to my secret lair
where I'd bind your heart to my very soul.

I don't believe I've seen

When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead
And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead
Remember then, the summer birds with wings of fire flaying
Come to witness spring's new hope, born of leaves decaying
As new life will come from death, love will come at leisure
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen
Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream"

A few looks

mató a Don Guido, y están
las campanas todo el día
doblando por él: din, don!
murió don Guido, un señor
de mozo muy jaranero,
muy galán y algo torero;
de viejo gran rezador.

Dicen que tuvo un serrallo
este señor de Sevilla;
que era diestro
en manejar a caballo,
y un maestro
en refrescar manzanilla.

Cuando mermó su riqueza
era su monotonía
pensar que pensar debía
en asentar la cabeza
y asentóla
de una manera española,
que fue a casarse con una
doncella de gran fortuna.

Y repintar sus blasones
hablar de las tradiciones
de su casa,
a escándalos y amoríos


poner tasa,
sordina a sus desvaríos.
gran pagano
se hizo hermano
de una santa cofradía;
el jueves Santo salía,
llevando un cirio en la mano
--aquel trueno--
vestido de nazareno.

Hoy nos dice la campana
que han de llevarse mañana
a buen Don Guido muy serio
camino del cementerio.
Tu amor a los alamares
y a las sedas y a los oros
y a la sangre de los toros
y al humo de los altares.
Oh fin de una aristocracia!

La barba canosa y lacia
sobre el pecho;
metido en tosca saya
las yertas manos en cruz;
tan formal!

I can't show nor let go 
I feel that 
I feel that 
I feel that, now, I must be the Devil, baby 
Whoa, better not let me catch onto you 
Whoa, you better not let me, darling 
Aw-w-w, I'll drag you down into this old hole 
Mama don't want to see you down there, too 
Uh-uh, no she don't, now 

Well, I can't stop this evil feel 
Do you want to make a deal? 
I can't stop 
I can't stop 
I can't stop now; I must be the Devil, baby 
Whoa, don't make no deals with me 
Whoa, you don't want to make no deals, no you don't now 
I've got a long list of broken souls 
Well, it stretches far as your little eyes can see 
Uh-huh, yes it do now 

Well I can't bear to see my face 
Wrong's done I can't erase 
It's all wrong 
It's all wrong 
It's all wrong, now.  Oh God! I must be the Devil, baby

150,Spooky Tooth,That Was Only Yesterday,TRDULOH128E079325B,1969,"Guess I'll have to get out of this town
No sense in my waiting around
Only thing left for me here is pain
She's gone for sure now why pretend
Left last night with a friend
Leaving not a word that would explain

That was only yesterday
But will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow

That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow

I think I better find somewhere
A place where I won't care
I need some time to hide my shame
Was only just one day ago
Found what I'd been searching for
Had left town on a late night train

And that was only yesterday
But will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow

That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow?
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow

That was only yesterday
Will I ever face tomorrow? 
She took away what I'd had
And returned it full of sorrow"

I met a girl at school one day

Older Brothers:sandbox?!
We toasted our love during milk break
older Brothers:aw man

Marlon:Come on Mike!
We fell out during singin' plan
So one day, I stepped up to her and i said

152,Joni Mitchell,That Song About The Midway (LP Version),TRHGCZM128E078B05D,1969,"I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
You looked so grand wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly
I heard you can! Can you fly
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice

I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in
I heard you did! Pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win

So lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime

I've lost my fire overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired!
Slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down, down, down, down"

That you're from the other side
There's just one thing I got to know
Can you tell me please who won?

You must try some of my purple berries
I been eating them for six or seven weeks now
Haven't got sick once
Probably keep us both alive, yeah

Wooden ships on the water very free and easy
You know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free and easy

Sail away where the mornin' sun goes high
Sail away where the wind blows sweet, young birds fly
Take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this barren land

Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cry
Stare as all your human feelings die
We are leaving you don't need us

Go and take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this foreign land
Somewhere where we might laugh again
We are leaving you don't need us
No, you don't need us

Sailing ships on the water very free and easy
Easy you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free and gone

No, no, no

Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - those loveletters that you handed to me

I must have been a fool not to fall for you
When you were a schoolgirl

Those holidays when I showed you what I had
Remember when your mother caught us there
My father kept me in for being bad

When a phase couldn't begin to recognized
Roll on through my mind
Till I took the time to concentrate on you

You can teach me lots of lesson
You can bring me lot of gold
But you just can't live in Texas
If you don't have lot of soul

Leaving you now for the very last time
Leaving you now, really blown your mind
And where you're living now
You are finding how the other half lives

You can teach me lots of lessons
You can bring me lot of gold

Does he ever hold back comfort
When decisions can't be made
When you've lost the key to your thoughts
He won't look the other way

Places they can sit and hide
Till the troubles all blow over
And it's calm again outside

In your old way you're trying to find us
But we can't follow what's behind us
Too much blind faith, it will blind us
Though sometimes it's a blessing

But I remember when I still embraced you
A little prayer would ease my mind
'Til I saw that you hide from the misery outside so I left you behind
But all the other teachings 
That I've tried were 'bout the same
One grain of truth mixed with confusion caused by man
But since you're around anyway
May as well get you back on your feet again
Get right back up on your feet
Don't ya know we need somebody to
Do some work down in the street
You might just touch somebody
Start to think about today
Throw your robe and staff away
And break away from yesterday
Ah, tell me can we reach you
I don't know, still we got to go 
From here to there eventually

While others die up against the wall
You take the time to tell us all
'Bout how we're not supposed to ball

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!"

'Til I reached the age of ten

And left my dog Jeff, my only friend

Brought his life to a tragic end

From an orphan home to college
Thought I found true love in you
I felt sure we would marry
But your folks did not approve

Without any type of defense

That would make a little more sense

Everyday we kept in touch
But when we came face to face
You didn't love me quite as much

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard St. Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes, you do

But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes, it does

When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan, on your back and on your legs

And when the snow falls, you're found in St. Moritz
With the others of the jet set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no, you don't

But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you?
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realize where you came from
And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn

Where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

I remember the back streets of Naples
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly brown tags, they try

So look into my face, Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar deep inside, yes, you do

I know where you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
'Cause I can look inside your head

Lord knows to my surprise

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises

All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains"

191,The Flying Burrito Brothers,Hippie Boy,TRAWKKZ128E0793BD4,1969,"I was walking down the street the other day
and a sight came before my eyes
it was a little hippie boy, I must have been twice his size
his appearence typified his strange breed
gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my early trips to town
as he walked beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
he might have been on the weed or even LSD
but if he was I couldn't tell
so we walked together that way through this neighborhood
finally he turned around to me
and he said friend, you know we're a million miles apart
but you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
so why don't we put our differences aside
and just talk to each other
you see this box beneath my arm
to you it's plain, it has no charm
but to someone dearest to my heart this box has played a tragic part
this little one can't tell you himself about his life and how he died
but if anyone else could speak for him I guess I'm qualified
this boy was in Chicago, he didn't know why he was there
he was with his family and friends and he didn't really care
you might have been one of those
who saw the struggle there on your television screen
the tragic thing is so much else happened
that no one else could have seen
a stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore
to carry a package to a nearby hotel
and when he returned he'd get two more
but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking thru the crowd
one of them things you ask yourself, how the Lord allowed
but when he was found he was like he is now
dreaming sweet and still
and in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
now you can take that dollar
get four cents on it compound itquarterly at any downtown bank
so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
you kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
it's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street
just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
now could you help us sing this song, please
there will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that way"

We decided that we would have a soda

Felt forsaken
You'll awaken
To the joys of livin' hand in glove

And then I will
Lend you my will
And your days will be filled with love

Don't run the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches

Felt rejected
As expected
You rejected all the thoughts of words

So I'll pray with
You to stay with
Me forever and we'll make it work

The ice encrusted creek bank
A tender blade of new green grass
Is bravely pushing upward through the melting snow

The Spring breathes ruffles through my hair
And whispers softly everywhere
Telling secrets in my eyes
Search the countryside for your hello
The seasons come, the seasons go

Lightning darts among the pines
Caught in a summer rainstorm
Soaking wet I look upon the new plowed earth
With rivulets between each row

I almost feel you next to me
And it stirs a memory
That hangs suspended with a sigh
And gently weaves its way through my bedroom window
The seasons come, the seasons go

See the grain lay scattered
In a trail that leads to nowhere
The rustling leaves beneath my feet
Swirl in a colorful kaleidoscope

A thousand spans of outstretched wings
Circle briefly, hovering
And the swiftly fly away
Leaving me to stay and face December snow
The seasons come, the seasons go

Ice encases blades of grass
Encouraging the wind to pass
And in the frosty morning sun
A field of diamonds beckon, waving to and fro

I stare into the fire a while
Think of you, my love, and smile
Wishing you were here with me
Sharing the security I know
The seasons come, the seasons go"

Trees and grass and bushes green again
The sky so blue, I don't remember when
The cold days of winter took the sun away
But the springtime promises all came true
It's summer time now so please don't throw 't away

Winter will be with us once again
Flowers die'n everywhere again
And the warm days of summer will be far behind
And the springtime promises soon forgot

Grass and bushes withered, and the trees are bare
Dark and cloudy skies and people in despair
And the warm days of summer seem so far away
And the spring time promises still forgot
It's wintertime so you've got to wait awhile
For the springtime promises to come true

Now the new born year has come once more
Gentle showers awake us as before1
It's the time when all promises are now made true
And the springtime sun returns anew

Soon the earth will turn to green again
Flowers will burst forth soon to bloom again
The warm days of spring time tell us all is love
Can't you feel your promises will be true
It's spring time now
Be happy today"

Show him what you are you know you can do it
Don't let some other woman come along and beat you to it
Lots of girls might catch his eye but what is a girl when a woman falls by
To make a man feel like a man you gotta show him you're a woman

When he comes home from a hard day's work he's probably tired and dirty
Don't let him find this latchy queen have your castle lookin' pretty
There's lots of things that you shouldn't do like just as many that you should do too

Have you seen the tree in blossom
Shimmering in the setting sun
Would you point the way that I must go,
I've been searching since I realised it could be done
Still today there's nothing I can show

I'm gonna find the gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be

It's a thought away from here
It's infinity I hear
I'll find that gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be

Do you think that I'll be happy
When I find the leaves of gold
Will I feel there's nothing, more to do,
Will the rainbows end I followed
Fade just like a Marigold
I must find out for myself and you

I've gotta find the gold leaf tree
I'll live where the light goes free

It's a thought away from here

Only one so do I reach
Upon the bed of cool we sleep to live and die?
Estimating what we know
And what should be the goal between a laugh and cry?

And nowhere is there me...

As in worn out song it's far enough away
but thought was swallowed if has kissed
the single mind goodbye

Featured on the highest screen
Effigies of souls are seen to come and go
Moving through the mists of fear
Fortified with haze or cheer they come to know

But somewhere there is you...

As they wanna song it's far enough away
the thought was swallowed it has kissed
the single mind goodbye

at your feet the moving floor decides to burn
No appeal falls on the ear
suddenly the way is clear again you turn

Like sometimes I'm not really sure I even know
What's the difference being different
When it's difference now that looks alike

You say I'm changing, I'm not sure that's wrong
It's just the centerline on this highway runs up my guitar neck
And I feel somehow that it's natural to be gone
What crazy patterns do we follow
Sittin' knee to knee upon some riverbank

Somewhere at suppertime
The evening air is moving like molasses
Towards sticky night
So easy as I as I press your hand in mind

You seem a little colder
When I say I must be leaving
What an ugly way for us to let it end
What's the use in being worried

'Cause I'm goin' in an hour
When the time is running out that we could spend
What's the difference being different
When it's difference now that looks alike?

You say I'm changing, I'm not sure that's wrong
It's just the centerline on this highway runs up my guitar neck

That I can count on for an answer

I've dug too many holes expecting snow
I'm not sure to where I'm headed
How I'll ride and who I'm with
If I'll return or when I think that I might go

What's the difference being different

And finally blind me
The downy softness of herself forever lingering
Behind me
Never ever has there been 
Nor will ever be again
One someone to give you love, tenderness and be
Your friend
Hanging on 'till the bitter end
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost
But it's a heavy loss indeed for those in need.

I've tried to look inside myself
To find the strength from which to draw from
The view she saw from.
Since she tried to go too deep 
Limitations brought her down
And though I'd like to free her mind
Visitations bring a frown 
I gotta find the place she found
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost
But it's a heavy loss to bear when she's not there.
Where she is no one seems to know
The silken skies have swallowed her up or so it seems.

The morning mist that melts upon the meadow 
Brings a touch of sorrow 
The one I kissed is all alone
And may or may not know tomorrow. 
Just an ordinary girl
To the ordinary eye
But so much deeper goes the vein 
Like the glittering of gold you want to touch 
Then you gotta hold
You can't measure the cost of a woman lost."

The last time I saw her, she was waving me goodbye
She swore no other boy would take my place
I took a Mississippi Queen through New Orleans and down the Bayou
I hoped to find my destiny, my fortune and my face.

Please tell her that I said hello
Explain to her I didn't want to go
But a message from her daddy said : 'He's gonna see me dead'
And if I can get out now, she'll never know
She'll never know, never know.

I stayed around, I played around with all those Southern belles
But they took away my money and my pride
I had no place to go and the rest you know darn well
Living out the gutter ain't so easy to describe.

But I still had my guitar, so I joined a dirty band
Working in a smoky downtown bar
When comes along this big wheel with a contract in his hand
Said : 'Put your mark along here boy, I'm gonna make you a rock'n'roll star'.

Please tell her that I said hello
Explain to her I didn't want to go
But a message from her daddy said : 'He's gonna see me dead'
And if I can get out now, she'll never know
Never know, never know.

Well the years have come and gone and I was passing through to find
That my home town was still the same to see
Well, the memory I had of her had crumbled from my mind
I really didn't think she'd still be waiting here for me.

Please tell her that I said hello
Explain to her I didn't want to go
But a message from her daddy said : 'He's gonna see me dead'

208,John Denver,Rhymes And Reasons,TREQWYT128F42640EE,1969,"So you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter,
the fear that is within you now, it seems to never end.
The dreams that have escaped you, 
And the hopes that you've forgotten.
You tell me that you need me now,
you want to be my friend.
And you wonder where we're going,
where's the rhyme and where is the reason?
And if you cannot accept it is here we must begin,
to seek the wisdom of the children,
and the graceful way of flowers in the wind. 

For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
their laughter and their loveliness could clear a cloudy day.
Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow,
they're a promise of the future and a blessing for today.

Though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us,
the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea.
It is written: ""From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us, 
by the hand and by the heart, they will comfort you and me.
In their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free.""

For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
their laughter and their loveliness could clear a cloudy day.
And the song that I am singing is a prayer to nonbelievers:
""Come and stand beside us, we can find a better way."""

Can touch her loving now
The light of love has gone
Can I return the joy she's dreaming of
I don't know
I don't know

But if it don't work out
The tears that I cried, babe
(If it don't work out)
Won't bring her home
(If it don't work out)
If it don't work out

Will she still care for me
The way she did before, well
She turned around and tells me
She don't love me anymore
I don't know

But if it don't work out
The tears that I cried, babe

Won't bring her home
(If it don't work out)
If it don't work out

But if I could forget
The tears and the crying
That I went through
Once before
Maybe my love, could start
Start again

One day I know we'll find
The candle that we had
And I
Will know and feel
The joys and pleasures
That I'm dreaming of
And I don't know
I don't know

But if it don't work out
The tears that I cried, babe

""Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle
And you'll make all the coloured lights cascade.""

And music played in the penny arcade.
Yes, it played and it played, played all the time
""Roll up and spend your last dime!""

At first I thought it a dream that I was in.
Lost , lost in a sea of glass and tin.
But no, so dipping my hand in the back of my jeans,
I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machines.

When she walked out on me for the very last time

I don't know what I've done to be treated this way.

In a cold dirty room, that's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?
I don't know what I've done and I'm feeling so ashamed.

Then an angel appeared, she was just seventeen
In a dirty old town with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma, sweet mamma, can you tell me what to say ?

It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you’re never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

233,Bobbie Gentry,Fancy,TRUWCIM128F14A3A92,1969,"Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans.

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard-pressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress.

Well, Momma washed and combed and curled my hair,
Then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress.
It was split in the side clean up to my hips.

It was red, velvet-trimmed, and it fit me good
And starin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood.

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out girl it's up to you.
Now get on out, you better start sleepin' uptown.""

Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes when she started to speak

She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
""Your Pa's runned off, and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.""

She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-healed shoe

It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin', ""Momma what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy.
They'll be nice to you.""

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out, well it's up to you
Now get on out, girl, you better start movin' uptown.""

Well, that was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
'Cause the welfare people came and took the baby.
Momma died and I ain't been back.

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out.
It wasn't very long 'till I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout.

I knew what I had to do.
But I made myself this solemn vow:
That I was gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how.

I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame.
I mighta been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name.

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.

Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite.

Since then I've charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat.

Now I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites that would call me bad.
They criticize Momma for turning me out 
No matter how little we had.

And though I haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears.

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out well it's up to you.
Now get on out, you better move uptown.
And I guess she did"""

Who broke me in two

We've been so long apart

Of my sentimental friend over there

Bring the tears to her eyes
Help to make her realize
The love we had was just beyond compare
Then if the time is right
Maybe I'll hold her tight

When we heard a sad song
The teardrops would fall
And she'd hold me
And tell me
She'd be forever with me

Away back down the line you slipped and fell behind
And you never got back up, you never went on
But your head looked back at what you lost
If you could turn your head around it would help a lot

But there you sit with the blues on your mind
It keeps you stumblin' all the time
If only you could get together more often
Get together with yourself for real
Instead of just goofin'
So that everything you do you're into it all by yourself
But there you sit with the blues in your mind

Waitin' for somebody to say you're right
Tryin' to find somebody to take your life
You stepped outside and you were feelin' fine
There's new things you must do
But all those people make it hard to know who you are
And they're bound that they should say what you should do
And there you sit with the blues in your mind
That keeps you stumblin' all the time
If only you could get together more often
Get together with yourself for real
Instead of just goofin'
So that everything you do you're into it all by yourself
But there you sit with the blues in your mind

Waitin' for somebody to say you're right
Tryin' to find somebody to take your life"

He was laying somewhere else

The possum growled, Blue whined at him

Bye bye Blue
You good dog you
Bye bye Blue

When old Blue died he died so hard
He shook the ground in my back yard
We lowered him down with a golden chain
And every link we called his name

Bye bye Blue You good dog you

You good dog you

My old Blue he was a good old hound
You'd hear him hollering miles around
When I get to Heaven first thing I'll do
I'll grab my horn and call for Blue

Come and here we stand
And all the words have gone
Along with all the plans
And though the hands
Are surely moving on the clock
For us, this moment
Time itself has stopped

Our early-morning eyes 
Still feel a little sore
And bodies sweetly aching
From the night before
I can feel 
The cold platform through my shoes
There must be someting to be said
But what's the use?

The wind picks up some paper
Blows it past our feet
We watch it grateful
That our eyes don't have to meet
A screaming whistle rips the air
And takes away
The last seconds we have shared

And still photographs
The train begins its run
And suddenly all the words
I should have said had come
Someone touches me
And asks me for a light
And wonders if
I'm feeling quite alright
And I say yes...

On another platform there's a train
The same old scene is to be shot again
The wind picks up some paper
And with it I shall ride
Out through the door marked exit
Into the world ouside"

In the ghetto

'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see,
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks the rules
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies,
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries"

In their way, in their way

Think about stories, with reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people in their season and time
Returning again and again
And again, and again
But Saturday's sun has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat in the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by"
