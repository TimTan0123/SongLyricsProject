0,Marvin Gaye,How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),TRYLDWG128F92E249A,1966,"How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night,
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore,
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

(repeat and fade):
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you"
1,Simon & Garfunkel,The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine,TRSDFLV128F427703E,1966,"Do people have a tendency to dump on you?
Does your group have more cavities than theirs?
Do all the hippies seem to get the jump on you?
Do you sleep alone when other sleep in pairs?
Well, there's no need to complain, we'll eliminate your pain
We can neutralize your brain, you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine

Do figures of authority just shoot you down?
Is life within the business world a drag?
Did your boss just mention that you'd better shop around
To find yourself a more productive bag?
Are you worried and distressed, can't seem to get no rest
Put our product to the test. you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine

You better hurry up and order one
Our limited supply is very nearly gone

Do you nervously await the blows of cruel fate?
Do your checks bounce higher than a rubber ball?
Are you worried 'cause your girlfriend's just a little late?
Are you looking for a way to chuck it all?
We can end your daily strife at a reasonable price
You've seen it advertised in Life, you'll feel just fine now
Buy a big, bright green pleasure machine"
2,The Who,Substitute,TRSDBZV128E078E995,1966,"You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall, but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just backdated, yeah

Substitute your lies for fact
I see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all, you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall, but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just backdated, yeah

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye

3,Cat Stevens,I'm Gonna Get Me A Gun,TRQZUWX128F1463481,1966,"I've been demoralized too many times
But now I realize, ah, ah, no more

I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
'Cause I'm gonna get me a gun

I know my destiny is like the sun
You see the best of me when I have got my gun

I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
'Cause I'm gonna get me a gun

So you think you can push me around and make me run

Gonna get me a gun"
4,Stevie Wonder,Blowin' In The Wind,TRENWPP128F149633F,1966,"Mm, mm, mm
You know it's blowin' (blowin')
Blowin' (blowin')
And it's blowin' (yes it is now)
Whoa, blowin', mm, mm, mm

How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
And how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must those cannon balls be fired
Before they're forever banned?
Whoa, yeah, let me tell you that
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Whoa, yeah

(Well how many years)
Now how many years can a mountain exist
(Yeah before)
Before it's washed to the sea?
(And I wanna know how many)
Now how many years can a man exist
(Ah before)
Before he's allowed to be free?
(Too many years have gone by already now Stevie)
Now how many times can a man turn his head
(He turn his head and pretend)
And he pretends that he just doesn't see?
Whoa, yeah, you know the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Whoa, you know that the answer is blowin' in the wind

Uh huh, let me tell you it's blowin' (blowin')
Blowin' (blowin')

5,The Seeds,Mr. Farmer,TRSCZJC128F425F8A0,1966,"See the farmer on the other side of town
He's always working hard 'til the sun goes down
He's up every morning right on five, a wanting green seeds just to come alive
But he don't wear a no farm clothes, he's always using a rake and hoe
But his seeds are starting to grow, like a big stalk up through the sky

He used to live in an apartment in a big old city
With thick and priestly windows built right in it
But he decided to move to a little tiny town
He wanted to be a farmer all year round
And on a country road where you can't see a thing
He's got five acres filled little green things, he said
He's working so hard all night and day

Mr. Farmer let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer let me harvest your crops
I want to have a dream come true
I said a farmer, farmer, farmer
I want to be just like you

See the farmer a walking down town, always draws a crowd when he's around
He's always wearing seedy clothes, he's shows them off wherever he goes
You can spot him anywhere, got a bright pink thumb but he don't care
I said, he looks like something from a very bad dream

Mr. Farmer let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer let me harvest your crops
Mr. Farmer let me save your crops
I said, a farmer, farmer, farmer"
6,Simon & Garfunkel,A Most Peculiar Man,TRTKCKC128F427FFBC,1966,"He was a most peculiar man
That's what Mrs. Reardon says, and she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone within a house
Within a room, within himself
A most peculiar man

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man

He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room
And Mrs. Reardon says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon
And all the people said ""What a shame that he's dead
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?"""
7,Jefferson Airplane,Let's Get Together,TREPTSU128F4288A9F,1966,"Love is but a song we sing,
Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

If you hear the song I'm singing,
You will understand.
You hold the key to love and fear,
All in your trembling hand.
One key unlocks them both, you know,
It's at your command."
8,The Cyrkle,Red Rubber Ball,TRJTTNG128F4269122,1966,"I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only 
Starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining 
Like a red rubber ball

You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
Something for your pride
Always running, never caring
That's the life you live
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The morning sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

The story's in the past
With nothing to recall
I've got my life to live
And I don't need you at all
The rollercoaster ride we took 
Is nearly at an end
I bought my ticket with my tears
That's all I'm gonna spend

And I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

Oh, I think it's gonna be alright
Yeah, the worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball"
9,The Lovin' Spoonful,Rain On The Roof,TRBKUZK128F92F069C,1966,"You and me and rain on the roof,
Caught up in a summer shower,
Drying while it soaks the flowers.
Maybe we'll be caught for hours,
Waiting out the sun.
You and me, we're gabbing away
Dreamy conversation, sitting in the hay.
Honey, how long was I laughing in the rain with you?
Cause I didn't feel a drop til the thunder brought us to.
You and me underneath a roof of tin.
Pretty comfy feeling, how the rain ain't leaking in.
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour.
Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more.
You and me and rain on the roof,
Caught up in a summer shower.
Drying while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours,
Waiting out the sun."
10,Marianne Faithfull,Summer Nights,TRMQUXU128F1456259,1966,"Winter's almost gone,
Oh how I've waited so long
For summer nights.
When there's magic in the air
And I don't have a care,
All that matters to me
Is that you are here
On summer nights.

There's a little café
Where we can hear music play.
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go.
There you'll hold me tight and say
Our love will always be this way
On summer nights.

At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand
On summer nights.

In our little café
We'll dance the night away
And we know our love will be
Always true eternally.

And when the moon begins to shine
I can see that you are mine
On summer nights.

On summer nights.
On summer nights."
11,Bob Dylan,Just Like A Woman,TRVWARA128F4267290,1966,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
Yes, she does, she makes love just like a woman
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls

She takes just like a woman
Yes, she makes love just like a woman
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here, ain't it clear

That I just can't fit
Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Ah, you fake just like a woman
Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman
Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl"
12,Donovan,Ferris Wheel (2005 Digital Remaster) (Mono),TRYSDCW128E07897D5,1966,"Walking in the seashore twilight,
It's then you spy carnival lights,
You slowly near the magic sight,
Tangerine sky minus one kite.

Take time and tie your pretty hair
The gypsy driver doesn't care
If you catch your hair in the ferris wheel on top,
In the ferris wheel on top.

A silver bicycle you shall ride,
To bathe your mind in the quiet tide.
Far off as it seems your hair will mend
With a Samson's strength to begin again.

Take time and dry your pretty eyes,
Watch the seagull fly far-off skies
To build its nest in the ferris wheel on top,
In the ferris wheel on top.

If ever I reach her.

And the moral here, if any, my friend
Follow through your dream to the end.
Dig the seagull fly across the sky
To build its nest in the ferris wheel,
In the ferris wheel."
13,Violeta Parra,Cantores que reflexionan,TRUIDYR128F931CE7B,1966,"En la prisión de la ansiedad
medita un astro en alta voz
gime y se agita como león
como queriéndose escapar
¿de dónde viene su corcel
con ese brillo abrumador?
parece falso el arrebol
que se desprende de su ser
viene del reino de Satán
toda su sangre respondió
quemas el árbol del amor
dejas cenizas al pasar.

Va prisionero del placer
y siervo de la vanidad
busca la luz de la verdad
más la mentira está a sus pies
Gloria le tiende terca red
y le aprisiona el corazón
en los silencios de tu voz
que se va ahogando sin querer
la candileja artificial
te ha encandilado la razón
dale tu mano, amigo sol
en su tremenda oscuridad.

Qué es lo que canta digo yo
no lo consigue responder
vana es la abeja sin su miel
vana la voz sin segador
¿Es el dinero alguna luz
para los ojos que no ven?
treinta denarios y una cruz
responde el eco de Israel
¿de dónde viene tu mentir
y adónde empieza tu verdad?
parece broma tu mirar
llanto parece tu reír.

Y su conciencia dijo al fin
cántele al hombre en su dolor
en su miseria y su sudor
y en su motivo de existir.

Cuando del fondo de su ser
entendimiento así le habló
un vino nuevo le endulzó
las amarguras de su hiel
hoy es su canto un azadón
que le abre surcos al vivir
a la justicia en su raíz
y a los raudales de su voz
en su divina comprensión
luces brotaban del cantor."
14,Mississippi John Hurt,Make Me A Pallet on Your Floor,TRPXKFG128F92FF0C3,1966,"Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Oh make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Up the country
Up the country by the cold sleet and snow
I'm going up the country
By the cold sleet and slow
No telling how much further I may go
Oh make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Well sleeping, my back and shoulders tire
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tire
The way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Gonna turn over and try it on the side
Oh make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Don't you let my good girl catch you here
Please don't let my good girl catch you here
Oh she might shoot you
Might cut and starve you too
No telling what she might do
Oh make me down
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor"
15,The Mamas & The Papas,Straight Shooter,TRJSXPR128F147D6B3,1966,"Don't get me mad; don't tell no lie.
Don't make me sad; don't pass me by. 
Baby are you holding, holding anything but me? 
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter, if you know what I mean. 
You can bring me love; you can hang around. 
You can bring me up; don't you bring me down. 
Baby are you holding, holding anything but me? 
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter, if you know what I mean. 

I've been searching all night, just to find what I'm looking for.

16,Joe Dassin,Excuse Me Lady,TRLZEPR128F427F4D0,1966,"Tu as bien changé d'allure
Avec ton nez au ciel
Et tes yeux qui papillonnent
Ton p'tit chien qui frissonne
Tu ne me trompes pas
Va avec ton cinéma
Ta robe et tes chaussures
De la couleur de ta voiture

Excuse me lady, à d'autres mais pas à moi

Tu étais jeune et tendre
Il était bien trop riche
Vous deviez vous comprendre
Lui le loup et toi la biche
Pour un double coup de foudre
C'est vraiment très heureux
Et tu peux jeter de la poudre
Aux yeux de qui tu veux
Mais...

Excuse me lady, à d'autres mais pas à moi
Excuse me lady, à d'autres mais pas à moi

Te souviens-tu quand même
Quand on était bohèmes
C'était toujours la fête
On vivait d'amour et de café-crème
Toi, tu as pris ta route
Moi, j'ai suivi la mienne
Tu m'as bien manqué sans doute
Mais depuis tout à l'heure
Je n'en ai plus de peine

Excuse me lady, à d'autres mais pas à moi

À d'autres mais pas à moi
Oh non, à d'autres mais pas à moi, pas à moi
À d'autres mais pas à moi
À quelqu'un d'autre si tu veux..."

Mm, your every wish is my command
All you got to do is wiggle your little hand

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you

Just pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song

Make me do right or make me do wrong

18,Marvin Gaye,I'll Be Doggone,TRIRXJB128E07943D7,1966,"Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day (baby)
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay (baby)
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone, hmmm

Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

Hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone, hmmm

Now did you hear 
Well now, what I say ?
Oh, believe me 

Well, every woman should try
To be whatever has man wants her to be
And I don't want much
All I want from you is for you to be true to me

Well, I'd be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend (baby)
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)

20,Percy Sledge,When A Man Loves A Woman,TRXFBNU12903CCBE8A,1966,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I have
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want some other girl
Yes, when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, you're my world
When a man loves a woman"
21,The Elgins,Heaven Must Have Sent You,TRCZFRL128F931B32B,1966,"I've cried through many endless nights
While holding my pillow tight
Then you came into my lonely days
With your tender and your sweet ways

Now I don't know where you come from, baby
Don't know where you've been, my baby
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Into my arms

Now in the mornin' when I awake
There's a smile on my face
You've touched my heart with gladness
Wiped away all my sadness

So long I've needed love right near me
A soft voice to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, baby
Into my life

It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I want to stay

Want to thank you for the joy you brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close
When I needed you the most

Now I don't know much about you, baby
But I can't live without you, baby
Heaven must have sent you, baby
To love only me

It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I want to stay

Want to thank you for the joy you brought me
Thank you for the things you taught me
Thank you for holding me close
When I needed you the most

It's heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I want to stay"
22,Marvin Gaye,The Shadow Of Your Smile,TRIFSHP128F92F9DC9,1966,"You're so sweet and Warm,
Like the summer sun,
From far away my dear,
I can see your face so clear
Making me happy,
The world must understand,

The shadow of your smile,
When you, are gone,
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me (I Love You, I love you)

Our wistful little star
Was far, too high, oh my darling,
When a teardrop kissed your lips,
And so did I, yes lord

Now when I remember spring
All the joy, love can bring,
Oh girl,
I 'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
23,The Association,Along Comes Mary,TRJRXHD128F92F14E8,1966,"Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to give me kicks, and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations
No-one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks 
Whose sickness is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes
As who is most to blame today

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers
Will make them not the same

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch

And when the morning of the warning's passed, the gassed
And flaccid kids are flung across the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone 
The songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars

And then along comes Mary
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes reflect the lies, and make them
Realize their urgent cry for sight no more

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch"

Come peasant king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

In a great big old house full of butlers and maids

She says no one is better than I 
And I know I'm just an average guy 
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan

32,The Yardbirds,Ever Since The World Began,TRSDBWS128F931C4C6,1966,"(Chris Dreja / Jim McCarty / Jeff Beck / Keith Relf / Paul Samwell-Smith)
Ever since the world began,
Satan's followed every man.
Trapping evil if he can,
I tell you now his greatest plan.
Invented when I cannot tell,
Defied the thoughts of man so well.
Man wants money for his need,
But soon it sows its evil seed.
Unhappiness it only brings,
As man wants more and better things.
If not enough the evil lies,
But soon you'll find somebody dies.
Throughout the years there have been wars,
Power and richness have been the cause.
Trapped in money's evil net,
Man wants more than he can get.

You don't need money.
No, no, no, no,
You don't need money.
No, no, no, no,
You don't need money.
... etc.

It'll never bring you love,
No more than the sun above.
You'll never see the end,
The money you will surely spend.
But ask for help if you sin,
Reclaim yourself, what a state you're in.
The devil has you in his grasp,
There ain't no mercy you can ask.
More and more you will need,
You're strangled in the clutch of greed.
You can't get out, no place to go,
You sold your soul - the answer's no!"

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn

Passions will part to a warm melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen
Right in the middle of the town
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below
There could be one long staircase just going up
And one even longer coming down
And one more leading nowhere, just for show

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese
And ducks for the town to see and hear
Squawking just as noisily as they can
And each loud pa-pa-gee! pa-pa-gaack! pa-pa-gee! pa-pa-gaack!
Would land like a trumpet on the ear

With a proper double chin
Supervising meals to her heart's delight
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock
Oy, what a happy mood she's in!
Screaming at the servants day and night

The most important men in town will come to fawn on me
They will ask me to advise them like a Solomon the wise
""If you please, Reb Tevye? Pardon me, Reb Tevye?""
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes
And it won't make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong
When you're rich, they think you really know

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray
And maybe have a seat by the eastern wall
And I'd discuss the learned books with the learned men
Seven hours every day
That would be the sweetest thing of all, oy

If I were a rich man
All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum

Get it straight, I love the both of you.
Looks like rain, I do declare,
Your baby wants to take my chocolate eclair.

Away from me, away from me.

I give your baby a contact high
I love another is what I sigh
Someone's goin' through a cold turkey.
Girl ain't nothing but a willow tree.

Girl ain't nothing but a willow tree
Swaying in a summer breeze,
You'll never change what has to be,
Girl ain't nothing but a willow tree.

I couldn't cry, I could not laugh,
Incident about a silken scarf.
I know what a jealous trip can be.
Girl ain't nothing but a willow tree.
Girl ain't nothing but a willow tree..."
47,Donovan,Breezes Of Patchulie (2005 Digital Remaster) (Mono),TRVJROU128E07897DC,1966,"The long gone breezes are blowing down the sky.
From my window to the street I cast my weary eye.
Everything is quiet in the lonesome dusky night.
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.

I remember the days when the sun was warm with love
Softening as the day grew old in dazzling streaks of gold.
Now my days are meek, the sunset's the cruellest time
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.

I feel I want to ramble to the shores of the mighty sea
Pounding in my ears the wind so wild and free
To stumble in the high grass, the sand a-glowin' white
My eyes they feel, they break and spell the darkness of my night.

My sorrow is confusing, my love will never know
My empty hands they lie down by my sides so low
I walk this sleeping tunnel and the highway in-between bright
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.

Riding feathered wings to lick like I'm a dog
Oft I've heard the world as it cries out for some love
Cries out for someone, a little compassion and light
They're feeling so alone in the darkness of their night."

Of the note you sent this evening
To my door, you're not deceiving me

Sending round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now

Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place 

If at last I think I'm glad to rid myself of you I'm sad
To think about the time I'll have to go
Then I'll turn and walk away so please don't beg for me to stay
Cause I know just what I will say to you

Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place 

Tell me to my face you're leaving now

As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete

Are times that are few
And once I was happy
When I had you

But days have come and gone
Since you were here
Nights are twice as long
Without you near

Pictures on my mind
Stand out so clear
No matter where I am or what I do
My darling, all I see is you
 
You're there in every dream
I ever dream
There at every place
I've ever been

Everyday I find 
You're in my heart and on my mind
I close my eyes, but I'm not blind
I see you still

And when I throw my arms out wide
I find that you're not by my side
But one thing is for sure, until I do
All I see is you
 
Everyday I find 
You're in my heart and on my mind
I close my eyes, but I'm not blind
I see you still, oh
 
I won't live again
Till I'm with you
Oh darling, I won't love again
Unless it's with you

When you are back with me to stay
In every way
All I see is you"

Cantando coisas de amor

Despediu-se da dor
Pra ver a banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor

O homem sério que contava dinheiro parou
O faroleiro que contava vantagem parou
A namorada que contava as estrelas
Parou para ver, ouvir e dar passagem
A moça triste que vivia calada sorriu
A rosa triste que vivia fechada se abriu
E a meninada toda se assanhou
Pra ver a banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor

(Estava à toa na vida
O meu amor me chamou 
Pra ver a banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor
A minha gente sofrida
Despediu-se da dor
Pra ver a banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor)

O velho fraco se esqueceu do cansaço e pensou
Que ainda era moço pra sair no terraço e dançou
A moça feia debruçou na janela
Pensando que a banda tocava pra ela
A marcha alegre se espalhou na avenida e insistiu
A lua cheia que vivia escondida surgiu
Minha cidade toda se enfeitou
Pra ver a banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor

Mas para meu desencanto
O que era doce acabou
Tudo tomou seu lugar
Depois que a banda passou
E cada qual no seu canto
E em cada canto uma dor
Depois da banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor
Depois da banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor
Depois da banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor
Depois da banda passar
Cantando coisas de amor
Depois da banda . . ."

As the sun shines through the curtain lace 
And shadows wash the room 

And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with book markers
That measure what we've lost

Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
Can analysis be worthwhile?
Is the theater really dead?

And how the room has softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow
I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me

Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives"

73,The Incredible String Band,Footsteps Of The Heron (LP Version),TRLELDS128F1496A2D,1966,"One day as I sat in a big noisy crowd,
There was me and the whole of my conscience.
And I thought that I wouldn't be missed if I went,
and that my going would be of no importance.

And I've nothing to do,
And I've nowhere to go;
I'm not in the slightest way upset.
I'm not chasing a hope,
or a dream or a plan;
And I'm not even chasing the sunset.

The pussycat laughed and he followed me down,
As we walked through the crowds without motion;
He said he would stay, but he ran clear away,
I just laughed at his lack of devotion.

I met this fink, tried to buy me a drink,
And he says, I don't care 'bout no money.""
I said, ""Neither do I, but I'd buy you a guy,
If I thought you were trying to get funny.""

This man I did meet, spoke to me through his feet,
And he said, ""I don't care either 'bout no money.""
I said, ""Neither do I but I buy wings to fly,
'Cause without them the sun ain't so sunny."""

But for him it had just begun
And when i told him another boy had caught my eye

And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her

I didn't realize how young you were

Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew and I took your word

And then you told me later as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

You know the guitar came to Europe with the gypsies 700 years ago
Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us
It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I die just bury me deep
Down at the foot of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times do I crave
Place the tombstone at my head and my feet
Tell my friends that I've gone to sleep

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home

I ran to the terminal building, to fly by my airline
The man said I could ride the wing and I said that was fine
He said, ""I'll confirm your reservation, and put the plane on hold""
He come back and said, ""Sorry but that wing space just been sold""

I walked into the washroom and I built myself a fire
Threw on lots of paper and the flames kept gettin' higher
The janitor come runnin' in, so scared his face was white
So I explained my situation, he said, ""That's all right""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home

Next day I thought that I would leave, so I packed my things again
I waited 14 hours for a taxi to come in
Spotted one that wasn't full and I threw myself in fast

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock, I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried
I am a rock, I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one, and no one touches me
I am a rock, I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

85,Tex Ritter,Deck Of Cards,TRQHDLJ128F92FE0BB,1966,"Friends, this is Tex Ritter with a strange story about a soldier boy and
a deck of cards. During a North African campaign a bunch of soldier boys
Had been on a long hike, and they arrived in a little town called
Casino.""

The next morning being Sunday several of the boys went to church. A
Sargent commanded the boys in church, and after the Chaplain had read the
prayer the text was taken up next..Those of the boys who had a prayer book
Took them out, but this one boy only had a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out.

The Sergeant saw the cards and said,""Soldier, put away those cards.""

After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall.

The Marshall said, ""Sargent, why have you brought this man here?""

""For playing cards in church, sir.""

""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""

""Much, sir."" replied the soldier.

'The Marshall said, ""I hope so, for if not , I shall punish you more than
Any man was ever punished.""

The soldier said, ""Sir , I have been on a march for about six days, and I had neither Bible nor Prayer Book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.""

With that the boy started his story.

""You see, Sir, when I look at the Ace it reminds me that there is but one God. The deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts; the Old and New Testaments. And when I see the trey I think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When I see the four I think of the four evangelist who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. Ten of 'em; five who were wise and were saved; five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it
reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when
I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His
great work. When I see the eight I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife,their three sons, and their wives. And when I see the nine I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed , and nine of the ten didn't even thank Him. When I see the ten I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone. When I see the King it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the queen I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary who is Queen of Heaven. And the jacks, or knaves, it's the devil. And when I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find three hundred sixty-five the number of days in a year. Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. Four suits, the number of weeks in a month. Twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year. Thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serve me as a Bible, almanac, and prayer book.""

Before you make me cry

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
With a little kiss or two
Hold me tight with all your might
Before you make me blue

Make believe for one sweet moment
Things are still the same
Just the warmth of one carress
Will help to ease my pain

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
Darling, if you do, I pray
The feeling of my tender love
Will make you change your mind and stay

Just the warmth of one carress
Will help to ease my pain

Bring a little sunshine to my heart
Darling, if you do, I pray
The feeling of my tender love
Will make you change your mind and stay"

Come on boy, see about me

Ive given up my friends just for you

No peace shall I find
Until you come back

Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today"

That she cares, who lives there?

Catch my mind, turn my head, have to look, don't know why

Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to."

The Underground is closing soon
And in the dark, deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
Hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within his silent socket
He holds a coloured crayon

Now, from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide in welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently 
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now, from his pocket quickly flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of
Four letters

And his heart is laughin', screamin', poundin'
The poem across the tracks reboundin'
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night"

It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along, he knows he's wrong
To be so hard on a woman that's trying
 
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that
 
Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
 
I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Then it surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart
 
So before I go, a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now
 
Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is
 
We've been loving so long
It just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby, I wouldn't care
If I thought that you're needed me
 
All the chains in the world
(Couldn't hold me, couldn't hold me)
Like a robot your love
(Controls me, controls me)

Tu non hai niente

No non sa.

Che sei felice con le tue canzoni
Che non nascondi al buio le parole

While the one who love me
She was sitting at home

I was a fool
Paying the bills
Everybody makes a mistake sometimes

But when I got home, oh
My baby, she was gone
And I found a letter
Right there on the kitchen floor, it read:

""I tried to wait for you to come, honey
But like a fool...""
I'm sorry
Everybody makes a mistake sometimes

""So if you are running around with somebody else
Try to satisfy, man you can't satisfy your selfish self
Man, you gotta take heed
'Cause that same thing might happen to you someday

I walk the night without a goal 
Stripped of my heart, my soul

Here come the stars tumbling around me 
There's the sky where the sea should be 

What now, my love, now that you've gone

Memories that flow
Bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

To show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing
If I'm coming or going
But I

I love you

Miss having you around
Makes these tears inside
Start falling down

Always with half a kiss
You remind of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feeling
Cause my head starts spinning
Cause I

I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you

Yes, I do
Yes, I

Ooh, I try hard to hide
My hurt inside
This old heart of mine
Always leaves me crying

The way you're treating me
Leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day
Gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it

Who met she as she journeyed forth?
St. Peter that good man,
Who sadly did her scan

O tell me have you seen Him yet
The one I love ?
God's son whom I have lost
The Son whom I have lost.

To well, to well I have seen that Son, 
T'was by a palace gate
Most grievous was His state,
Most grievous was His state.

O say, what wore He on His head?
A crown of thorns He wore;
A cross He also bore, 
A cross He also bore.

Through all the land would run
That she might find her Son 
That she might find her Son."

She always takes a candy stick to bed
Don't stand close to the candy man

Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is
There warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground

In places small faces unbound

Round the squares
Huddled in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes
And black limousines
Some living, some standing alone"

The retired writer in the sun.
Tonight I trod in the starlight, I excused myself with a grin.
I ponder the moon in a silver spoon and the little one 'live within.
And here I sit, the retired writer in the sun,
The retired writer in the sun.
The magazine girl poses on my glossy paper aeroplane
Too many years I spent in the City playing with Mr. Loss and Gain.
And here I sit, the retired writer in the sun,
The retired writer in the sun and I'm blue,
The retired writer in the sun.
I bathe in the sun of the morning, lemon circles swim in the tea
Fishing for time with a wishing line and throwing it back in the sea.

When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises

I don't think you want me to see you ever again
And today, I saw you dressed as a flower bed
Last week, you had a wig on your head
Directing traffic in the street
And your shoes were too big for your feet
You were wearing disguises

Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

So soft, so warm

They said he was much to wild for me
They said I didn't know what I was getting myself into
They said a whole lot of things
But there are some things they could never understand
That a girl can tell by the way a boy holds her hand
Or maybe they thought we were too young to be in love this way

This girl's love is getting stronger with each passing day

When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar."

You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree

As if the mayor had offered me the key

to Paris

The pigeons feeding in the square have flown

And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound

Forget you the next day

You're not the girl that I belong to
And even though I know it's wrong to
There's a little place where we can go
Where we won't run into a soul we know

Whoa, baby, baby
Well I wish I could get you out of my heart
Then I could also get you out of my life
Baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you

Sure I could tell you it's over and then
One day I'd call you and beg you to see me again
This is a fine mess I got myself in
And let me tell you baby, you're not helping 
You know the changes I'm going through
And still you look at me the way you do

Cause you got me to fall in love with you
Though I'm not free to fall in love with you
Baby, baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
I want to know
Why did I have to get so hung on you"

Deciding on where to go

""Meet me under the whale
In the Natural History Museum""

A little bit sad about having to leave them

Yawning in the sun
Like a child I run

But don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
But don't it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that

How little do you speak of beauty
Isn't it a shame, what ho
Maybe you should go get a power ring
You'd make all your troubles go

There she stood in drag
Just-a lookin' cool in astrakhan
She's lookin' a little wiped out
She said I looked like Peter Pan

Yawning in the sun, oh baby

I'd still have a broken heart
If it hadn't been for you
If it hadn't been for you
 
You put your sweet lips on mine
And I believed in love again
The world took on a new shine
And, oh how sad it was then
 
When love was so cruel to me
How empty my life would be
If it hadn't been for you

Christmas Eve in my home town

Laughter everywhere,
Couples kissing under the mistletoe

I can't help reminiscing
Knowing I'll be missing
Christmas Eve in my home town

Nothing can erase the mem'ries I embrace
Those familiar footprints upon the snow

There's so much to remember
No wonder I remember
Christmas Eve in my home town

I'd like to be there
Trimming the tree there
And there's a chance that I might

I can hear singing
Steeple bells ringing
Noel and Silent Night

Wise men journeyed far, guided by a star
But though I'm not a wise man, this I know

Through dreams and just pretending
I'm there and I'll be spen-ding

One silent kiss leaves you in a trance.
And now you know you cannot live alone, 
How you know your future is unknown.
One day the questions rise. 
On wings of chance you fly. 

And on that day your laughs and tears will die,
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies.
And you will love when love comes your way.

Like she stepped out off of a Fellini film,
She sat in a white straw chair
But I thought I'd take a second look
Just to see what I could see
And my scene had popped out like a bubble does,
There was nobody there but me.

When your trippin' ship touches sand.""

Held in a bejewelled glove
And her knights they toast the tournament,
The falcons they fly above.
And the queen will a drink of the dew tonight
But the jester she cries alone,
Because Merlin he spoke of an instant spell
To make the devil's white knights moan
And-a all in all, the seagull said,
""As I look to where I've been,
The whole wide human race
Has a-taken far too much Methedrine"".

With sparkles everywhere,
And Julian he sat on a diamond ring
And-a talked of the days gone by.
We spoke of a common kaleidoscope
And the pros and the cons of Zen
And he spoke and-a said for a piece of cake
He really did have a yen.
Bobby Dylan he sat ""the Mad Hatter"",
A broken hour glass in his hand,
And-a Joannie sat in a white lace
Looking cool with a black lace fan.

Like a memory it falls 
Soft and warm, continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And the song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so, you see, I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There, but for the grace of you, go I"

But peanuts and pigeons and people put me in a hole.
A blessing refreshing in you did unfold, 
Dispelling depressing distressing thoughts from my soul.

And I hide behind the shield of my illusion

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

The mirror on my wall cast an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I'm blinded by the light of God, and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall

It's no matter if you're born to play the king or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy becomes reality
And I must be, what I must be, and face tomorrow

Only need to see the sun,
I will not go and cause harm,
I cannot think that way.

Sit spellbound by a flickering screen,
Watch the ever changing scenes,
Listen to the rising screams,
Of children of today.
Lock your doors and stay within,
Upon your face the stupid grins,
Penalty for unrealised sins,
Committed on your way.

And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do now
Cause you leave me alone to cry on my own
I swear you got a heart that's made of stone
Made of stone
And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do
But I do now
I cry, you know why I would die if you left me again
The tears and the years would have all surely been in vain, now
But you keep on leavin' me alone
To cry on my own 
I swear you got a heart that's made of stone
Made of stone
And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do
You say you tell me no lies, yea
Then why, why do I cry, yea

Mä olen herra Virtanen ja pikku-virkamies.

En pettää voi, asemani vaatii sen.
Ja verotaakan kannan aina vaieten.
On luottamus tehdä työtä valtion.

Mä olen herra Virtanen ja pikku virkamies.

Murheen hautaa vastuu töitteni,
On surut valtion kuin omani,
En tiedä kuinka käytän lomani.

219,Cher,Elusive Butterfly,TRABMXO128F145AFE1,1966,"You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving
Pass your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'd met the fleeting glimpse
Of someone's fading shadows

Out on a new horizon
You may see the boat in motion
Of a distant carib wind
And if you need press your ear
You might hear footsteps running
Through an open meadow

Do be so concern it will not harm you
It's only mistress doing something
I'm not sure of
Cross my dreams with myths and wonders
I'll take the brightest elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps echo softly
Through the distant, from canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran safely after something to believe in

You might have see me running
Through the long abandon ruins
Of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something
They're the brightest path to follow close
I remember dreaming

Do be so concern it will not harm you
It's only mistress doing something
I'm not sure of
Cross my dreams with myths and wonders
I'll take the brightest elusive butterfly of love"
220,Phil Ochs,Bracero,TRKPKWB128F92FD983,1966,"Wade into the river, through the rippling shallow watter
Steal across the thirsty border, bracero
Come bring your hungry bodies to the golden fields of plenty
From a peso to a penny, bracero
Oh, Welcome to California
Where the friendly farmer will take care of you

Come labor for your mother, your father and your brother
For your sister and your lover, bracero
Come pick the fruit of yellow, break the flower from the berry
Purple grapes will fill your belly, bracero
Oh, Welcome to California
Where the friendly farmer will take care of you

And the sun will bite your body, as the dust will draw you thristy
While your muscles beg for mercy, bracero
In the shade of your sombrero, drop your sweat upon the soil
Like the fruit your youth can spoil, bracero
Oh, Welcome to California
Where the friendly farmer will take care of you

When the weary night embraces, sleep in shacks that could be cages
They will take it from your wages, bracero
Come sing about tomorrow with a jingle of the dollar
And forget your crooked collar, bracero
Oh, Welcome to California
Where the friendly farmer will take care of you

And the local men are lazy, and they make too much of trouble
Besides we'd have to pay the double, bracero
But if you feel you're fallin', if you find the pace is killing
There are others who are willing, bracero
Oh, Welcome to California
Where the friendly farmer will take care of you"
221,Chris Clark,Love's Gone Bad,TRYSDCD128F1471718,1966,"Ah, I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my vein
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's so sad 'cause love's gone bad

I see a rainbow going black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night, callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane

I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's feeling sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad

Black crows flying up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Slime's on the land, slime's on the sea
Slime's not the last thing I'm destined to be

In this whole world where there's nothing right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart's feeling sad, love's gone bad

Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad"

But still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you makes it hard to live
Without, somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give
Never think of myself

If I gave you time to change my mind 
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced
While I cried

But still I'd look to find a reason to believe

From the one I used to know
For when you hold me now
I feel like you never want to let me go

It's a sign of the times
That you call me up whenever you feel lonely
It's a sign of the times
That you tell your friends that I'm your one and only

I'll never understand 
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand 
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

Mm mm mm

I'll never understand
The way you treated me
But when I hold your hand
I know you couldn't be the way you used to be

Maybe my lucky star
At last decided to shine
Maybe somebody knows
How long I've waited to make you mine

It's a sign of the times
That you kiss me now as if you really mean it

And take your love away
Just leave the past behind

Suddenly the past has fallen in behind us
Now all I know is I want you to stay

Don't slip away, oh no, don't slip away
Now that you're here we should just let it happen

Some things are best if they're only forgotten
You know I'm sorry, but what can I say?
The best years are after tomorrow
But time for changing should begin with today.

Don't slip away, oh no, don't slip away
Now that you're here we should just let it happen

You can't hide what we shared with each other
I know you still care and feel the same way
I'm sure there's more love in your heart than you're showing
Now it depends on what you have to say.

The changes I'm going through ?
A hidden lie would fortify
Something that don't exist
But it ain't so bad, I'm just a lad,
So many more things to do,
I intend to come right through them all with you.

My songs are merely dreams visiting my mind
We talk a while by a crooked stile,
You're lucky to catch a few.
There's no magic wand in a perfumed hand,
It's a pleasure to be true.
In my crystal halls a feather falls
Being beautiful just for you
But that might not be quite true, that's up to you.

Dawn crept in unseen to find me still awake
A strange young girl sang her songs for me
And left 'fore the day was born.
That dark princess with saddening jest
She lowered her eyes of woe,
And I felt her sigh, I wouldn't like to try
The changes she's going through
But I hope love comes right through them all with you."

And treated like dirt

And when my man finally comes home
He makes me glad it happened that way

Beyond the dawn and burning
In the heart of Soho

Hear the market cries
And see their wares displayed
Through the window of your soul

Come watch the naked dance
That spins before your very eyes
Naked like the sun

Step inside where men before
Have drunk to fill to senseless
Till the dreams fade and die

And free and easy
Does the blood red wine come flowing
From the glass to your veins

And the midday dream is silent
Thou gardens where you're resting
From the troubles of your mind

And though the sun is burning brightly
All within the gardens
Are the sleeping oris dead

And through the afternoon
The buzzing bees do harmonise
Through the rushing sale daylight"

Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around?
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown

Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties"
