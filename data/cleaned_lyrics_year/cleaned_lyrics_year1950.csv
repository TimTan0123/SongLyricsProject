0,"Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup",My Baby Left Me,TRMBROF12903CD4B70,1950,"Yes my baby left me,
Never said a word.
Was it something I done,
Something that she heard?
My baby left me,
My baby left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.

Now I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and cry.
I hate to lose that woman,
Hate to say goodbye.
You know she left me,
Yes, she left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.

Baby, one of these mornings,
Lord, it won't be long,
You'll look for me and,
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone.
You know you left me,
You know you left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word.

Now, I stand at my window,
Wring my hands and moan.
All I know is that
The one I love is gone.
My baby left me,
You know she left me.
My baby even left me,
Never said a word."
1,Frank Sinatra,Lover,TRNOAFK128F935DD17,1950,"Writer(s): Rodgers/Hart 


Lover, when I'm near you, and I hear you - speak my name
Softly, in my ear you - breathe a flame

Lover, it's immoral, but why quarrel - with our bliss
When, two lips of coral - want to kiss

I say (that) the devil is in you, and to resists you - I try
But if you didn't continue - I would die

Lover, please be tender, when you're tender - fears depart
Lover, I surrender - to my heart"
2,Frank Sinatra,It All Depends On You,TRPJOJG128F933E669,1950,"Writer(s): Desylva/Brown/Henderson 

Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine, and the morning dew
Each thing depends on something, and I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money, or spend it
Go roght on living, or end it
You're to blama, baby, for what I do
I know that I can be beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know, dear, you can help me on?
Wouldn't it hurt, to know, dear, all my hopes were gone?
Wouldn't it make you proud, dear, if I made a name?
But if I failed to win, dear, would you want all the blame?"
3,Gene Autry,Frosty the Snowman,TRCCBDS12903CC9649,1950,"Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
May the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when before their eyes
He came to life that day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

For Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again someday

Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety, thump, thump
Thumpety, thump, thump
Over the hills of snow"
4,Hank Snow,I'm Moving On,TRJPCXS128F92F8129,1950,"That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free 
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let this rattle a roll
And keep movin' me on

Mister engineer take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
You're gonna ease my mind put me there on time
And keep rollin' on

I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on I'll soon be gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You switched your engine now I ain't got time
For a trifling woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on you stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on"
5,Hank Thompson,Humpty Dumpty Heart,TRBPTJZ12903CE025F,1950,"Humpty dumpty set on the wall humpty dumpty had a big fall
All the king's horses all the king's men could never put humpty together again

I've got a humpty dumpty heart you dropped it and broke it apart
All the king's horses all the king's men could never put humpty together again
Cause when I gave to you my heart you said that we must part
That was my doom my heart went boom I got a humpty dumpty heart
[ fiddle ]
My heart is a fragile thing when dropped it won't bounce or ring
It ain't no joke cause when it's broke no love song will it sing
I've got a humpty dumpty heart...

I didn't think you were that sort when I handed you my heart
You got it on a platter but you let it shatter my humpty dumpty heart
I've got a humpty dumpty heart..."
6,Hank Thompson,She's A Girl Without Any Sweetheart,TRZSQOY128F426A422,1950,"She's a girl without any sweetheart and each night she sits there alone
This whole world she'd give for a new start but the chances she had now are gone
She used to have boys by the dozens but each one she left sad and blue
Now she's a girl without any sweetheart and it's all cause she couldn't be true
[ steel - fiddle ]
Each line in her face tells a story of each other heart that she broke
It's too late now to say that she's sorry for each unkind word that she spoke
The flower of you finally faded her old love she cannot renew
Now she's a girl without any sweetheart and it's all cause she couldn't be true"
7,Jimmy Rogers,That's All Right,TRPFDYD128F92DCD43,1950,"You told me baby, once upon a time
You said if I would be yours, you would sure be mine
That's alright
I know you don't love me no more baby, but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight

You told me baby, your love for me was strong
When I woke up little girl, half of this big world was gone
That's alright
I guess I'll never be the same but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight

(spoken: Play the blues for me Freddie King!)

Please tell me baby, what's getting wrong with you?
You don't treat me halfway right baby, look a like you used to do
But that's alright
I guess I'll never be the same but that's alright
Every night and day I wonder who is loving you tonight"
8,John Lee Hooker,House Rent Boogie,TRGHIFW12903CC7AC1,1950,"Spoken: Hey, It's the house rent boogie

I come home last Friday, talk to the woman that I lost my job
She says don't confront me an' so I have my rent next Friday
An' next Friday come, I didn't have the rent an' out the door I went
Yes, yes

Hmm, hmm
Yes, yes

Come here now y'all, right 'cross the street here
Help me get this rent together
Some give me a nickel and some give me a dime

I'm tired of keepin' this movin' every night
I can't hold out much longer
Now I got this rent, now let's get together, y'all
Let's have a ball

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
9,John Lee Hooker,Wandering Blues,TRHMNPK128F92F9809,1950,"Every night I wander all by myself
Every night I wander all by myself
Thinkin' about the woman I love, lovin' someone else

Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'
Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'
I'm worried about my baby, she's on my mind

Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?
Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?
And again I wonder, if I will ever be free

I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind
I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind
I never love one woman, no more at a time

Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry
Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry
I'm thinking about the lovin', that I let go by

Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good
Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good
Because I never get the loving, that I really should"
10,Muddy Waters,Rollin' Stone,TRGXCDK128E078FA73,1950,"Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin in a oh, deep, blue sea
I would have all you good lookin women
Fishin, fishin after me
Sure 'nough, a-after me
Sure 'nough, a-after me
Oh 'nough, oh 'nough, sure 'nough

I went to my baby's house
And I sit down oh, on her steps
She said, ""Now, come on in now, Muddy
You know, my husband just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left
Sure 'nough, he just now left""
Sure 'nough, oh well, oh well

Well, my mother told my father
Just before hmmm, I was born
""I got a boy child's comin
He's gonna be, he's gonna be a rollin stone
Sure 'nough, he's a rollin stone
Sure 'nough, he's a rollin stone""
Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a

Well, I feel, yes I feel
Feel that a low down time ain't long

Back, back down the road I'm goin
Back down the road I'm goin
Back down the road I'm goin
Sure 'nough back, sure 'nough back"
11,Muddy Waters,Louisiana Blues,TRISSOB128F932C896,1950,"I'm goin' down in Louisiana

My trouble just begun"
12,Percy Mayfield,Please Send Me Someone to Love,TRMBVKJ12903CB65B7,1950,"Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But, if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love.

Show all the world how to get along,
Peace will enter when hate is gone.
But, if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

I lay awake night and ponder world troubles.
My answer is always the same.
That unless men put an end to all of this,
Hate will put the world in a flame, (oh) what a shame.
Just because I'm in misery.
I'm not begging for no sympathy.
But if it's not asking too much,
Just send me someone to love.

Heaven please send to all mankind,
Understanding and peace of mind.
But if it's not asking too much,
Please send me someone to love.

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do
Because strange things are happenin'
Babe, an' somethin' might happen to you

If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?
Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery

Hey!

Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too
You better change your ways pretty baby
Or somethin' might happen to you"
13,Percy Mayfield,Strange Things Happening,TRRHPHM128F4278149,1950,"Learn to love me or leave me
Either one you wanna do
Learn to love me or leave me

14,Piano Red,Rockin' With Red,TRPCPTQ128F428756F,1950,"I'm goin' downtown
Get me a rockin' chair
Gon' let my baby rock me
On away from here

She knows how to rock me
Lord, she sure can rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean

Now, she can rock me up
Rock me, down
Rock me, cross
Lord, she rocks me 'round

She knows how to rock me
She sure can rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean

Now, she rocks me in
Rocks me out
She knows what it's all about

She sure can rock me
Ooh, rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean

'Rock with me, now'

She rocks me to the right
Rocks me to the left
Sometime, I b'lieve
She gon' rock me to death

If I don't give her my money

But she sho' can rock me
Knows how to rock me
Now, if you ever been rocked
You'll know just what I mean."
15,The Weavers,The Roving Kind,TRROXJS128F934266A,1950,"(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)

As I cruised out one evening upon a night's career
I spied a lofty clipper ship and to her I did steer
I heisted out my signals which she so quickly knew
And when she saw my bunting fly she immediately hove to-woo-woo

(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)

I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine
And hardly did I realize she was the rovin' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips and found to my surprise
She was nothin' but a pirate ship rigged up in a dis-guy-eye-ise

(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-eye-eye)
And her hair hung down in ring-a-lets
(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind)

So, come all ye good sailor men who sail the wintry sea
And come, all ye apprentice lads, a warnin' take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships, they'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas there she made me walk the plank and pushed me under, too-ooh-ooh

(She had a dark and a-rovin' eye-uh-eye and her hair hung down in ring-a-lets)
She was a nice girl, a proper girl but one of the rovin' kind

(She was a nice girl, a proper girl but)
One of the rovin' kind (yo-ho!)"
