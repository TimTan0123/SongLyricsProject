0,Bobby Darin,Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me (LP Version),TRCOTCL128F1477D03,1964,"Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why have people tear the seam of anyone's dreams?
Is way over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Atleast consider our romance
If you should take the word of [Incomprehensible] you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss me, cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
Please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you know you never will

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss me, cloud my memory
And other arms may give me a thrill
Don't do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will"
1,Buddy Holly,You're The One,TREOCCH128F9350130,1964,"You're the one - that's a-causing my blues 
you're the one - I don't want to lose 
you're the one that I'd always choose 
you're the that's meant for me 

You're the one - that I'm thinking of 
you're the one - that I'll always love 
you're the one - sent from heaven above 
you're the one that's meant for me 

Sometimes you make me feel so bad 
you make me cry deep in my heart 
I feel like an actor in a play 
who doesn't fit the part 

You're the one - and I want you to know 
you're the one - that thrills a-me so 
you're the one - I can't let you go 
you're the one that's meant for me"
2,Bobby Vinton,Trouble Is My Middle Name,TRJGFJB128F4265954,1964,"Hello, little girl, goodbye, little girl 
I'm not your kind of guy, little girl 
I'll only make you cry, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Each kiss, little girl, is sweet, little girl 
They sweep me off my feet, little girl 
But no more must our lips meet, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

I'm just a born wanderer driftin' by one day 
Each place that I've been, heartbreak moved in 
So I'll move on my way 

In time, little girl, you'll find, little girl 
I've been really kind, little girl 
Not changing your name to mine, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Not changing your name to mine, little girl 
Trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 

Oh, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name 
FADE 
Yes, trouble (trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble) is my middle name"

Tell him to send me one or two more men
Back behind

Early time

Come in early in the mornin'
It will be on the track
I want you women to go down there
Into Union Station in the mo'nin
Make like you be in mournin'
Be glad when they gone"

Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers
Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby
There's a slick town, Barnaby
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle
Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby
Listen, Barnaby...

Put on your Sunday clothes, there's lots of world out there
Get out the brillantine and dime cigars
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white
In a perfumed night
Where the lights are bright as the stars!
Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
In one of those new horsedrawn open cars

[Cornelius and Barnaby]
We'll see the shows
At Delmonico's
And we'll close the town in a whirl
And we won't come home until we've kissed a girl!

[Dolly]
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about

[Both]
That Sunday shine
Is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look!

[Dolly and Ambrose]
Beneath your parasol, the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes

[Dolly, Ambrose, Cornelius, and Barnaby]
Get out your feathers
Your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes!

[Townspeople]
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about

Beneath your parasol, the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes
Get out your feathers
Your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes!

Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose
Get out your slickers, your flannel knickers
Your red suspenders and hose
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes!

[Dolly]
Ermengarde, stop sniveling - Don't cry on the valises!
We haven't missed the train, thank the Lord!
Lovely, you're improving - Now get all 11 pieces, 
We're 7 minutes late.
All Aboard!

All
All Aboard! All Aboard! 
All Aboard! All Aboard!
Put on your Sunday clothes there's lots of world out there
Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
To town we'll trot
To a smoky spot
Where the girls are hot as a fuse!
Put on your silk high hat and at the turned up cuff
We'll wear a hand made grey suede buttoned glove
We'll join the Astors
At Tony Pastor's
And this I'm positive of
That we won't come home
That we won't come home
No we won't come home until we fall in love!

I love my darlin' yes I do
I love her 'til the sea go dry
And if I thought she didn't love me
I'd take morphine and die

It was late last night when Willie come home
She made one rap on the door
 ""Is that you Willie? I'd like to know
Darlin' don't you rap no more""

The last good word I heard my mother say
Sonny come hold my hand/head
Oh me, oh my never let a dollar by

I pawned my watch an' I pawned my chain
I pawned my gold diamond ring
If that don't settle my drunken spree
Lord I'll never drink no more

You had me ??darn?? my ??? ??? 
An' all my dirty clothes
It was late last night when Willie come home
She made one rap on the door
 ""Is that you Willie? I'd like to know

Planned out ahead
You took my hand and it felt so good
And this is what you said

'Baby won't you be my man

Yes, I'll be your man

8,Cornelis Vreeswijk,Min polare Per,TRBBNBO128E0795075,1964,"Min polare Per är borta,
Han finns inte längre här.
Han kom i ett gräl tillkorta
Med den som han hade kär.
Hon sa: ""Stick iväg på stubben!
Stick inte hit snoken igen!""
Så Per tog sin Mats ur skolan kan jag tro
För jag har inte sett 'en sen.
För jag har inte sett 'en sen.

Min polare Per har stuckit sin kos,
Och jag undrar hur han kan ha't.
Han blev blåst av bruden som han bodde hos,
Och jag tror han blev desperat.
Kanhända han stuckit till sjöss igen,
Till Siam och Singapore.
Eller också har han bara låst in sig nånstans
För att klämma en stilla tår.
För att klämma en stilla tår.

Är polaren Per på torken?
Det kunde man nästan tro.
Att han dränkt sin sorg under korken
För att få någonstans att bo.
Han kan ha tagit in på ett billigt hotell
Och kört med en billig vals.
Men det kan också tänkas att han gått på nån krog,
Och då är det ingen fara alls.
Och då är det ingen fara alls.

Är det nån som har sett min polare Per,
Han är skyldig mig femti spänn.
Han vart blåst av bruden som han hade kär,
Och jag har inte sett 'en sen.
Det vore inte dumt att få tag i karl'n
Och få säga ett ord eller två.
Det är klart det är marigt att bli blåst av en brud,
Men man kan väl ta det lugnt ändå?
Men man kan väl ta det lugnt ändå?

Jag har sökt polaren Per överallt,
Jag har sökt genom hela stan.
Jag har sökt 'en på Norr och på Söder,
Jag har sökt 'en i Gamla Stan.
För polaren Per är min polare,
Det kommer man ej ifrån,
Och vad tror du hans gamla mamma ska säga
När hon saknar sin ende son?
När hon saknar sin ende son?"
9,Mary Wells,My Guy,TRJHZGS12903CE9854,1964,"Nothing you can say can tear me away
From my guy
Nothing you could do, 'cause I'm stuck like glue
To my guy

I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we stick together
I'm tellin' you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you could do could make me be untrue
To my guy  (my guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie
To my guy (my guy)

I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful and I'm gonna
You'd best be believing
I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop
As a matter of taste to be exact
He's my ideal as a matter of fact

No muscle bound man could take my hand
From my guy (my guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place
Of my guy (my guy)

He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy, we are
There's not a man today who can take me away
From my guy

No muscle bound man could take my hand

10,Phil Ochs,Talking Cuban Crisis (LP Version),TRUGKKB128F1473B0B,1964,"It was just a little while ago I glued my ears to the radio
The announcer was sayin' we'd better beware
A crisis was hanging - a wave from the air
Crawlin' on the ground
Swimmin' in the sea
Headin' for me

Well, I didn't know if I was for or agin' it
He was yellin' and screamin' a mile a minute
Well, he said ""Here comes the President
But first this word from Pepsodent
Have whiter teeth
Have cleaner breath
When you're facin' nuclear death""

And then President John began to speak
And I knew right away he wouldn't be weak
Well, he said he'd seen some missile bases
And terrible smiles on Cuban faces
Close Pictures
Carryin' land reform too far
Giving land to the USSR

Well, he said we mustn't be afraid
We're settin' up a little blockade
Put our ships along the Cuban shores
And if the Russian bear yells and roars,
We'll let him have it

From Turkey and Greece, Formosa and Spain
The peaceful West European Plain
From Alaska and Greenland we'll use our means
And twenty thousand submarines
We're gonna teach the Russians a lesson
For trying to upset the balance of power

Now most Americans stood behind
The President and his military minds
But me, I stood behind a bar
Dreamin' of a spaceship getaway car
Head for mars
Any other planet that has bars
Like Gerde's Folk City

Yes, it seemed the President's stand was strong and plain
But some Republicans was a-goin' insane
And they still are
They said our plan was just too mild
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Let's sink Cuba into the sea
And give 'em back democracy
Under the water

Well, the deadline was set for ten o'clock
For a cold war it was a-gettin' hot
Well, the Russians tried, the Russians failed
Homeward bound those missiles sailed
Mr. Khruschev said, ""Better Red than dead."""

Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart 
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do?

Every time you go away
I always say
""This time it's goodbye, dear""
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you I'd die, dear

Knowing I love you so

14,Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,TRDNGGB128F42AE4C5,1964,"Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside a doorway as thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing

Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning

Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
As the clanging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder

Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations

Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'

Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended

Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'"
15,Brenda Holloway,Every Little Bit Hurts,TRYDNGV12903CD9FBD,1964,"Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go

Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts

You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you

I can't take this
Loneliness you've given me
I can't go on
Giving my life away

Oh, come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the
Things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me, yeah

16,Phil Ochs,Lou Marsh (LP Version),TRODZMI128F1473B04,1964,"On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting late
There were young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hate
And Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks
For one man is no army when the city turns its back

Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight
And death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long
For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall
And shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all"

Wonder if my Celia sleeps, wonder if she cries
If hate must be my prison lock, love must be the key

They kept my Celia through the war, they keep her from me still.

Que dans la soie et la dentelle

De bonheur
Si tu veux ce soir cueillir le printemps de mes jours
Et l'amour en mon cur
Pour connaître la joie nouvelle
Du premier baiser
Je sais
Qu'au seuil des amours éternelles
Il faut que je sois la plus belle

Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone

And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'

Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall

The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls

And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging

Well, there she is. Let's ask her.
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mm-hmm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Uh-uh
By the way, where'd you meet him?

I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture? (yes, we see)
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack

My folks were always putting him down (down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(Whatcha mean when ya say that he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack

One day my dad said, ""Find someone new""
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
(Whatcha mean when ya say that ya better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you the leader of the pack

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard, I'll never know

Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!

I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack

The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone"

When we walked and kissed

Then she turned And said
We'd better part

Your great-great grandfather from Indian blood sprang
And you feel in your heart for these ones

Oh it's written in books and in song
That we've been mistreated and wronged
Well over and over I hear the same words
From you good lady and you good man
Well listen to me if you care where we stand
And you feel you're a part of these ones

When a war between nations is lost
The loser, we know, pays the cost
But even when Germany fell to your hands
Consider dear lady, consider dear man
You left them their pride and you left them their land
And what have you done to these ones

Has a change come about Uncle Sam
Or are you still taking our lands
A treaty forever George Washington signed
He did dear lady, he did dear man
And the treaty's being broken by Kinzua Dam
And what will you do for these ones

Oh, it's all in the past you can say
But it's still going on here today
The government now want the Iroquois land
That of the Senaca and the Cheyenne
It's here and it's now you can help us dear man
Now that the buffalo's gone."

Gazing at the distant lights
In the starry sky

They say that all good things must end someday
Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so
To say goodbye to you
Wish you didn't have to go
No, no, no, no

And when the rain beats against my window pane
I'll think of summer days again
And dream of you

Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so

I'm younger than that now

""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed

Spoke from my skull, I dreamed

Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history

Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school

""Equality,"" I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach

My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect

Good and bad, I'd define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop

Zapata and Villa have died there, fighting in vain.
Rube'n Jaramillo kept up the tradition, he fought for the land once again.
He lived for the land, and there on the land he was slain.

A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
But all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

The greedy capiques* have stolen and plundered the land,
With pistoleros they ruled with a cold iron hand.
The poor campesinos could stand it no longer, resistance was starting to grow.
Jaramillo decided to fight for a new Mexico.

A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
But all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

For twenty long years he fought and he struggled and tried,
Epifania, his wife, always there at his side.
Often surrounded, he always was hounded, they searched for him near, far, and wide:
A man of deep sorrow, but also a man of deep pride.

A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
But all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done.

Two thousand peasants he led to their long-promised land,
And the army's revenge killed the wife and the sons and the man.
His assasins rejoiced with their whiskey and women, they laughed and they danced on his grave.
Now the land waits again for another to ride on the waves.

A forty-five bullet has ended the life of a man who had lived by the gun,
But all of the bullets of Mexico cannot undo all the work that he's done."

And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I've got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many young poor boy
And God, I know I'm one"

72,Woody Guthrie,Talking Dust Bowl Blues,TRKXQQF12903CCB6D7,1964,"Back in 1927
I had a little farm and I called that heaven
Well, the prices up and the rain come down
And I hauled my crops all into town
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries
Fed the kids, and raised a family

Rain quit and the wind got high
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine
And I poured it full of this gas-i-line
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin'
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl

Way up yonder on a mountain road
I had a hot motor and a heavy load
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin'
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin'
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller
Said it was en-gine trouble

Way up yonder on a mountain curve
It's way up yonder in the piney wood
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you
The fiddles and the guitars really flew
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world
Scattered wives and childrens
All over the side of that mountain

We got out to the West Coast broke
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak
An' I bummed up a spud or two
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew
We poured the kids full of it
Mighty thin stew, though
You could read a magazine right through it
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it"

Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'

The night-time shadows disappear
And with them go all your tears
For the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy
So don't let the sun catch you cryin'

We know that cryin's not a bad thing
But stop your cryin' when the birds sing

It may be hard to discover
That you've been left for another
But don't forget that love's a game
And it can always come again

How much in love we used to be!

When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me!
I was born to love you
And I will never be free –
You'll always be a part of me!
Awho-ooo-ohhh-oh

When shadows fall
I pass the small cafe
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help
Recalling how it felt
To kiss and hold you tight!

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me!
I was born to love you
And I will never be free –
You'll always be a part of me!

The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just come back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there!

Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green
Along the stream that runs to sea

Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me

Gone my lover's dream
Lovely summer's dream
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears into the stream

Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind
And say that love has sinned
Leave my heart a-breaking
And making a moan
Murmur to the night
To hide the starry light
So none will find me sighing
And crying all alone

Weepin' willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down
Along the ground and cover me

When the shadows fall
Bend oh willow and weep for me"

What has happened to me?

Tell me why, when we danced until three
Tell me why, why my heart couldn't see
I never dreamed of romance
Never gave it a chance

When I think of how you looked that day
In your gown of silk and lace
Should have known the day you came my way
That this was the time and the place

Tell me why I keep fooling my heart
When I know it was love from the start
Why don't we give it a try?
If you know, tell me why

You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy Southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here,
Tonight, nobodys gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""
Askin' ME!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still at the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""Right now.
Right now!""

Then they pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

Disappears out to sea

93,Bob Dylan,The Times They Are A-Changin',TRIWFKO128F4264EEF,1964,"Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'

Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'

For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please, heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside ragin'

It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'

Please, get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'

And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'"

The way I should

Those big blue eyes you see are not for cryin'
You shouldn't treat her bad the way you do

As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow 
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation 
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation 
After the US revolution cornplanter was a chief 
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief 
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed 
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined 
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand 
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now 
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how 
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam 
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam 
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin 
It will drown the Indians graveyards cornplanter can you swim 
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground 
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south 
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth 
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site 
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right 
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way 
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay 
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea 
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring 
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling 
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time 
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine 
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill 
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill 
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow 
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow 
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you thirsty) 
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass shall grow"

Silver bells
What a world of merriment
Their melody foretells
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
In the icy air of night
All the heavens seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight
Keeping time, time, time
With a sort of Runic rhyme
From the tintinnabulation
That so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

Hear the mellow wedding bells
Golden bells
What a world of happiness
Their harmony foretells
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight
Through the dances and the yells
And the rapture that impels
How it swells
How it dwells
On the future
How it tells
From the swinging and the ringing of the molten golden bells
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
Of the rhyming and the chiming of the bells

Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells
What a tale of terror now
Their turbulency tells
Much too horrified to speak
Oh, they can only shriek
For all the ears to know
How the danger ebbs and flows
Leaping higher, higher, higher
With a desperate desire
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire
With the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
With the clamor and the clanging of the bells

Hear the tolling of the bells
Iron bells
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels
For all the sound that floats
From the rust within our throats
And the people sit and groan
In their muffled monotone
And the tolling, tolling, tolling
Feels a glory in the rolling
From the throbbing and the sobbing
Of the melancholy bells
Oh, the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells
Oh, the moaning and the groaning of the bells."

Over us all to reign

Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills

And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine

Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
To have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
It'll be the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (one more time, let's hold)

Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose

Someone to close his eyes for you, someone to close his heart.
Someone who will die for you and more.  + CHORUS

He drank and took the easy love
Of street girls that he knew

And he met a girl one day
Said ""come home with me tonight""
""Oh no!"" she cried ""I never will."" 
And she left him there alone

And the days went by, and days
Went by and they did long
For each other every hour
But still she'd not be bound

I never will be found
But think you not that I don't love
For my heart is ripe and full""

""How cold you are!"" he said
""I guess you must not care
For me. But tell me,
Where it is you'd go
For I'd take you anywhere""

""Then come to a forest green
Where I may love you free
Beyond the confines of your walls
And beyond the sweetest words""

""And beyond the mountains high
Beyond the fields of shame
And beyond the prettiest wedding ring
For I'd never take your name""

""And wander with me now
Or wander all forlorn
But know I love you, tearful one,
Much more than I can show""

He could not understand
He thought she could not care
""Oh, take me far away,"" she'd cried
And he could not hear her prayer

And he wandered off alone
To never know her dream
And she still dwells within the forest
Longing for his love

Or wander off alone
But know I love you, tearful one,
Much more than I can show"""

And in green-wood he lies slain.

I'll do as much for my true love,
As any young girl may,
I'll sit and mourn all on his grave,
For twelve months and a day.

And when twelve months and a day was passed,
The ghost did rise and speak,

And will no let me sleep?""

And blood from out the stone,
Go fetch me milk from a fair maid's breast
That young man never has known.""

Where we were want to walk,
The fairest flower that e'er I saw
Has withered to a stalk.""

The flower will never return,
And since I've lost my own true love,
What can I do but yearn.""

When will we meet again?""

Are green and spring up again."""

Is there anybody home?""
I was standin' on the steps
Feelin' most alone

When out comes a farmer
He must have thought that I was nuts
He immediately looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts

I fell down to
My bended knees
Saying ""I dig farmers
Don't shoot me, please""

He cocked his rifle
And began to shout
""Are you that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about?""

I said ""No, no, no
I'm a doctor and it's true
I'm a clean-cut kid
And I been to college too""

Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped
Out of La Dolce Vita

I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a nice
Pretty farm he had

He said ""What do doctors know
About farms, pray tell?""
I said ""I was born at the bottom
Of a wishing well""

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie
He said ""I guess you're tired""
He said it kind of sly

I said ""Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove""
He said ""I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove

Just one condition
You can go to sleep right now
That you don't touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cows""

I was sleepin' like a rat
When I heard something jerkin'
There stood Rita
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins

She said ""Would you like to take a shower?
I'll show you up to the door""
I said ""Oh, no, no
I've been through this movie before""

I knew I had to split
But I did not know how
When she said
""Would you like to take that shower now?""

Well, I couldn't leave
Unless the old man chased me out
'Cause I'd already promised
That I'd milk his cows

I had to say something
To strike him very weird
So I yelled
""I like Fidel Castro and his beard""

Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin' ""What's that I heard you say?""

I said, ""I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right""
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might

Rita mumbled something
'Bout her mother on the hill
As his fist, it hit the icebox
He said he's going to kill

Me if I don't get out the door
In two seconds flat
""You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat""

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun

And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers

Rita said ""Come back""
And he started to load
The sun was comin' up
And I was runnin' down the road

Well, I don't figure I'll be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job at a motel

He still waits for me
Constant on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I.

The folks I meet ain't always kind
Some are bad, some are good, some have done the best they could
Some have tried to ease my troublin' mind

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

I've been wanderin' through this land, doin' the best I can
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wonderin' too

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

Now I had a little girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
And she loved me till my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was driftin' away from me
And my good gal went off on a morning train

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

And I had a buddy way back home, but he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Frisco Bay
And sometimes when I've had a few, his old voice comes a-ringin' through
And I'm goin' out to see him some old day

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

Well, if you see me passin' by and you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace 'em up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound"

Alors le regard fier

Qui leur donnent leur vertu

Se plantent le nez au ciel
Se mouchent dans les étoiles

I saw the welcoming light
And stopped to rest for the night

I pulled in outside of the small motel he was there
And so I walked up to him
Asked where I could get something to eat
And he showed me where

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa

He took me to the café
Cnd he asked if I would stay, I said: ""Okay!""

The jukebox started to play
And night time turned into day

As we were dancin' closely
All of a sudden I lost control as he held me tight
And he kissed me, carressed me
Told me he die before he would let me out of his arms arms

She said she would never forget
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here

It's all new to me, like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on that she's the same one

From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock her voice once and talk
'Stead of acting like we never met

If she ain't feelin' well, then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt she seems too far out
For me to return to or chase

Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed, for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess
To anything I might have tried
If I was with her too long or I've done something wrong
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide

Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met

I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched

And if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""

You'll come back to me on bended knees
You're gonna be cryin'

My mind tells me I have to fight, but I can't help missing her

You better leave me alone, you better leave me alone
Until I can think about her without feeling sorry for myself
You better leave me be 'til I don't need her anymore
I don't wanna meet again until I'm sure I'm over her

By myself, feeling tired and wanting, is not like I thought it would be
Love just cannot end at parting, my world's dropped from under me

You better leave me alone, you better leave me alone
Until I can think about her without feeling sorry for myself
You better leave me be 'til I don't need her anymore

162,Bob Dylan,Only A Pawn In Their Game,TRACDTC128F426F7CE,1964,"A bullet from the back of a bush
Took Medgar Evers' blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name

A handle hid out in the dark, a hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim, behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game

A South politician preaches to the poor white man
""You got more than the blacks, don't complain
You're better than them, you been born with white skin""
They explain

And the Negro's name is used, it is plain
For the politician's gain as he rises to fame
And the poor white remains on the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame, he's only a pawn in their game

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool

He's taught in his school from the start, by the rule
That the laws are with him, to protect his white skin
To keep up his hate, so he never thinks straight 'bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame, he's only a pawn in their game

From the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he's taught how to walk in a pack, shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch

To hang and to lynch, to hide 'neath a hood
To kill with no pain like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name, but it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game

Today Medger Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun

You'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name, his epitaph plain
""Only a pawn in their game"""

It's one of those songs that are over and then,
It's one of those songs that start playin' again.

Yes, it's just one of those songs that you hear for awhile.
That comes into fashion then goes out of style.
It's one of those songs that you think you forgot,
But it's one of those songs you cannot.



Hey!!!!!!!!!

Because it's one of those songs that can make you recall a ride in the spring time a walk in the fall,
a day in the country, a night on the town, the sun coming up or the rain coming down or else the evening you parted
the morning you met, the love of your life you can never forget the reason is simple the memory belongs to one of those wonderful songs

Because it's one of those songs that's so easy to hear
You listen just once then you play it by ear
It's hummed on Veranda's it's strummed on Guitars
it's all you remember is ""la da da da  but later on you recall it's sung by the year You may start to smile you may shed a tear  You find that one part of your life time belongs to one of those wonderful songs , to one of those wonderful songs, to one of those wonderful songs"

But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you

Told me that I 
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me

And love comes love shows

Take this advice, and remember always in life:

Into each heart some tears must fall
Though you love and lose, you must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes
I said, sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together
No use crying forever
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

My mother once told me something
And every word is true
Don't waste your time on a fella
Who doesn't love you
He'll only mislead you
Only grieve you
Don't worry about him
Do without him
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

Well, if the fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
Don't let him get you down
There's other boys around
Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

I don't want nobody that don't want me
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me, now
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea
I don't need nobody that don't need me
'Cause there's too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't love me, now

With a silent prayer
Suddenly before my eyes,
You were standing there, oh

No more winter tears because
Now I'm holding you

Promise me you'll never leave

With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him

As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders

And swear words and sneering, and his tongue, it was a-snarling
And in a manner of minutes, on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears

Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table

And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane

Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never did nothing to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for your tears

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled

Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'

And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance, William Zanzinger with a six-months entence
Oh, you who philosophize disgrace, and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face, now's the time for your tears"

People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

And yet letting a grown-up pride 
Hide all the need inside 
Acting more like children than children 
Lovers are very special people 
They're the luckiest people in the world 
With one person one very special person 
A feeling deep in your soul 
Says you were half now you're whole 
No more hunger and thirst 
But first be a person who needs people

I'm just like him, the same as you
I'm everybody's brother and son
I ain't different than anyone

Ain't no use to talk to me 
It's just the same as talking to you

I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine

5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you better run 
99, 100 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I ask you how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first

Wowee!
Pretty scary!

Now I'm liberal, but to a degree
I want everybody to be free
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter

You must think I'm crazy!
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba

Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead

He's a weird monkey!
Very funky!

I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was falling in my face
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court

I gotta woman, she's so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude
Puts bubblegum in my food

She's funny
Wants my money
Calls me honey

Now I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife
Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf
I've got a million friends!

Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sister's home 
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women

Yippee!
I'm a poet, I know it
Hope I don't blow it

I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course

Carryin' the New York Times
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds

Well, you're probably wondering by now
Just what this song is all about
What's probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for

It's nothin'
It's something I learned over in England"

A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
A Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Vulgar words of anger
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

And as through your life you travel
Yes, as through your life you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home"

Show me the prisoner whose life has gone stale

With so many reasons why,
There but for fortune go you or I.

Show me the alley
Show me the train
Show me the hobo who sleeps out in the rain
And I'll show you, young man, 
With so many reasons why 
There but for fortune go you or I.

Show me the whiskey stains on the floor
Show me the drunkard as he stumbles out the door
And I'll show you, young man, 
With so many reasons why, 
There but for fortune go you or I.

Show me the country where the bombs had to fall
Show me the ruins of the buildings, once so tall
And I'll show you young man 
With so many reasons why, 
There but for fortune go you and I,
You and I."

Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real
Really mine

In the rain, in the dark, in the sun

Of your arms"

And he heard a low and a deadly cry.

Oh you bloody awful man.
My daughter's pain is all because of you.
You would not take her for your wedded wife,
And now it's a terrible thing that I must do.

Ever since the day we met 
I said I've been down hearted baby

You're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby 
And you're jealous when we're apart 
How blue can you get baby 
The answer is right here in my heart 

I gave you a brand new Ford 
But you said: I want a Cadillac 
I bought you a ten dollar dinner 
And you said: thanks for the snack 
I let you live in my pent house 
You said it just a shack 
I gave seven children 
And now you wanna give them back 
I said I've been down hearted baby 
Ever since the day we met

I've been standing by the jukebox
Hoping he'd ask me to dance
How I wish I could run to him and hug him
But a girl musn't make an advance

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy

But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Oh he's dancing with another
And he's holding her so tight
Wish I had nerve to cut right in and stop it
But a girl has to be polite

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes
I wish I were a boy

Now the record hop is over
And I think he caught my eye
Here he comes heading straight in my direction
There he goes, he's passing me by

Oh oh oh oh I'm a girl and it's wonderful
It fills my heart with joy
But sometimes, yes sometimes,

225,Phil Ochs,The Thresher (LP Version),TROFOJB128F1473B02,1964,"In Portsmouth town on the eastern shore
Where many a fine ship was born.
The Thresher was built
And the Thresher was launched
And the crew of the Thresher was sworn.

She was shaped like a tear
She was built like a shark
She was made to run fast and free.
And the builders shook their hands
And the builders shared their wine,
And thought that they had mastered the sea.

Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
Though the waves will never weep

They'll never weep.

And they marvelled at her speed
marvelled at her depth
marvelled at her deadly design.
And they sailed to every land
And they sailed to every port
Just to see what faults they could find.
Then they put her on the land
For nine months to stand
And they worked on her from stem to stern.
But they could never see
It was their coffin to be
For the sea was waiting for their return.

Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
And the waves will never weep
They'll never weep.

On a cold Wednesday morn
They put her her out to sea
When the waves they were nine feet high.
And they dove beneath the waves
And they dove to their graves
And they never said a last goodbye.
And its deeper and deeper
And deeper they dove
Just to see what their ship could stand.
But the hull gave a moan
And the hull gave a groan
And they plunged to the deepest darkest sand.

Now she lies in the depths
Of the darkened ocean floor
Covered by the waters cold and still.
Oh can't you see the wrong
She was a death ship all along
Died before she had a chance to kill.

And she´ll never run silent,
And she´ll never run deep,
For the ocean had no pity
And the waves, they never weep,
They never weep."
