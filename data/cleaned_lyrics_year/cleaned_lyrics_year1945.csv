0,"Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup",Cool Disposition,TRMRAXY128F9349C76,1945,"My baby a kind hearted woman
So lovely and so sweet she's so kind 
Yeah she's a kind hearted woman
So lovely and so sweet she's so kind 

She's got such a cool disposition
She just makes me love her all the time 
She got me doin' things
Peoples I just can't sleep at night 

She got me doin' things
You know boys I just can't sleep at night 
I don't eat my breakfast in the mornin'
And my teeth and tongue begin to fight 

Yes, she's 41 through the shoulders
29 in the waist

I'll never find another woman
To take my baby's place 

She's so lovin'
She's so sweet she's so kind 
She's got such a cool disposition
Makes me love her all the time"
1,Edith Piaf,Le Chant Du Pirate,TRZYLSO128F93591CB,1945,"(Ho, hisse, ho)
(Ho, hisse, ho)
(Ho, hisse, ho)

Marchant par-dessus les tempêtes
Courant dans la vague et le vent
Chassant les blanches goélettes
C'est nous, ceux du gaillard d'avant
C'est nous qui sommes les corsaires
Brigands tout comme étaient nos pères

Ho, hisse et ho, miséricorde
Pour nous tenir au bout d'une corde
Faudra d'abord nous attraper
Faudra d'abord nous aborder
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon noir
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon haut
Tant que le vent pousse la frégate
Y a du bon temps pour les pirates
Tant que la mer est par-dessous
C'est le corsaire qui tient l'bon bout
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon noir
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon haut

Tant pis pour les yeux de ta mère
Tant pis pour la reine et le roi
Tant mieux si tu deviens corsaire
Jésus était un hors-la-loi
Viens donc fréquenter les étoiles
Dormir dans le ventre des voiles

Ho, hisse et ho, miséricorde
Pour nous tenir au bout d'une corde
Faudra d'abord nous attraper
Faudra d'abord nous aborder
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon noir
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon haut
Tant que le vent pousse la frégate
Y a du bon temps pour les pirates
Tant que la mer est par-dessous
C'est le corsaire qui tient l'bon bout
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon noir
Ho, hisse, ho, pavillon haut"
2,Ernest Tubb,It's Been So Long Darling,TRGYEMK128F92ECFF9,1945,"It's been so long darling since I had to go away
It's been so long darling and I can't forget that day
Although you never mentioned it you cried that whole day long
It's been so long darling but now I'm coming home
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling do you really realize
Just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you

It's been so long darling but it won't be long now
It's been so long darling but I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waiting as you did in days gone by
It's been so long darling please don't blame me if I cry
It's been so long darling..."
3,Frank Sinatra,Ol' Man River,TRGTEGE128F934A3F9,1945,"Here we all work 'long the Mississipi.
Here we all work while the white folks play.
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset.
Gettin' no rest till the judgement day.
Don't look up and don't look down.
You don't das make the boss man frown.
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead.
Let me go 'way from the Mississipi,
Let me go 'way from the white man boss.
Show me that stream called the River Jordan,
That's the old stream thata I long to cross.
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along.
He don't plant tatters, and he don't plant cotton
And them waht plants'em, are soon forgotten.
But Ol' Man River, just keeps rollin' along.
You and me, we sweat and strain,
Body all achin' and racked with pain.
Tote that barge and lift that bail.
You get alittle drunk and you lands in jail.
I gets weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of livin', but I'm scared of dyin'
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along."
4,Frank Sinatra,Dream,TRAOOWB12903CC889F,1945,"Get in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
He's got a million kinds of stardust
Pick you fav'rite brand, and

Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream"
5,Frank Sinatra,Nancy (With The Laughing Face),TREYALT128F42697B7,1945,"If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case 
On Nancy, with the laughing face

She takes the winter and she makes it summer
And summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughing face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringing
Well she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say ""hello""

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
Sorry for you she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy, with the laughing face"
6,Sister Rosetta Tharpe,Strange Things Happening Every Day,TRGDTLV128F4240A0B,1945,"Oh, we hear church people say
They are in this holy way
There are strange things happening everyday

On that last great judgment day
When they drive them all away
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

If you want to view the climb
You must learn to quit your lyin'
There are strange things happening everyday

If you hew right to the line
You can live right all the time
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
There are strange things happening everyday

Jesus is the holy life
Turning darkness into light
There are strange things happening everyday

He gave the blind man sight
Then he praised Him with all his might
There are strange things happening everyday

Everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday

There are strange things happening everyday

There are strange things happening everyday"
7,Sister Rosetta Tharpe,Two Little Fishes And Five Loaves Of Bread,TRFKOQO128F4240A0C,1945,"A crowd of people
Went out in the desert
To listen to what the good Lord said
All day long they heard the good Lord's word
And they got hungry and had to be fed 
On only two little fishes 
And five loaves of bread

The Lord's disciples
Began to get worried
And he took them out
to scratch his head
But what could he do
â€˜cause each one knew
There was a big crowd 
That had to be fed
with only two little fishes 
And five loaves of bread

The good Lord stood up
And told his disciples
To bring him the loaves 
of bread instead
Bring the fishes by
And let him try
A little idea he had in his head
About those two little fishes 
And five loaves of bread

He broke the bread up
And also the fishes
And then his disciples
Went ahead
But the more passed round
The more they found
With lots left over
When all had been fed

On only two little fishes 
And five loaves of bread
Hear what I said
If we all helped one another
Then the world would be fed
On only two little fishes 
And five loaves of bread"
8,T-Bone Walker,Mean Old World,TRNKFLR12903CC54AC,1945,"This is a mean old world,
Baby to live in by yourself.
This is a mean old world,
Baby to live in by yourself.
Cant get the woman you love,
Cause you know shes lovin someone else.

Well I drink to keep from worryin
Baby and I smile to keep from cryin'.
Yes I drink to keep from worryin
And you know I smile to keep from cryin.
Thats to keep the public from knowin
Just what I have on my mind."
