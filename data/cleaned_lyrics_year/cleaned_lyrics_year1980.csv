0,Hassisen Kone,Rappiolla,TRAGGUX128F423F29A,1980,"Sinä kuuntelet tv-tuolissas
Minun paskaista ääntäni
Ja olet aivan liian laiska
Jotta kanavan toiselle kääntäisit
Vaimollesi huudat:
""Tuo sitä kaljaa,
Eihän tätä kestä selvinpäin
Kun huligaanit huutaa
Ja raggarit räyhää
Ja elämä on muutenkin niin läyhää""

Jos rappio on sitä että rakastaa
Ottaa hetkestä kii
Eikä tahdo tappaa
On mukavaa olla
Rappiolla
Olla vaan täysi nolla
Rappiolla on hyvä olla
Ei huolet paina
Ei rasitu polla
Antaudu sinäkin suosiolla
Taikka anna meidän olla!

ÄO:ni on kuulemma
Normaalia parempi
Miksi kouluja pelkään?
Olenko muita arempi?
Vitut minä mikään viisas ole
Tahdon elää vain kuin ihminen
Päästä irti isoveli
Kuule kutsua jumalten

Jos rappio on sitä että rakastaa
Ottaa hetkestä kii
Eikä tahdo tappaa
On mukavaa olla
Rappiolla
Olla vaan täysi nolla
Rappiolla on hyvä olla
Ei huolet paina
Ei rasitu polla
Antaudu sinäkin suosiolla
Taikka anna meidän olla!

Anna meidän olla
Anna meidän olla
Anna meidän olla"
1,Madness,Baggy Trousers,TRQLCBM128F92DC640,1980,"Naughty boys and nasty schools
headmaster's breaking all the rules
having fun and playing fools
smashing up the woodwork tools

All the teachers in the pub
passing round the ready rub
trying not to think of when
the lunchtime bell will ring again

(chorus)
Oh what fun we had
but did it really turn out bad
all i learnt at school
was how to bend not break the rules
oh what fun we had
but at the time it seemed so bad
trying different ways to
make a difference to 

The headmaster's had enough today
all the kids have gone away
gone to fight with next door's school
every term that is the rule
sits alone and bends his cane
same old backsides again
all the small ones tell tall tales
walking home and squashing snails

(chorus)

Lots of girls and lots of boys
lots of smells and lots of noise
playing football in the park
kicking pushbikes after dark
baggy trousers dirty shirt
pulling hair and eating dirt
teacher comes to break it up
back of the head with a plastic cup

(chorus)

Baggy trousers baggy trousers
Baggy trousers 
Baggy trousers baggy trousers
Baggy trousers
Baggy trousers baggy trousers
Baggy trousers"
2,The Nolans,Gotta Pull Myself Together,TRBLFER128F92EB509,1980,"Now that I know,
why did I doubt you,
I let you go,
Now I'm without you,
Thought I was cool,
Imagination,
I was the fool,
Fell to temptation

But you won't see me cry,
'Cause its no good,
Since you said goodbye.
And now honey I gotta stop,
Gotta start pickin' up,
Gotta pull myself together,
Honey, I'm breakin' up,
Now that we ain't makin' up,
Just gotta pull myself together.

I was so sure,
It wouldn't upset me,
so I closed the door,
Why did you let me,
I lost control,
Out for sensation,
I'm in the cold,
Sad situation,
I try hard not to say,
I t hurt so bad,
Since you went away."
3,David Essex,Silver Dream Machine,TRWFLYM128E0784425,1980,"I've a dream, silver dream machine.
Here am I, I'm going for another try,
Flying high, I've got a lot of love inside.
Is there love enough now to get me through?
Yeah, I know now where I'm going to -
Not to lose now but to win;
Tell me, how do I begin?
I've a dream, silver dream machine.
Well, alright, I've got a lot of love to try,
'Cause love is the thing,
And freedom is the word I sing.
Is there force now, yeah, to get us through?
Yeah, it's deep in me and it's deep in you -
Not to lose now but to win,
Tell me how do I begin?
I've a dream, silver dream machine;
Silver dream, silver dream machine.

Is there love enough now to get me through?

4,The Cure,M,TRXOCOL128E07890A9,1980,"Hello image
Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn but you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong

You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight

Help yourself
But tell me the words before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets to remember the end
And escape someday

You'll fall in love with somebody else again tonight

Take a step
You move in time but it's always back
The reasons are clear
Your face is drawn and ready for the next attack"
5,Wanda Jackson,Right Or Wrong,TRNNNUS12903D13D78,1980,"Right or wrong I'll be with you 
I'll do what you want me to 
I believe that I belong 
By your side, right or wrong 

Right or wrong, it's gotta be 
Always you, always me 
Won't you take me along
To be with you right or wrong 

If it's wrong to love you
It can't be wrong for me to care
If you say you love me
My life  with you  I'll share

Right or wrong, day by day 
All my love, all the way
I believe that I belong
By your side, right  or  wrong
Right or wrong!!"

7,Triumvirat,Roxy,TRCWEEN128F1461B9C,1980,"J.K. is charming up his hand-wash love affairs
Softly cruising among the empty faces they wear
Each night it's easy to get a love
Alright get get get
And as I sit and I watch as he passes my way
Loving just one of his fourhundredeleven fiancées
Licking all his spacy fantasies
He's the ballroom blitz, honey

So I think of all my flic-flacs
And I wonder why I come here every night
To watch the osmosis of creepers of art and design
But another southern comfort
has to comfort that old jumping heart of mine
Sensational flight now
Just in a Roxy night
And the all-time black suited gambling boy
Is playing cards
And he's got to give his Mustang away
to my manager
He's got black cards
The Ramones upon the juke box’re simply doping the guys
While the gypsy boys are painting my senses
Red hot blood
Stitch Stitch
Don't let the chick
With these stiletto heels walk by
She's got the nerve to share my vicious side
And the leather kid from behind the bar
He jumps right into the fight
Precious moments
Just another Roxy night
So come on all you doormen
Kiss my vertical smile
Ruff me up if you want
That's your stupid way to get high
When your mind is low
So
I'm knocking out a monster telling me I should go
He's a weekend casanova, a Travolta or so
What?
I don't know - tell me
The last thing on my mind
Is slow motion of what I desire
A silly kind of Kubrik
A clockwork that's out of time
And I end up in collapsing
on the bartender under champaigne on ice
With Freddy and her numbers
All in a Roxy night"
8,Gino Vannelli,Living Inside Myself,TRRYKZU128F934A3B5,1980,"In my life
I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wond'ring in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need a guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how all the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost"
9,Daniel Johnston,Lazy,TRWGJUO12903CDF841,1980,"Well I made some mistakes but
I ain't learned a lesson 
that I don't wanna hear about responsibilities
I got less important things to do 

I'm lazy - Oh yeah
Lost hopes and dreams down an empty road
see no tomorrow
but I got love for you girl
I'm just too lazy to give it to you

I'm lazy - Oh yeah
Well I quit college and I quit my job
I think I'll quit life
yeah I'm gonna quit again
I think I'll quit one last time

I'm a quitter - Oh yeah
Quit this, quit that, quit everything 
I quit everything I ever began 
Quit that, quit this, quit everything 
I never finished anything I ever started 
but I think I'm gonna quit being a quitter"
10,Hassisen Kone,ILOISESTI HAMMONDILLA,TRLMOQC128F4278663,1980,"Aamulla kun herään hampaat kalisten
Seassa lumen ja jääkarhujen,
Suurimmat karhut syrjään potkin.
Nousen, kusen ja kuulen,
Kun hän
Pistää iloisesti hammondilla,
Pistää iloisesti hammondilla.

Yläkerran sulotar kaunis ja nuori,
Hän soittaa kuin Esa Katajavuori.
Ja minäkin tartun kitaraan,
Yhdessä me soittelemme dapadapadaa.
Ja hän
Pistää iloisesti hammondilla,
Pistää iloisesti hammondilla.

Urut soi ja postiluukust tippuu Kotilies.
Mitäs sitä turhia työtön mies
Lukemaan, kun urut soi tralalaa
Ja on niin saatanan mukavaa,
Ja hän
Pistää iloisesti hammondilla. (4x)"
11,Thin Lizzy,Genocide,TRNMXDY128E0784323,1980,"When they try to tell you knowledge is a dangerous thing
""It's such a dangerous thing""
The people that have it are the people that sin
And the people that need it are the people that can never win
""They can never win""
Let me get you out of here, little broken wing

There are people round here that are right
There are people round here that like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
There are people round here that don't kindly to the killing of the buffalo

When they tear up all the treaties and break up all the plans
""They break up all the plans""
Did you do your duty and kill on command? 
Did you know the red man used to roam this land? 
""He used to roam this land""
Now the souls of lost warriors blow across the sands

People round here they get it right
People round here we like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
People round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo, oh no

So listen to my story and listen to it well
""You better listen well""
Listen to the glory of the gory details of the tale I tell
Did you know the red man very well? 
""I used to know him well""
Did you know the hunting ground before it became a hell? 

There are people round here that are right
There are people round here that like to sleep at night
There are people round here I don't know
There are people round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo

The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing
The killing of the
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing
The killing

So listen to my story of genocide
How they were hunted and slaughtered till there was no place left to hide
Did you know the red man used to hold his head with pride? 
Till every man, woman and child were destroyed

There are people round here that get it right
There are people round here that couldn't sleep at night
There are people round here I don't know
There are people round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo

There are people round here that understand
There are people round here that couldn't give a damn
There are people round here that go slow
There are people round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo
There are people round here that don't take too kindly to the killing of the buffalo

The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing
The killing of the
They're killing all the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o
The killing of the buffala-o

They're killing all the

12,Stiff Little Fingers,Wait And See,TRRZCBV128EF34B695,1980,"When we started we thought we were great
Tho' nobody else agreed
Just you and I wasting our time
Playing and singing out of key
And they said we played too loud
Cos we didn't play for their crowd
We just told them 'Wait and see'

We had no money but still we went on
Trying to get some gear
A smashed up cymbal and an old snare drum
Our financial state was clear
And they said we should give up
They said we didn't have a hope
And we still told them 'Wait and see'

We worked harder got better in every way
Got some other friends involved
Pretty soon we found we knew how to play
We'd got all our problems solved
But I swear to this day
I could see you drifting away
But I told myself 'Wait and see'

Then came the day you said goodbye
We tried to smile but had to cry
You knew that you'd be missed
And we wished you all the best
But still we wished you would stay

Till then you were a part of everything
And everything that might have been
And now that everything has turned into what is
If you'd have waited you'd have seen
But you gave yourself the sack
Now there's no turning back
Now all your future's 'Wait and see'

You're not good enough, You're not good enough
You're not good enough to be a dance band
They told us
But we're not giving up, We're not giving up
we're not giving up
We'll show them"

I'm seein' many colours but the only one
That's coming through is red,
And it's stoppin' me dead tryin' to make some tracks
But my feet are feeling like lead,
Stop being blead, stop being blead

Oh my things aren't the same,
Anyone could see that if I stayed much longer,
I'd be tamed 
We stopped playing games 
I'm not pointing fingers but I'm not gonna take the blame 
Playin' all your games, taking all your blames 

I said oh no, I don't even care,
I guess I'll be seein' you,
I guess I'll be leaving you today,
We're just not a pair,
I know you've been trying but I just can't bear to tell a lie'
Stop tellin' me all your lies
Stop tellin' me all your lies

Let me take you by the hand,
Try to understand, walk me to a land,
Try to understand,
But I ain't nothing but a man

I've got a sandstorm blowin' in my head,
I'm seein' many colours but the only one
That's coming through Is red,

You know how we feel, we can't go on pretending,
And we've just got to fix the deal,
Gotta make it real
Gotta make it real"

Takin' down your name
They say they know your price

It's hard to see what's right in front of you-
They're takin' you down

They're gonna write you up
And then they're gonna write you off
They're makin' you so hard
You never can be soft

There's gotta be a limit
To what you're gonna stand
Oh, they're slappin' you up
Takin' all that they can

You can't believe what we're headed to-
They're takin' you down
They'll be breakin' you down

You should have taken me,
It was so damn cold I should'a held ya,

When she led me home,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' alone.

She said you're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me,
You're wastin' time,
You're takin' a chance on me.

I should have got the Rambler,
Back seat movie for two,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' alone with you. 

You should have seen her daddy,
'cause he said she had to go,
I spent too much time for one night,
Bein' all alone.

I know the score
You're trying to be wild and carefree 
You really can't take it no more

I'm trying to think 
I can't think clear 
Everybody's talking at me 
It's gone foggy in here

But as time goes marching home again 
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time?
Or was this time well spent?

And if it marches back again 
And orders me to smile 
Then will I be prepared?
Or will it take a little while?

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me 
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

I've listened to you
Please listen to me 
Don't tie us up completely 
Just wait and see

I'll try very hard for a second chance
Which is it to be? One dead romance
Or a handful of dreams? Please tell me
It makes all the difference to me
And I really want to know
I've tried so many things I suddenly regret
If I could only compromise and you'd try to forget 
A single kiss, a lover's wish, the past dissolves in tears 
The present burns inside of me, the future disappears

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now 
I'll make it up to you somehow

Don't leave me 
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow

Could I ever be happy without somebody who really cared
Somebody like you

I said you chatty chatty (x3) too much

You talk about people that you don't know

You talk about things you don't know how

When I needed your love, baby, your'e always gone

In my life I know that something is missing
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving

I need more loving baby, I need more kissing
Now I want (?) that you got

They say a rolling stone never gathers no moss
One day we will slow down and find that love is lost

In my life I know that something is missing
Grains of sand is really all you've been giving

I need more loving baby, I need more kissing
Now I want (?) that you got

Did I hear you say you love me
Well baby I've got to know
‘Cause if you really really love me
You've got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression
By showing me warm expressions
Put me in the right direction
With tender love and affection
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Did I hear you say you need me
Well baby tell me the truth
‘Cause if you really really need me
My sweetness here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing
‘Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying
And I'll be yours without delaying
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Sounds so good
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you

Did I hear you say you want me 
Now please don't give me no mess
‘Cause if you really really want me
You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me ‘til I beg don't stop it
‘Cause I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Baby, if you love me let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me let me hear you say

I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were

With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best

Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da, Da Da Da
Da Da Da, Da Da Da-aa

The passion burning in your heart
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go

Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world
Baby you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world
Oh, Oh, Oh, took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to into this cold, cold world
I would not do that to a dog
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

33,Nic Jones,The Little Pot Stove,TRTIRAQ12903CAF116,1980,"How the winter blizzards blow, and the whaling fleet's at rest,
Tucked in Leigh harbor's sheltered bay, safely anchored ten abreast.
The whalers at their stations, as from shed to shed they go,
Carry little bags of coal with them, and a little iron stove.

In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal.

The fireman Paddy worked with me on the engine stiff and cold.
A stranger to the truth was he - there's not a lie he hasn't told.
And he boasted of his gold mine, and of all the hearts he'd won,
And his bonny sense of humor shone just like a ray of sun.

In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal.

We labored seven days a week, with cold hands and frozen feet.
Bitter days and lonely nights making grog and having fights
Salt fish and whalemeat sausage, fresh penguin eggs a treat
And we trudged along to work each day through icy winds and sleet.

In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal.

Then one day we saw the sun and factory ships' return.
Meet your old friends, sing a song; hope the season won't be long,
Then homeward bound when it's over; we'll leave this icy cove,
But I always will remember that little iron stove.

In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal."

Listen to the voice of Buddha
Saying stop your sericulture
Little people like your offspring
Boiled alive for some Gods stocking
Buddha's watching, Buddha's waiting

Just because the kid's an orphan
Is no excuse for thoughtless slaying
People don't forget this torture
Just because you call her mother
Doesn't mean that she's your better

Once more with the voice of Buddha
He'll say carry on your slaughter
Who cares for the little children
You may slice with no conviction
Blind revenge on a blameless victim

Why can't I explain?
Why do I feel this pain?

She doesn't understand
She doesn't realise
She takes it all the wrong way

And having a good time on a crummy day is our game.

Quiche Quiche Lorraine
Quiche Quiche Lorraine

Everyday I take her out. Yea!
She runs around, she shouts out and barks, Yea!
Cause she's a good doggie
She's a sweet, sweet, sweet PUPPY! Arf Arf
And I know she'll stick by me, Yea! Arf Arf

Oh no! Here comes a Great Dane
Drivin' down the lane
Quiche, Quiche, Quiche come back here;
Don't leave me.
I'll go insane.
I'll go insane.

How do you like that?
Has anybody seen a dog dyed dark green.
About two inches tall, with a strawberry blonde fall;
Sunglasses and a bonnet
and designer jeans with appliques on it?
The dog that brought me so much joy
Left me wallowing in pain.
Quiche Lorraine.

I'll show her!
Do you see the key in my hand?
I'm gonna throw it in the lake.
Yea, you've been so rotten to me,
You take the cake.
I'm just gonna lock the door to your kennel,
and just you try and come back to me.
Yea, you'll see.

Quiche Quiche Lorraine You mangey mutt.
Quiche Quiche Lorraine I'm talking about Quiche!
Quiche Quiche Lorraine Quiche Lorraine!"

You kept me warm on tropic nights
Kept me smilin'
Your naked body lying on the sand
Lady of the Island
I'm your man
I love you and you know it
Like the waves that kiss the sand you somehow show it
Here on your island I would love to stay
Like a bird too soon I'll fly away
When I say I'm leaving you it breaks my heart
'Cause you know I wanna stay with you forever
Your love is fine, time after time
And I savor every sip and every swallow
Your brown-skinned body lying on the sand

Leaving you breaks my heart"

Oh, barroom eyes shine vacancy
To see her you gotta look hard

Wounded deep in battle
I stand stuffed like some solider undaunted
To her cheshire smile, I'll stand on file
She's all I ever wanted

You let your blue walls get in the way of these facts, honey
Get your carpetbaggers off my back
Girl, give me time to cover my tracks
She said, ""Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks""
But they're not what I came for
Oh, I came for so much more
And I know you know that, too
And I know you know that's true

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you, I came for you

Crawl into my ambulance
Your pulse is getting weak
Reveal yourself all to me now
While you got the strength to speak

'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue
With their oxygen masks
But I could give it all to you now
If only you could ask

Don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's late
It's not your lungs this time but your heart holds your fate
Don't give me my money back, don't want it anymore
It's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you stretched out on the floor
I've broken all your windows and I rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to fight my wars
And you should know that's true
You should know that, too

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you, I came for you

Don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's late

Lost inside this manned collision,
Just to see that what to be is,
Perfectly my fantasy,
I came to know with now dismay,
That in this world we all must pay,
Pay to write, pay to play, pay to cum, pay to fight!
And all in time,
With just our minds,
We soon will find what's left behind,
Not long ago when things were slow,
We all got by with what we know,
The end is near,
Hearts filled with fear,
Don't want to listen to what they hear,
And so it's now we choose to fight,
To stick up for our bloody right,
The right to ring, the right to dance, the right to dance,
The right is ours...we'll take the chance!!

A Piece apart,
A piece of wisdom,

Down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night, I wait to get caught

When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters

Nunca me creo en la cima o en la gloria
Eso es un gran fantasma
Creado por generaciones pasadas
Atascado en el camino de la vida

La realidad duerme sola en un entierro
Y camina triste por el sueño del más bueno
La realidad baila sola en la mentira
Y en un bolsillo tiene amor y alegrías
Un dios de fantasías
La guerra y la poesía

Tengo de todo para ver y creer
Para obviar o no creer
Y muchas veces me encuentro solitario
Llorando en el umbral de la vida

Busco hacer pie en un mundo al revés
Busco algún buen amigo
Para que no me atrape algún día
Temiendo hallarla muerta
A la vida

He could be a killer or a blind man with a cane
Perhaps he died in a car crash years ago

I almost thought I saw him, standing, whistling on a bridge
I asked him the time, but when he turned around
I saw it wasn't him at all

I'm still searching

I saw him in an airport while he was sitting on a wing
And I waved to him, but I don't think he noticed me

Six feet beneath the clay

And I bought another bottle of wine and another bottle of gin

When all his herd was in 
He'd never harm a child 
But sing to his mandolin 
He sang the old songs, the old talk 
And the dealin' of our games 
Spanish Johnny seldom spoke 
But sang songs of Spain 
And his talk with men was vicious talk 
When he was drunk on gin 
But those were golden things he said 
To his mandolin 
We had to stand, we had to judge 
We had to stop him then 
See those hands so gentle to a child 
Had killed so many men 
He died a hard death long ago 
Before the roads came in 
And the night before he swung 
He sang to his mandolin 
We carried him out in the morning light 
The man who done no good 
Laid him down in a cold, cold clay 
Stuck in a cross of wood 
And a letter we wrote to his kinfolks 
To tell'em where he'd been 
We shipped it on down to Mexico

Just what it means to lose control

But I took all the heartache
And turned it into shame
Now I'm moving, moving on
And I ain't taking the blame

Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man

So I can say it to you, babe
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
A fool for your loving no more
I'm so tired of trying
I always end up crying
A fool for your loving no more
I'll be a fool for your loving no more

I'm tired of hiding my feelings
You left me lonely too long
I gave my heart and you tore it apart
Oh baby, you done me wrong

Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man

So I can say it to you baby
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
I'm so tired of trying
I always end up crying
A fool for your loving no more
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
I'll be a fool for your loving no more, no more, no more

So I can say it to you baby
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
I'm so tired of trying
I always end up crying
Fool for your loving no more
A fool for your loving no more
No more, no more

Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more

A fool for your loving no more"

With different faces and different names
They all seem different but they're all the same

What does it take to get to you? [2x]

Un giorno che avevo rotto col passato 
Quando già credevo di esserci riuscito 
Son caduto. 
La causa è sciocca un volgare doppio senso 
Mi ha allarmato non è come io la penso 
Ma il sentimento era già un po' troppo denso 
E son restato 

Chissà, chissà chi sei chissà che sarai 
Chissà che sarà di noi

Comunque adesso ho un po' paura 
Ora che quest'avventura 
Sta diventando una storia seria 
Spero tanto tu sia sincera! 

Un magazzino che contiene tante casse 
Alcune nere alcune gialle alcune rosse 
Dovendo scegliere e studiare le mie mosse 
Sono alle impasse 
Mi sto accorgendo che son giunto dentro casa 
Con la mia cassa ancora con il nastro rosa 
E non vorrei aver sbagliato la mia spesa 
O la mia sposa.

96,Jeff Wayne,Forever Autumn,TRNRFPC128F42599E9,1980,"Journalist: For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky,
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them,
Now you're not here

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year,
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Journalist: Fire suddenly leapt from house to house, the population panicked and ran and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally I headed eastward for the ocean, and my only hope of survival: A boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes,
As if to hide a lonely tear,
My life will be forever autumn,

'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Journalist: As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling and streaked with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulder with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horses' bits were covered with foam... and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest. We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper - Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge... One appeared above Big Ben.

Martians: Ulla!

Journalist: Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people, unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.

A vast crowd buffeted me toward the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board - straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie! At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year,
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Martians: Ulla!

Journalist: The steamer began to move slowly away  but on the landward horizon appeared the silhouette of a fighting machine. Another came, and another, striding over hills and plunging far out to sea and blocking the exit of the steamer. Between them lay the silent, grey Ironclad ""Thunder Child"". Slowly it moved towards shore; then, with a deafening roar and whoosh of spray, it swung about and drove at full speed towards the waiting Martians."

100,The Charlie Daniels Band,Carolina (I Remember You),TRNCZIU128F42660C7,1980,"The first things I remember are frosty Carolina mornings with a cheery fire 
crackling in my mommas big black wood cook stove. 

I remember snow flakes as big as goose feathers and the moon the color of new made country butter and a night sky like diamonds against black velvet reaching from horizon to horizon. 

I remember when the biggest problems in my barefoot life were sand spurs and 
red ant hills. 

I remember sitting with my grand-daddy on the front porch and watching the last of that magnificent southern sun bleed away into the twilight sky. 

I remember Sunday school and kneeling at the cross and trying to imagine what God looked like; Sunday dinner, short pants, hair cuts and a little puppy my daddy brought home to me and I remember love. 

I remember steam puffing, fire breathing, awesome 10 wheel locomotives and the conductor's watch looked as big as one of my grandmothers biscuits. 

I remember my mother smiling in a red and white checkered dress and Christmas always seemed so far away. Yes, I remember you Carolina, grand old lady of the south. I remember you as home.

One of the memories that stays on my mind about an old southern lady that I left behind, is a ramshackle bridge where the deep river winds and an old two-lane blacktop through the tall long-leaf pines.

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget.

I still remember the magnolia nights and goosefeather snow flakes in the gray morning light; sandspurs and puppies and red autumn leaves and the warm lights in the clear night on a cold Christmas Eve.

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget.

Carolina I knew you before the highways got to you and I loved you as one of your own and I still do

Carolina, Carolina
You're hard, but you're hard to forget

Your daddy don't mind at all if I come around

As long as I don't stay all night

Your mother Mary's giving me the eye ball

She doesn't know if you'd be alright

Said they were taking a trip, going south for a bit

Gonna see whatever sights they can see

So good-bye now, have a real good holiday

Kiss them once and pocket the keys

Said go on, go on, Go Away

Have a good time but won't you Go Away

When it's late at night you signal with the porch light

That's a green light to me

Then we head up to your lovely little bedroom

Anticipating what there will be

There's parasols and your baby dolls

Undo me honey babe I can't wait

But there's a car coming this way it's pulling in the driveway

Your folks are home hope I can escape

Screaming get off, get out, Go Away

Call me tomorrow but won't you Go Away"

Calling my name

I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees

The result was a baby
Who wanted it all
Moved out of the doll's house
Moved out of the hall

With one wing on the town and a gleam in an eye of red
Said ""My father was a crow, now I want all fathers dead
Find the fathers of this world, treat them as a fatal foe
Put them in the deepest hole, then cover the pit with snow""

With one wing on the town
And a gleam in an eye of red

I'm just trying to tell you what you'll come up against
If you venture from my side, If you think you're so mature
You will end up in a field, you will be someone's manure
Mushrooms growing from your back
Feeding some damn carrion bird
Do you want to contribute
To the corruption of the world?

With one wing on the town
And a gleam in an eye of red

A crow and a baby
Had an affair
My dream was the baby
The crow was your hair
Parts of me love parts of you
That at least is obvious
Give my baby back to me

I had to write this letter
To tell you how I came to meet her
She was sweet but I dated her sister
That's how I made my mistake
And I can't forget her
I felt depressed
Till a friend of mine suggested
That I write to this address
So unless you can find a cure
For my loneliness
It will persist, it will persist

Lonely boy
Looking for another
Lonely girl
To love one another
Lonely hearts
Turn to each other

Dear Lonely Boy
I doubt if my reply
Will bring much joy
It seems from your letter that you lied
Or strongly implied
That you were satisfied
To take her sister by your side
I became distressed
At your total lack of tactfulness
So at best
All I can suggest
Is that you resist
And you put an end
To such thoughts of silliness

Lonely boy
Looking for another

To love one another
Lonely hearts
Turn to each other

Dear Miss Lonely Hearts
I've got problems
You're the only one I know that can solve them
I love a girl but I'm dating her sister
And if I persist in my pursuit I will kiss her

Dear Lonely Girl
I doubt if this reply will bring much joy
But you must not trust this boy
You must not lust this boy
Resist
And do not kiss this boy

Looking for another

To love one another

Turn to each other

Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting

A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until

The feeling has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool, empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance

The image has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me

Moss turf, and other lads

Or take a plane to Spain

Refrigerator's noise

Should I get up right now 
Wait for me somehow 
Don't wanna know what for 
To get out of this door 
Should I phone Debbie Meier? 
Is this the one desire?

there's no turning back
To white city lights.

Here in this cage it gets harder to relate
What did I do, to change me this way
Oh yes I remember I can just see your face
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you.

(Guitar Solo)

A hero or villain, is what you become
Or take the road in-between
As free as a bird or a man on the run
Well it could have been me
When other lights shine and then leave me in the dark
You're always there your happy from the start
But where still separated and it's breaking my heart
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you."

Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, again

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of light

Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell

Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

Neon Knights
Neon Knights
All right

Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights

133,The Clash,Something About England,TRYOPXW128F4259EAD,1980,"They say immigrants steal the hubcaps
of the respected gentlemen
they say it would be wine and roses
if England were for Englishmen again

Well I saw a dirty overcoat
at the foot of the pillar of the road
propped inside was an old man
whom time would not erode
when the night was snapped by sirens
those blue lights circled past
the dancehall called for an ambulance
the bars all closed up fast

My silence gazing at the ceiling
while roaming the single room
I thought the old man could help me
if he could explain the gloom
you really think it's all new?
you really think about it too?
the old man scoffed as he spoke to me
I'll tell you a thing or two

I missed the fourteen-eighteen war
but not the sorrow afterwards
with my father dead and my mother ran off
my brothers took the pay of hoods
the twenties turned the north was dead
the hunger strike came marching south
at the garden party not a word was said
the ladies lifted cake to their mouths

The next war began and my ship sailed
with battle orders writ in red
in five long years of bullets and shells
we left ten million dead
the few returned to old Piccadilly
we limped around Leicester Square
the world was busy rebuilding itself
the architects could not care

But how could we know when I was young
all the changes that were to come?
all the photos in the wallets on the battlefield
and now the terror of the scientific sun
there was master and servants and servants and dogs
they taught you how to touch your cap
but throught strikes and famine and war and peace
England never closed this gap

So leave me now the moon is up
but remember all the tales I tell
the memories that you have dredged up
are on letters forwarded from hell

The streets were now deserted
the gangs had trudged off home
the lights clicked off in the bedsits
and old England was all alone"

Between my love and I;
And it's down in yon green valley
I'll meet her by and by.

It was down in yon green valley
She is my heart's delight:
""Molly, lovely Molly,
I will stay till broad daylight.""

Going to church last Sunday,
My true love she passed me by.
I knew her mind was altered
By the roving of her eye.

Well I knew her mind was altered
To a lad of high degree:
""Molly, lovely Molly,
Your looks have wounded me.""

Up came her love Willy
With a bottle in his hand,
Saying, ""Drink this, lovely Molly,
For our love will never stand.""

Saying, ""Drink this, lovely Molly,
Let the bottle flask go free.
Ten guineas I'll wager,
That married we ne'er shall be.""

Never marry a fair young maid
With a dark and a roving eye.
Just you kiss her and you embrace her,
Never tell her the reason why.

Just you kiss her and you embrace her
Till you cause her heart to yield;
For a faint-hearted soldier
Will never gain the field.

Farewell, Ballymonie,
Likewise the sweet Bann shore.
Farewell unto McCusky braes,
Will I never see more.

America lies far away,
That land I will go see;
And may all bad luck attend the one
Who parted my love and me."

When it's gone do you know what it means

Can you picture the time when a man had to find
His own way through the cold
To come back again to all that you've been
Can't you see that it's time to come home

To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees
And the earth who's the mother of all
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade
Will we rise with the vision or fall

Milioni di discorsi non parlati, aborti mai usciti dal cervello
Nel sangue sparso dall'Inquisizione, nelle morali assurde del potere
Nella necessità della ragione, nel tormentato viaggio del sapere

Si nutrono le piante di chi è stanco di aspettare
E il sole della rabbia prima o poi porta quei fiori allo sbocciare
E inoltre le visioni dei poeti molto al di là del muro dei valori
Nel magma arroventato dei pianeti, sopra la cecità di miti e umori
Nel centro degli stomaci affamati, nel cuore dei bisogni delle vele
In fondo a sacrifici innominati, laddove odio e amore stanno insieme

Si nutrono le piante di chi è stanco di aspettare
E il sole della rabbia prima o poi porta quei fiori allo sbocciare
Tra i ruderi di Atlantide sommersa, nei corpi martoriati degli schiavi
Nel sogno di una nuova alba diversa, nei grandi esploratori senza navi
Tra i cantici potenti dell'ingegno e il misero strisciare dell'inganno
Tra mistiche figure senza regno che corrono e non sanno dove vanno

Si nutrono le piante di chi è stanco di aspettare

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn’t really know, doesn’t really know

Away from this long lonely nights
I’m reaching for you, are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh, so right?

And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There’s no easy way, it gets harder each day

Barking at my mind
Shoving me to wine

But if you choose to stay
You end up playing anyway
It's okay-

The kids in shock up and down the block
The folks are home playing beat the clock
Down at the golden cup
They set the young ones up
Under the neon light
Selling day for night
It's alright-

Nobody rides for free
Nobody gets it like they want it to be
Nobody hand you any guarantee
Nobody

The hearts are hard and the times are tough
Down on the boulevard the night's enough
And time passes slow
Between the store front shadows and the street lights glow

Everybody walks right by like they're safe or something
They don't know-

Nobody knows you
Nobody owes you nothin
Nobody shows you what they're thinking
Nobody baby

You got to watch the street, keep your feet
And be on guard
Make it pay baby
It's only time on the boulevard"

Just pure motor reflex is keeping me going

You can tease your little puppy mama, that's alright
But when they grow up they just love to fight
You tremble in the dark when you hear that sound

Believe me that's no fun. 

I'm Jake the peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With my extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um,
Wherever I go through rain and snow,
The people always let me know:
There's Jake the Peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With his extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um. 

I had a dreadful childhood, really,
I s'pose I shouldn't moan,
Each time they had a three legged race,
I won it on my own.
And also I got popular,
When came the time for cricket,
They used to roll my trousers up,
And use me for the wicket. 

I'm jake the peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With my extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um.
Wherever I go through rain and snow,
The people always let me know:
There's Jake the Peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With his extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um. 

I was a dreadful scholar,
I found all the lessons hard,
The only thing I knew for sure was three feet make a yard.
To count to ten I used my fingers,
If I needed more,
By getting my shoes and socks of,
I could count to twenty-four.
(Pause...count: 1 2 3 4 5....) To twenty-five! 

I'm jake the peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With my extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um.
Whatever I did they said was false,
They said 'Quick march,' I did a quick waltz.
Then they shouted at me 'Put your best foot forward.' 
'But which foot?' I said.
'It's very fine for you, you only got a choice of two, but me! 

I'm jake the peg, deedle eedle eedle um,
With my extra leg, deedle eedle eedle um."

She sings the blues
She says abracadabra when she goes down on you

She got a sister and her name is Anita
Anita got one peculiar feature
Every time that they come to meet her
She turns out like a jungle cheetah
She got spiked shoes
She hums the blues
She says razor when she goes down on you

There's another one that makes a trio
Her name is Sally but they call her Cleo
She's a Leo
She got a flat in Soho
She breaks the ceiling
Every time she twirls her mojo
She ain't got no shoes
Never had the blues

They make it their career
In the single files of history
Fall and disappear
Swearing they'll get even
With all those other creeps
Philistines and Heathens
They violently sleep
Or steal from cigarette machines
Just for the change
To get back to where they've been
A doorway in the rain
Back in the confession box
Back in the slums
Desire burns like chicken pox
Underneath the thumbs
A refugee from purgatory
Wears a crown of thorns
Turns out she's a gringo
Of hard circumstance

They want to see you dance
Take the tradesman's entrance
Take it out on a tramp
Every fucking sentence
Complains about the damp
The only girl is a faint cry
In the garden of cement
Wait until the paint dries
It's a big event
Look through heaven's window
With their opalescent panes
Limbo Baby Limbo

Down the Boulevard of shame
Saint Margaret dies intact
Hardly seems alert
Her stone gaze denies the fact
Her face hurts
The extra legal image
The cold cream skin
The regal gimicks
Did you in
Look through heaven's window
You see the powder blue veil
The cover girl of limbo

The sweetheart of the jail
Gypsy babies hop-scotch
Outside the silver gates
The witch doctor's wristwatch
Is stuck at five-to-eight
A bad break, a slight ache
Is every ones compaint
Flesh flakes like angel cake
From mug-shots of the saints
Who fell from a window
Was never seen again
'Til he turns up in limbo

In a doorway in the rain
A hero rides to heaven
The public only rots
For a fraction of forever
In a designated spot
Eternally paralysed
A morbid orbit shift
Halfway to paradise
Stuck in the lifts
Some smart crackin' bimbo
Say's you can't be employed
Sends you off to limbo
On the stairway to a void"

It hasn't moved this slow
Since the virgins, since the virgins went dancing for the rain

You know the stars in the night
They're like the holes in the cave
Like the ceiling of a bombed-out church
But gravity blocks my screams
It's like an enemy's dreams
My guardians quit
They quit before they started their search

I want a world without gravity
It could be just what I need
I'd watch the stars move close
I'd watch the earth recede

I wanna drift above the borders against my will
I wanna sleep where the angels don't pass
But now my lips are blue
Gravity does it to you
It's like they're pressed against a mirrored glass

I want my will and capability to meet inside the region
Where this gravity don't mean a thing
It's where the angels break through . . .
It's where they bring it to you
It's where silence, silence can teach me to sing

I want a world without gravity
It could be just what I need
I'd watch the stars move close
I'd watch the earth recede

I want a world without gravity
It could be just what I need
I'd watch the stars move close
I'd watch the earth recede

I wanna lay beneath these sheets and never turn blue
I wanna hold you, hold you tight but never touch
I want some pure, pure white; hey, we can nod all night
We can do it without thinking too much

I want the dilettantes and parvenues to choke on my wrists
They think the pearls I wear are pills
I want their gravity to shatter . . . but it really doesn't matter
I got something in my eye that kills!

I want a world without gravity

Love was in her heart
But I had dreams to find before I could see
I asked her if she'd wait for me
But I was gone too long
Tears were in her eyes
She said I took our love and threw it away
And nothin' I could do or say
Could bring it back again
 
I was tryin' to be somethin' more
Than the man I had come to be
I never meant to leave her sad and lonely
If only she could see
 
I did it all for love
All for love
'Cause nothin' really matters if it's strong enough
All for love

No, nothin' really matters if you've got enough
 
She walked out that door
And all my dreams went with her into the night

Could ever slip away

But I had dreams to find before I could see
That somewhere deep inside of me

187,Kurtis Blow,Way Out West,TRRAESW128E0785EA4,1980,"Way Out West from way back east
Coming from a place you'd expect the least
There came a stranger, dressed in black
From a Harlem Town, a long way back

Had a Stetson hat with a band of gold
Eyes like steel, make your blood run cold
Had a microphone hanging by his side
Just ready to be amplified

Rode into town on a big black steed
Lookin' for a man named Ganamede
""I hear the dude just won't get down
If I rock this world I can rock this town!""

And when they asked him for his name
He said ""Kurtis Blow, I play the rappin' game
I can do the do, I can do the deed
And tonight I'm gonna rock Ganamede!""

Now Ganamede thought he was cool
Wore Gucci shoes, had a fancy school
A fancy job in a big corporation
Fancy girls all across the nation

Fancy car, fancy clothes, 
Fancy friends and fancy dough
Only one thing he wouldn't do
Is let himself get down with you

The stranger went to the old saloon
Grabbed his mike and spun a tune
And everyone in the whole darn place
Said ""Do the rap and set that pace!""

He rapped 'em down and he rapped 'em out
He made 'em dance and he made 'em shout
He said ""If you like Kurtis Blow
Then let me hear you all say...

A say ho-oo! Ho-oo!
Hi-yo! Hi-yo!
Say Kurtis! Kurtis!
Say Kurtis Blow! Kurtis Blow!

At midnight Ganamede came in
To watch the dancers move and spin
He took a seat over by the bar
And started smokin' a big cigar

""I admit the stranger is not bad
But tonight I'm gonna make him sad
'Cause I don't care about the groove
There ain't no dude gonna make me move!""

The joint was jumpin' hard at one
But Ganamede was havin' none
Things were really fly at two
The stranger rapped and the tension grew

But Ganamede maintained his cool
""I'll make the stranger play the fool
'Cause I don't care about the groove
There ain't no dude gonna make me move!""

The showdown came at three o'clock
The stranger said, ""I'm gonna make you rock
I'm gonna make you move, I'm gonna make you dance,
They're gonna take you out in an ambulance

Now everybody lend a hand
I'm gonna make you be the band
There ain't no jive, no superstition
We're gonna have a little demolition
Get down!

Now stomp your feet
To the funky beat
Just clap your hands
And let the beat expand
Let me here the bass
Put it in my face
Let the guitar play
Just put it away
And now I think we've got the groove
So Ganamede, get up and move!""

Now everyone looked at the bar
At the lonely man with the big cigar
He began to move, he began to shake
He'd had as much as he could take

He took his body to the floor
And then the crowd began to roar
The stranger just had done the deed
And rocked the house with Ganamede.

From three to four he couldn't stop
From four to five he just had to rock
From five to six he let it loose
At seven he still had the juice

At eight o'clock he was goin' strong
Gettin' down with every song
At nine o'clock he couldn't dance
And someone called an ambulance

As they put him in the back
Of that big white shiny Cadillac
He said ""Please get me Kurtis Blow
There's something that he ought to know""

He said ""I thought I'd make my name
By beatin' you at the rappin' game
But you beat me fair and square
And anyway, I just don't care.""

The stranger asked him what he meant
Said Ganamede, ""I am content
I never used to catch a groove
I never used to dance or move

But it's more fun to play the fool
Than tryin' hard to be real cool
So anytime you're back in town
I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna get down!""

The stranger watched him drive away
Knowing what he'd done that day
And then he went right back inside
To make the dancers slip and slide

To rock 'em out, to rock 'em in,
To make 'em rock it down again
And he said ""If you like my sound
Let me hear you all say...

Throw down! Throw down!
At the showdown! At the showdown!
Throw down! Throw down!
At the showdown! At the showdown!

Now stomp your feet
To the funky beat
Just clap your hands
And let the beat expand
Let me here the bass
Put it in my face
Let the guitar play
Just put it away
A-rock on!"

The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull.

Out on the floor where the cowboys dance
Approaching slowly at a glance
Here comes the shadow of his stance
The reins are fallin' from his hands.

Why do you ride that crazy horse?
Inquires the shadow with little remorse
Just then a priest comes down the stairs
With a sack of dreams and old nightmares.

Who are you, the rider says
You dress in black but you talk like a Fed
You spout ideas from books that you read
Don't you care about this guy's head?

Just then the sound of hoofbeats was heard
And the sky was darkened by a prehistoric bird
Who flew between the unfulfilled moon
And the naked rider, to a telephone booth.

We'll call the moon and see what's up
I've got some change in this little tin cup
We'll say that the shadow is growin' dim
And we need some light to get back to him
Just one call should do it all
I'll carve this number on the wall
With my beak.

Flying feathers were all around
The air was filled with a ringing sound.
Two more birds, the second and the third
Came down from the sky to deliver the word.

Where have you been, they said to the first
Get back to the clouds, we're dying of thirst
There's not enough time to make that call
Let's ditch this rider, shadow and all.

The sky was filled with the beautiful birds
Still on the ground some crying was heard
With his dime in his hand and his hand on the dial
His ears were sweating as he forced a smile.

Hoofbeats beating across the range
He rode through the night with his cup of change
Tired and beaten he fell into slumber
But up in the sky they still had his number.

Up and down the old homestead
The naked rider gallops through his head
And although the moon isn't full
He still feels the pull,
Still feels the pull."

No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger no
'Cos I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you

I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her
Love her love her love her

Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change? What did I say?
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me

Ooh I need your loving tonight

No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
Can't be no warning how could I guess?
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

di tutti i miei nemici

ha preso la mia mano 
l'ha data in pasto a quel

Ci esercitiamo a scuola a far la faccia dura 
per fare pi� paura Ma cosa c'� di male? 
Ma cosa c'� di strano? Facciamo un gran casino 
ma in fondo lavoriamo per Cpitan Uncino 

Io sono il professore della rivoluzione 
della pirateria io sono la teoria 
il faro illuminante 

Ma lo capite o no? Ve lo rispiegher� 
per scuotere la gente, non bastano i discorsi 
ci vogliono le bombe 

Io ero un benestante, non mi mancava niente

Walk slowly to the door
Go into town hoping to score
Did she find her a man who said he'd give her all he can
And when that's not enough then life starts to get tough
Who will care? Who will care?

Did she die in the cold
Was she scared to be old
Nobody knows where and old loner goes

And on one grey day some children at play
Saw her dead body, thought it was funny
Oh look at that lady on the ground fast asleep

Punks and skunks and kooks and geeks

Is in a mess
But they can't talk
The way they dress

See the knee through the hole in their jeans
A hole in their pocket and it looks so mean
Hole in the T-Shirt, what's that you said?
You're about as clever as a hole in the head

Can't get no jobs
Can't get careers
With safety pins
Stuck through their ears

Cut your hair, dye it green
See it shine, with Brylcreem
A little dab'll do ya, a little dab a day
Or rub-a-dub it in a dreadlocks way

They'll all be beating bongo drums

Dropped out of kindergarten
Dropped out of school
Really hot on my bongo drums
Really hot on my bongo drums

So who'll defend
In World War III
Where could we turn
Where would they be

Tell her!

Down in the cellar, filled with smoke
Laughing at the latest joke
Doing the latest dance to do
The Fug and the Shimmy and the Suzie Q

Lay the tasks and pay the price
Everything suffice
Crashed and bolted all we craved

Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage"

Jag fråga vart?

Och vi träffa ett gäng med bågar och brass

Såg färjan öster ut i toner av mar

Iväg och slänger hit och dit och man öppnar den å fyller med

e adesso sei il nemico e così sia
Credo che in certi momenti il cervello non sa più pensare
e corre in rifugi da pazzi e non vuole tornare
poi cado coi piedi per terra e scoppiano folgore e tuono
non credo alla vita pacifica non credo al perdono
Adesso quando i medici di turno rifiuteranno di esserti d'aiuto
perchè venne un polacco ad insegnargli
che è più cristiano imporsi col rifiuto
pretenderanno che tu torni indietro
e ti costringeranno a partorire
per poi chiamarlo figlio della colpa
e tu una Maddalena da pentire
Credo che in certi momenti il cervello non sa più pensare
e corre in rifugi da pazzi e non vuole tornare
poi cado coi piedi per terra e scoppiano folgore e tuono
non credo alla vita pacifica non credo al perdono
Volevo dedicarti quattro righe per quanto può valere una canzone
credo che tu abbia fatto qualche cosa anche se questa è solo un'opinione
che lascerà il tuo segno nella vita e i poveri bigotti reazionari
dovranno fare senza peccatrici saranno senza scopi umanitari

I can handle the glamour, I can cope with the stress  
Deal with the doughnuts and please all the rest  
I'm polite to the punters and sweet to the press

I'm leaving my bat and my balls to the nation  

I've got megalomania I've got megalomania  
To be a twinkle in the show-biz dream  
To which effect I could canive and scheme  
I dive into the dairy and I lap up all the cream  
I'm up to the armpits in self-esteem  

Stiff me quietly up the charts  
Then I can go public with my private parts  

And here is me, oh look at me

And I know when the feeling hits you,
It's gonna hit you;
Yes I know where it's gonna hit you;
Right there in the back of your mind.
And I Know when the feeling hits you,
I'll never quit you;
Yes, you know that I'll never quit you;
Got too much on the line,
La la la la la la la.
You got to hold on, hold on, baby;
Hold on, hold on, baby;
Got to hold on, hold on baby . . . . ."

expensive and mean
no nutritional values have I
you may have me
once in a while
I will make you smile

You are a fifty pound bag of soybeans 
more than a bargain to me
you take hours to cook
you have serious taste
you make me sob

I am a poison and I am fun
illegal lightweight luxury
you are the law the long hard road
grave inevitable destiny

This is story of the boat family
came over here from the Red China Sea
moved into the sovereign state of Suffern
when they got their picture taken they were laughin'"

He's sure to go to heaven
Always spotless, clean and neat
As smooth as you'll get 'em

He's got a fur lined sheepskin jacket
My ma said they cost a packet
But she won't even let me explain
That me and Kevin we're just not the same

Oh, my perfect cousin
What I like to do he doesn't
He's his family's pride and joy
His mother's little golden boy

He's got a degree in economics
Maths, physics and bionics
He thinks that I'm a cabbage
'Cause I hate University Challenge

Even at the age of ten
Smart boy Kevin was a smart boy then
He always beat me at Subbuteo
'Cause he ""flicked to kick""
And I didn't know

Oh, my perfect cousin
What I like to do he doesn't
He's his family's pride and joy
His mother's little golden boy

His mother bought him a synthesiser
Got the Human League into advise her
Now he's making lots of noise
Playing along with the art school boys

Girls try to attract his attention
But what a shame, it's in vain, total rejection
He will never be left on the shelf
'Cause Kevin, he's in love with himself

Oh, my perfect cousin
What I like to do he doesn't
He's his family's pride and joy
His mother's little golden boy"

Enough to drive a man to drink, I don't do no washing up
I always reached the stuff piled up, piled up in the sink

But you will always find him in the kitchen at parties

Me and my girlfriend we argued and she ran away from home
She must have found somebody new and now I'm all alone
Living on my own, what am I supposed to do?

That's why you'll always find him in the kitchen at parties
You will always find him in the kitchen at parties
You will always find him in the kitchen at parties

Then I met this debutante, I said that I like new wave rock
She was into French cuisine but I ain't no Cordon Bleu
This was at some do in palmer's green, I had no luck with her

You will still find him in the kitchen at parties
You will still find him in the kitchen at parties

At last I met a pretty girl, she laughed and talked with me
We both walked out of the kitchen and danced in a new way

And now I've done my time in the kitchen at parties
I've done my time in the kitchen at parties

He's done his time in the kitchen at parties
He's done his time in the kitchen at parties
He's done his time in the kitchen at parties

You heard about Suzi from Baton Rouge?
You have? Well
Let me tell you about her!
Yeh ! Well little Suzi was raised at the Baton Rouge
Suzi was fooled
She was born to lose
She could be seen keeping company wherever she went
With those long haired blue eyed southern gents.

She said I may be too young to fall in love
But I'm still hangin' round
She said I may be too young to fall in love
But I'm still hangin' round.
Just waiting for you
I'm just awaitin' for you
She said I'm waitin' for you
You
I'm just waitin' for you.

Well you know what those Louisiana nights can do
To a back street girl with southern blues
Fifteen have passed and straight out of school
She was hard to handle
She was easy to fool
They said go go go little Suzi
Too old to scold and too young to choose
Suzi was fooled
Born to lose
And that's how they talk about her down in Baton Rouge.

She said I may be too young to fall in love ..."
240,Phil Lynott,Talk In '79,TRCEOJY128F145AC42,1980,"The Clash were headed for a head on collision
Crash for complete control
The Pistols left behind a swindle and a scandal
That nobody wished to handle
Sham 69 were left in a shambles
Generation X was next

Elvis and Nick Lowe
They had a go
With the help of the Attractions
And Joe Jackson said it wasn't his style
Dave Edmunds survived alive
On top of a Rockpile
Devo didn't know if they were men
Because they couldn't get no satisfaction
The Rats were caught in their own trap
Steve Strange began to change
Ultravox had a system
Kraftwerk nearly beat them
And the Yellow Magic Orchestra missed them
Eno rose for Lowe

The Slits became rasta
And the Buzzcocks played faster and faster with adrenalin
John Cooper Clarke he was smart
The Public Image became Limited
The Police were re-released and came out as a three-piece

The Rocky Horror Show became the history of tomorrow
Nina Hagen, she was a German maiden
And the music press revealed their anger
When threatened by the Stranglers

This broadcast was brought to you in 1979
I'm just talking to you over these waves
Not just about another time and another place
And before we knew it
The old wave was gone and controlled"

Somewhere exciting
White lies and amber lighting
Try to seduce me

Was I really so unkind

To lie right back and turn the radio on

Middle market leisure wear,
But don't let him be your teddy bear...
Could be 'It Man' ...baby

You want women, wall-to-wall
'It Man' got.
Meet the man who started it all,
'It Man' got.

What's it to to be then John?
A brunetto, or a bleeding blonde?
The tell-tale tongue of a two-ton taste bomb,
Is the kiddy coming on?
Like the 'It Man' baby.

Take the sugar. Dump the crumbs.
It's a mugs game.
Take some bugger for a lump sum,
And bugger off to Spain.

An endless stream of fizzy drinks for 'It Man.'
Who's dentures gleam like sovereign cuff-links,
'It Man' baby

Who drove the van?
Some all purpose also ran.
When the shit hits the fan,
Who's gonna carry the can?
For 'It-man.'

He's after all your stuff
His motto is... 'receive.'
Too much is not enough now,
Let's not be naive

Drip-dry, zip-fly, 'It Man.'
Kiss the girls and make them die, 'It Man' baby
Underneath that yellow shirt,
Beats a heart of solid dirt
The most disgusting man on earth, 'It Man' baby.

No back chat was ever written
For It Man's 'tart.'
The cute cat or the stiff kitten,
'It Man' took her apart.
He shook away the poison pen,
Next thing... 'News-at-Ten.'

Ladies and Gentlemen... 'It Man'

Well well, bloody hell, 'It Man.'
Checking you out and ringing your bell,
You better quit man.

He's walking around, taking names
Looking for money in the burnt remains,
All stories finish in flames for 'It Man.'

In his long ago
Sentimental fools don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created 
Once in their lives

She musters a smile
For a nostalgic tale
Never comin' near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice

As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes
He sees
No wise man has the power 
To reason away
What seems 
To be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all

Is sending him somewhere back
In his long ago
Where he can still believe
There's a place in his life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice

As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes
(I know she's never going away)
He sees
No wise man has the power
(Ain't nobody got it) 
To reason away
What seems
(Nobody's gonna tell him)
To be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all

He's making a fool believe

Now I'm wonderin' why

When you tell me your mine
You send a shiver runnin' up and down my spine
Could this be love
'Cause you're the girl I've been dreamin' of now

I'm wonderin' why

When I look in your eyes

Du vrai amour qui rend malheureux,

Invite the Germans home for tea
Let them mock and let them sneer

The emancipation that's sweeping the nation
When it seemed the world was sunk
You can bet your boots on your own pursuits
History is bunk
From Rosemary Clooney to Jerry Lee Lewis
From Debussy to Thelonius Monk
It's the modern art of the human heart
The shape of things to funk, funk, funk

Let's see you do it, you always knew  it
It's totally impossible to misconstrue it
In sight of the fact and in spite of the fashion
Living is a lap-top animated fashion
Pay no attention to the bones of contention
Do the new-age boogie for the old-age pension
Let them stop and let them snore
We'll be glad that  we were born

Motivation is the new  sensation
The fantasy that keeps you fit
On the human assumption, you don't have the gumption
Get up and do your bit
Being daft is a therapy craft
Which sharpens up your wits
Totally enthusic about the music
and  it shows in the face you sit, sit, sit

Oh, let's get up and let's get excited

Sing it and the sun will shine for you
Sing a song of love
It's a song that bring your dreams come true

Play it like you feel
It will never let you down, my friend
Sing a song of love
Yes, it will help you, when it comes right from your heart

Sing a song of love
Rhythm by the music of the sea
Sing a song of love
Sing it and forever you'll be free

Play it like you feel
I can hear the music in the air
Sing a song of love
Yes, it will help you, when it comes right from your heart

Can you hear the mandolines?
The music softly playing in the wind
It is just a simple song
It's made for us so we can sing along

Sing a song of love
Sing it and the sun will shine for you
Sing a song of love
It's a song that bring your dreams come true

Play it like you feel
It will never let you down, my friend
Sing a song of love
Yes, it will help you, when it comes right from your heart

I saw the chaos on the other side
The leap from far below your only guide

Don't be distracted from the act of will
Don't be distracted from the act of will

The stars are brighter than a factory site
The paper frantic with Fahrenheit

We see the world though a plastic screen
We never dreamed it was where we'd be
Momentum problem of a piece of dust
One never knew it was a two-way bridge

Don't be distracted from the act of will
Don't be distracted from the act of will

The lurking fear is what you attract
Like a turkey in a frozen pack
Your place is firm when you can react

with a little nightlife - nightlife
 
You leave the club at three a.m. to find a bar
and breath the air
and something moves in the dark - a drunk -
just lying there
so you take a taxi to the part of town
where lights still shine
and girls on street corners
try to take you to some hotel room
to have a good time
ooh and you know that you'll be satisfied
with a little nightlife - nightlife
 
So you're looking for love in a strange town
and all the clubs and bars just let you down
so you haggle the price with some lady of the night
and when you're finally satisfied that there's nowhere left to go
you go back to your hotel room
and lie there in the dawn alone
to sleep

Pongamos que hablo de Madrid.

Donde el deseo viaja en ascensores
un agujero queda para mí,
que me dejo la vida en sus rincones...

Las niñas ya no quieren ser princesas
y a los niños les da por perseguier el mar
dentro de un vaso de ginebra...

Los pájaros visitan al psiquiatra,
las estrellas se olvidan de salir,
la muerte pasa en ambulancias blancas...

El sol es una estufa de butano,
la vida un metro a punto de partir,
hay una jeringa en el lavabo...

Cuando la muerte venga a visitarme 
no me despiertes, déjame dormir.
Aquí he vivido, aquí quiero quedarme."

Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin

People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation, would make a better society

Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say

And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin

I said, now people must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation, would make a better society

And if you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose my brothers"

Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I wasn't sleeping, what's at stake?

A day without me.

Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?

A day without me.

Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
They shed a tear and on they go."
285,Bow Wow Wow,Louis Quatorze,TRHKUNT128F92E1B38,1980,"When he comes bursting thru that door, mama leaps and hits the floor
Calling himself Louis Quatorze, he's so young and dangerous

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back, ""Honey, close your eyes and think of England""
Just one second
It's his genuine act, as a matter of fact, Louis was horrible to me
He tears down my defenses, he pretends that I'm against him

Chorus:
Come back again, don't tell me when, Louis Quatorze, always surprise me

Louis, Louis, Louis did love me, Louis Quatorze made love to me

Fourteen's how I'll ever be, I don't know how long it lasts
But one thing's for sure, Louis Quatorze must hurry to love me

And more and more and more and more, Louis Quatorze loves me some more


Louis, Louis's locking my door, Louis's serious, I'm delirious
He loves me just 'cos he's so ware, Louis's gonna shoot me
No plays, he just doesn't care, Louis Quatorze starts to undress me

You just don't mess with Louis Quatorze
With his gun in my back, I start to undress
He's my partner in this crime of happiness, 'cos I'm just fourteen

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back, ""Honey, make love to me""
chorus repeats 2x

Louis Quatorze, I love you

Bruised and mangled, scourged and torn
By thy passion, kiss divine
Fill my heart and make it thine

Purest victim, stainless priest
Thou the host and thou the feast
By the pains thou didst endure
Cleanse my soul and make it pure

Oh, thou, who camest from above
Kindle a flame of sacred love
Alleluya, Deus
Fons amoris, spiritus

Thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips.  My heart is inditing of a good matter, I speak of the things which I have made unto the King: my tongue is the pen.

Song of joy, eternal lay
At your feet I kneel and pray
Blind, I pray that I may see
Bound, I pray to be made free

Loving shepherd of thy sheep
At your feet, prostrate, I weep
Sinful, sighing to be blest
Weary, waiting for my rest

Oh, love, I give myself to thee
Thine ever, only thine to be
Alleluya, Deus
Amor quam ecstaticus

I am risen and am still with thee, thou hast laid thine hand upon me, thou hast searched me out and known me: thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising.

Blessed martyr, holy one
Thou the father, thou the son
What is rigid, gently bend
What is frozen, warmly tend

Lover of the virgin womb
Thou tile sun and thou the moon
What is wounded, work its cure
What is soiled, make thou pure

Oh, master, it is good to be
Thine ever, only thine to see
Alleluya, Deus
Veni, sancte spiritus

Mine eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net: 1ook thou upon me, and have mercy upon me, for I am desolate, afflicted, and in misery."
288,The Pointer Sisters,He's So Shy,TRANPVC12903CD5010,1980,"When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully
And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

Chorus:
He's so shy, he's so shy 
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy 
And he's much too good to let get by
Oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine
He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy(so good lookin'), he's so shy (really got me goin')
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (I'm so glad I got to know him), he's so shy (cuz he's one in a million)
That I'll love him till the day I die
Oh yes I will

He's so shy(that's why I love my baby), he's so shy (you know it's drivin me crazy)
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy (took a long time to know him), he's so shy (and I'm so glad I got to show him)
That I'll love him till the day I die
Oh yes I will

Verbal slang, American twang, you dare not ignore 
In from New York, prompted her to talk of superballs
Judy Teen grew sick of the scene, just bragging to fools

She took us on a carousel
She made us smile and oh, how we laughed
Together riding on a crest it was swell
We stole her face and oh, how we laughed
She made us happy

Sacral blues in various hues, she capered to draw me
Me and Yankie, all hanky panky, seldom she bored me
She's so bold and me feeling old, just stroking her face
Super troubadour, he can show you more than her lace

She took us on a carousel
She made us smile and oh, how we laughed
Together riding on a crest it was swell
We stole her face and oh, how we laughed
She made us happy

Judy Teen, we know where you've been, your ego's insane
To the cabaret where you'd schlep and sway on your cane
Seeking shelter, no helter skelter's gonna betray yer
Judy Teen, the queen of the scene, is coming to slay yer

She took us on a carousel
She made us smile and oh, how we laughed
Together riding on a crest it was swell
We stole her face and oh, how we laughed

Books will burn, people laugh and cry in their turmoil
(Turmoil turns rejoiceful)
Shed your fears and lose your guilt
Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home

And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led
Pissing theirselves laughing (and the flames grew)
Their mad eyes bulged, their flushed faces said
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger 

We feast on flesh and drink on blood
Live by fear and despise love in a crisis
(What with today's high prices)
Bring some paper and bring some wood
Bring what's left of all your love for the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home

And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led
Pissing theirselves laughing (and the flames grew)

The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger

Everybody knows that yeah I'm kind of shy,
I'm not the kind of girl that who can ever approach a guy,
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me,

I got a 4 wheel drive, 55, from eyes
but maybe you can handle these because I'm Free.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.

When I told you that I don't need a man in my life that ties me down,
And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town.
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat,
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me,
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun,
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please.

Last thing I need is a man who's soft,
He better get it on up, and break me off,
Some body fly high, who's 6'5,
who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,

No mental link 
No letting out just what you think 

There is no language in our lungs, lungs, lungs, lungs 

There is no muscle in our tongues 
To tell the world what's in our hearts 
No no no no no we're leaving nothing behind
Just chiselled stones 
No chance to speak before we're bones 

There is no muscle in our tongues, tongues, tongues, tongues

I thought I had the whole world in my mouth 
I thought I could say what I wanted to say 
For a second that thought became a sword in my hand 
I could slay any problem that would stand in my way 

I felt just like a crusader 
Lionheart, a Holy Land invader 
But nobody can say what they really mean to say and 
The impotency of speech came up and hit me that day and 
I would have made this instrumental 
But the words got in the way

your lies and decieving diplomats
can't reach me where i'm hiding at
you'll find you have no powers over me
i'm in a place where no one's been
it's free of greed and all your sin
and weapons that are lying to your mirror
i wanna forget you just the way you are
so i won't be lonely here without you near
(cause i can't afford your tears)
late night high rise blocks of cold
with burgess growing gracefully old
t.v. patterns glow where i must go
dark creaking floorboards changing walls
the corpse sharing sheets that leaves in morn
i'm shaking in the chill of t.o. noon
the silent subway's rubber grin
laughs at the poise 'n arrow change i'm in
you're starting finally drive me sane
the oriental shopkeep waves
from glen road to a better grave
returning to the stance you loved me for"

De Prague à Budapest de Sofia à Moscou
Les staliniens zélés qui mettaient tout en oeuvre
Pour vous faire signer les aveux les plus fous
Vous aviez combattu partout la bête immonde
Des brigades d'Espagne à celles des maquis
Votre jeunesse était l'histoire de ce monde
Vous aviez nom Kostov ou London ou Slansky

Au nom de l'idéal qui nous faisait combattre
Et qui nous pousse encore à nous battre aujourd'hui

Ah ils nous en ont fait applaudir des injures
Des complots déjoués des dénonciations
Des traîtres démasqués des procès sans bavures
Des bagnes mérités des justes pendaisons
Ah comme on y a cru aux déviationnistes
Aux savants décadents aux écrivains espions
Aux sionistes bourgeois aux renégats titistes
Aux calomniateurs de la révolution

Au nom de l'idéal qui nous faisait combattre
Et qui nous pousse encore à nous battre aujourd'hui

Ah ils nous en ont fait approuver des massacres
Que certains continuent d'appeler des erreurs
Une erreur c'est facile comme un et deux font quatre
Pour barrer d'un seul trait des années de terreur
Ce socialisme était une caricature
Si les temps ont changé des ombres sont restées
J'en garde au fond du coeur la sombre meurtrissure
Dans ma bouche à jamais la soif de vérité

Au nom de l'idéal qui nous faisait combattre
Et qui nous pousse encore à nous battre aujourd'hui

Mais quand j'entends parler de ""bilan"" positif
Je ne peux m'empêcher de penser à quel prix
Et ces millions de morts qui forment le passif
C'est à eux qu'il faudrait demander leur avis
N'exigez pas de moi une âme de comptable
Pour chanter au présent ce siècle tragédie
Les acquis proposés comme dessous de table
Les cadavres passés en pertes et profits

Au nom de l'idéal qui nous faisait combattre
Et qui nous pousse encore à nous battre aujourd'hui

C'est un autre avenir qu'il faut qu'on réinvente
Sans idole ou modèle pas à pas humblement
Sans vérité tracée sans lendemains qui chantent
Un bonheur inventé définitivement
Un avenir naissant d'un peu moins de souffrance
Avec nos yeux ouverts en grands sur le réel
Un avenir conduit par notre vigilance
Envers tous les pouvoirs de la terre et du ciel

Au nom de l'idéal qui nous faisait combattre
Et qui nous pousse encore à nous battre aujourd'hui"
