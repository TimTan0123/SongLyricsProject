0,Brenda Lee,All Alone Am I,TRKHQIM128F1456A10,1963,"All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No use in holding other hands
For I'd be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking just of your caress

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart

No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again.

All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just a beat of my heart
People all around but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart"
1,Bob Dylan,Blowin' In The Wind,TRIRXIZ128F426728F,1963,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?

Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they are forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?

Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?

Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
2,Cisco Houston,Do Re Mi,TRUXYTN12903CB286B,1963,"Well thousands of folks back east, they say,
Are leaving home most every day;
And they're beating the hot, old, dusty way to the California line.
Across the desert sands they roll,
A-getting' out of that old Dust Bowl.
And they think they're going to a sugar bowl,
And here is what they find.
The police at the port of entry say,
""You're number fourteen thousand for today.""

Chorus
If you ain't got the do-re-mi, boys,
If you ain't got the do-re-mi,
Well, you'd better go back to beatiful Texas,
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee.
California is a Garden of Eden,
It's a paradise to live in or see,
But, believe it or not, you won't find it so hot,
If you ain't got the do-re-mi.

Well, if you want to buy you a home or farm,
That deal nobody harm;
Or take your vacations by the mountains or the sea,
Don't swap your old cow for a car,
You'd better stay right where you are.
Well, you'd better take this little tip from me,
Because I look through the want ads every day,
And the headlines on the paper always say:

(Chorus)"
3,Mary Wells,Your Old Stand By,TROBSXI128F931B0A3,1963,"She left you last night 
And today you called me on the phone 
Asked me if you could come over 
'Cause you didn't want to be alone 
So you want me to stand in for her 
And be the love of your next act 
But this time I play the part so well 
There'll be no need for her coming back, 'cause... 

CHORUS: 
You know that I'm your old stand-by 
You know that you can call on me 
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell 
That she's left you in misery 

I know you only called me 'cause you needed company 
'Cause once again she's left you and your heart's in misery, but... 
(chorus) 

(repeat and fade): 
I don't wanna be your old stand-by 
I wanna be with you permanently 
I'm gonna play the part from the depths of my heart 
And you won't need nobody but me"
4,John Hammond,See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,TRWTOPP128F92FA445,1963,"Well, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
One kind favor I'll ask of you
Oh, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean

There's two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Gonna take me to my burying ground

Well, my heart stopped beating
My hands are cold
Well, my heart stopped beating
And my hands are cold
Well, my heart stopped beating
And my hands are cold
I believe just what the Bible told

Did you ever hear a coffin sound?
Did you ever hear a coffin sound?
Did you ever hear a coffin sound?
Then you know that the poor boy’s in the ground

Dig my grave with a silver spade
Well, you dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Let me down the golden chain

Have you ever heard the church bell tone?
Ever heard the church bell tone?
Did you ever hear a church bell tone?
Then you know that the poor boy’s dead and gone

I feel so good

One kind favor I'll ask of you
One kind favor I'll ask of you
It’s one kind favor I'll ask of you
Please see that my grave is kept clean"

And he's been blue since then"". ""Now he's 
Found somebody new and you want him back again"".

"" I still love him""

6,Brian Hyland,I'm Afraid To Go Home,TRDRHMO128F92D381E,1963,"I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home
Worries on my mind, afraid of what I'll find
Will my family be gone? I'm afraid to go home
Back to Tennessee, afraid of what I'll see

As I walk down this dusty road, got a heart with a heavy load
Ain't one thing that's the same, so much sorrow and pain
Headin' home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile
Ain't heard nobody sing, ain't seen one livin' thing

Someone's waitin' for me, honey sweet as candy
Wanna hold her tightLord, make her be all right
Maybe 'round on next bend, all the ashes of land
Valleys will be green instead of what I've seen

I'm afraid for the scrubby pine, for the sweet honeysuckle vine
I'm afraid for my home, for the fields that I roamed
Kick along down a homeward road, and your heart's gotta take the load
I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home

Sherman's been in my town, burned it all to the ground
Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea
Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea"
7,Bobby Bare,Shame On Me,TRTDVBH12903CA817D,1963,"Shame on me for hurting you what can I say what can I do
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me

You say you won't be seein' me again you say we're through
I wouldn't want to see the sunrise tomorrow if I knew that to be true
I know that just sayin' sorry doesn't sound out a lot
But the girl you saw me with last night means no more to me 
Than the thousand stars to the great clouds that cover the night
The more I look at her the more I realize how much I love you
Shame on me for hurting you...

I'll admit I shouldn't have given into love's wild temptation
With someone I cared nothing for I was blind and I hurt you
Can you ever forgive the fool the fool who really loves you
Last night I was blind but today I see I did you wrong shame on me"
8,Dionne Warwick,I Smiled Yesterday,TRGJUXP12903CC5B2B,1963,"Though I smiled yesterday
You know I'm not gonna smile anymore today 
(Since you went away from me)
How I miss you
(Since you went away from me)
I long to kiss you
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no

Though I laughed yesterday
You know I'm not gonna laugh anymore today
(Every moment we're apart)
I get so lonely
(Every moment we’re apart)
I love you only
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no

And baby, every day without you 
Is a day that's gonna turn out wrong
I need, need your love so badly
So won't you, won't you, won't you
Won't you let me smile again

Like I smiled yesterday
I don't wanna cry anymore like I cried today
(Baby hurry back to me)
I need your lovin'
(Baby hurry back to me)
Your tender lovin'
Until you are back with me
I'm never gonna smile anymore, oh no
 
And baby, every day without you 
Is a day that's gonna turn out wrong
I need, need your love so badly
So won't you, won't you, won't you
Won't you let me smile again

Like I smiled yesterday
I don't wanna cry anymore like I cried today

9,Patti Labelle & The Bluebelles,Danny Boy,TRHYQFQ128F4224C45,1963,"Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen

The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go
And I must bide

Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
The pipes are calling
From glen to glen and
Even down the mountainside

The summer's gone

Summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed
And even white with snow

Its' I'll be there in
Sunshine or in shadow

I love you so

Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

De la Sierra Morena
Cielito lindo, vienen bajando
Un par de ojitos negros
Cielito lindo, de contrabando

Ese lunar que tienes
Cielito lindo, junto a la boca
No se lo des a nadie
Cielito lindo que a mi me toca

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones"
11,Patsy Cline / The Jordanaires,You're Stronger Than Me,TRFKGXK128F14569CB,1963,"If you are sincere
When you say you don't care
That our love is just a memory.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still, fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

If you can have fun
With some other one
With no thought of what used to be.
If it's easy to say
That it's better this way
Darlin', you're stronger than me.

For if still lovin' you means I'm weak
Then I'm weak
For I still fall apart when we speak
Or we meet.
If the love that we knew
Won't bother you
Darlin', you're stronger than me..."

He's told me of your sweet caress
And of your lovely eyes

Telling him all these lies

That I'm in love with you

Oh, Kelly, please, please tell me

You had the sweetest boy in the world
Without a doubt you were the envy of every girl
You're the kind that's never satisfied
You want every boy to pass you by
But the tables turned (the tables turned)
'Cause his words tell you're done
Now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
You thought it was fun to make the boys run

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

'Cause now he's hangin' around my door
More happier than before
Now you're in misery 'cause you lost him to me
Now the hurt's on you, now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
You made bets, any boy you could get

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah

Yes, your loss is my gain
'Cause straight into my arms he came
You want every boy to pass you by
Now the hurt's on you, now the hurt's on you
Your little scheme backfired, it's true
Now tears of regret just covered your face

You lost the sweetest boy that you had that time
The sweetest boy that you had

The sweetest boy that you had"

18,Joan Baez,Long Black Veil,TRCRUXS128F92F1ED1,1963,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
The people who saw, they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold is high, eternity near
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me"
19,Skeeter Davis,Both Sides Now,TRLRLBA128F92E9D74,1963,"Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere I'd look at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done the clouds got in my way
I'd look at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow
It's cloud delusion I recall I really don't know cloud at all

Moons and Junes and fairy squeels the dizzi dancing way you feel
Is every fairytale complete I'd look at love that way
But now it's just another show we've been laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know don't give yourself away
I'd look at love...

Tears and fears and feeling proud say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I'd look at love that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads they say I'd change
But something's lost and something's gained in living every day
I'd look at love..."

When he's supposed to be mine?

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Play all my records, keep dancing all night

He looked kinda nice and so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know that he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine so I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home to meet his mom and his dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
I felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me
And then he kissed me"

Hello little girl.

When you're passing on your way

When I see you passing by
I cry mm mm hello little girl.
When I try to catch your eye
I cry mm mm hello little girl.

I send you flowers
But you don't care.
You never seem to see
Me standing there.
I often wonder
What you're thinking of.
I hope it's me
And love love love.

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say: mm you're my little girl.

It's not the first time
That it's happened to me,
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see
That I'm about to lose my mi-mi-ind.

So I hope there'll come a day
When you say: mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm.
You're my little girl, mm mm mm.
You're my little girl, oh yeah.
You're my little girl."

I got my diesel wound up and she's a-runnin' like a-never before
There's a speed zone ahead, but all right 
I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

I got me ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in a white 
I been a passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lot of women but I'm not a-like a-some other guys
I could find one to hold me tight 
But I could never make believe it's all right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

ICC is a checking on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight 
I can dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and that smoke's a-blowing black as coal
My hometown's a-comin' in sight

From loneliness to a wedding ring

And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen

I wish to the Lord that train would wreck,
Kill the engineer and break the fireman's neck.
Hey that train, carried my girl from town,

Rations on the table, coffee's gettin' cold,
Some dirty rounder stole my jelly roll.
Hey that train, carried my girl from town,

28,Joan Baez,With God On Our Side,TRPBXBI128F92F1EE0,1963,"Oh my name it is nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side.

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side.

Oh the Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side.

Oh the First World War, boys
It closed out its fate
The reason for fighting
I never got straight
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side.

When the Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war starts
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust 
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

In a many dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If God's on our side
He'll stop the next war."

It's too late to cry (too late to cry)
It's too late to cry now (too late to cry)
My love is gone away, yes she has (too late)
Wo wo (too late) she has (too late)

(spoken:)
I just guess that you're wonderin' why I always sing a sad song
But you see, I had a woman who was very good to me
And I can remember the times she used to sit down and tell me these words:
Said, 'Pickett, I want you to know I love you from the bottom of my heart
And whatever you need, I don't want you to go to your mother, your father, your sister or your brother
I'll be a leadin' pull when you're fallin' down
When all your money's gone, I want you to know you can count on me'
But I didn't appreciate that woman then
You know what? I had to run and chase after every little girl around town
So finally one day I got home and I found my little girl gone
And people, you know it hurt me so bad (ha ha) I had to hang my little head And cry
Then I began to read the letter she left for me layin' there; it read like this, children

It's too late, she's gone, oh (she's gone)
'It's too late I'm gone away' (she's gone)
Ah yeah (too late) don't you know it, children (too late)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Say it one more time (too late) listen (too late)
I wanna hear you understand what I'm talkin' about (too late)

""Children, children, get your hat""
""Mama, Mama, what you mean by that?""
""Get your hat, put it on your head

""Mama, mama, oh, how can it be?
My daddy got killed on the old I.C.""
""Hush your mouth I said and hold your breath

Two-forty for his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
I'm telling you that's my home.
You had romance, did you break it by chance
Over me?

That I'm not worth it, you see.
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home,
Mm, that's my home.
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man.
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye,
Everybody knows.
But I love them and I leave them,
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam,
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home.

My love said she'd come back to me
Before the leaves of autumn touched the ground, touched the ground
My love promised she'd be homeward bound

Then one by one the leaves began to fall
And now that winter's come to call

Will my last hope fall with that lonely leaf, lonely leaf
With the last leaf, the last leaf

Like a flame burning brightly

Blue velvet

Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart,
I've got to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart,

When I'm walkin' down the street
That's the place where you used to walk
The place where you held my hand
Now I reach and all I touch is space
An empty, empty place

Sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love
Reaching all the way to the stars above

And now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die
Only your embrace
Can fill this empty place

If I don't fill this emptiness
I know that I'll lose my mind
Looking out and only seeing space
An empty, empty place

Oh, sadness and tears, that's all you left me
They're such bad, bad souvenirs
Of a love that once was, oh, so very great
The greatest love
Reaching all the way to the stars above

But now there's not a star left in the sky
And if you don't come back to me I'll die

Come back and fill my empty arms

Your lips are lovin' darling"

Just to know somehow you are near

I have often walked on this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

Oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live"

He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face

That he won my heart

About how to become an All American Boy
Buy you a gittar and put it in tune
You'll be rockin' and rollin' soon.
Impressin' the girls, pickin' hot licks, and all that jazz

I-I bought me a gittar a year ago
Learned how to play in a day or so
And all around town it was well understood
That I was knockin' 'em out like Johnny B. Goode
Hot licks, showin' off, ah number one.

Well , I 'd practice all day and up into the night
My papa's hair was turnin' white
Cause he didn't like rock'n'roll
He said ""You can stay, boy, but that's gotta go.""
He's a square, he just didn't dig me at all

So I took my gittar, picks and all
And bid farewell to my poor ole pa
And I split for Memphis where they say all
Them swingin' cats are havin' a ball
Sessions, hot licks and all, they dig me

I was rockin' and boppin' and I's a gettin' the breaks
The girls all said that I had what it takes
When up stepped a man with a big cigar
He said ""come here, cat--I'm gonnna make you a star.""
""I'll put you on Bandstand, buy ya a Cadillac, sign here, kid.""

I signed my name and became a star
Havin' a ball with my gittar
Driving a big long Cadillac and fightin' the girls off ma back
They just kept a'comin', screamin', yeah-they like it

So I'd pick my gittar with a great big grin
And the money just kept on pourin' in
But then one day my Uncle Sam
He said (sound of 3 footsteps) ""Here I am""
""Uncle Sam needs you, boy
I'm-a gonna cut your hair
Ah-Take this rifle, kid
Gimme that gittar"" yeah."

I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad
My overalls were hand-me-downs my shoes were full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and yet our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flod my soul)"

106,Patti Labelle & The Bluebelles,Cool Water,TROPHGS12903CA93D8,1963,"All day I've faced the barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water, cool, clear water

Keep a-movin', Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan can you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water

The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Dan's feet are sore he's yearning for
Just one thing more than water, cool, water
Like me I guess he'd like to rest
Where there's no quest for water, cool, clear, water"
107,Mary Wells,What's Easy For Two Is So Hard For One,TRFNRPM128F931B0DE,1963,"Well well well well
Let's get together and go for a walk in the park
And while we're walking we can steal a little kiss in the dark
I wanna walk with you (I wanna walk with you)
I wanna talk with you (I wanna talk with you)
But it's up you to say ""Come on baby""
If you don't hurry up I'll go crazy
'Cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun

What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one

I'm sure that you know that I love you with all of my heart
But a love that's true really takes two to start
I wanna do my share (I wanna do my share)
To show you that I care (to show you that I care)
'Cause a one-sided love will never do
You gotta show me that you love me too
'Cause falling in love all alone is just no fun

One can build a love affair slowly
Two can build a love affair fast
One can make a love get started
Two can make it last

So come on and take me by the hand
Lead me up to the preacher man
Together we can do all the things that should be done

What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one

What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one"

My blue-eyed son?
And where have you been
My darling young one?

I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you see
My blue-eyed son?
And what did you see
My darling young one?

I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear
My blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear
My darling young one?

I heard the sound of the thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what did you meet
My blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet
My darling young one?

I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what'll you do now
My blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now
My darling young one?

I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where their home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden

Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountains so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singing

And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall"

If I was on some foggy mountain top...

If when you see that other blonde there's something you can tell her
She need not fool her time away tryin' to steal my feller
If I was on some foggy mountain top...

We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should of heard the whine from my screamin' machine
I flew past LaBrea, Schwab's, and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights

But I pulled her out and there I was
At Dead Man's Curve

Into the magic night. I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do.
Then I fall asleep to dream My dreams of you.

In dreams I walk with you. In dreams I talk to you.
In dreams you're mine. All of the time we're together 
In dreams, In dreams.

But just before the dawn, I awake and find you gone.

Was a happy, jolly soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

(Frosty the snowman)
(Frosty the snowman)

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying ""Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.""

As the fog was lifting a voice was calling, ""This land was

I bought me a guitar about a year ago and I
Learned how to play it in a day or so.

Hot licks, showing off, ah, number one.
Well I practiced all day and up into the night,
My papa's hair was a gettin kinda white.
He didn't dig that,ah, rock and roll.
He said, ""You can stay boy, but that's gotta go.""
He's a square; just didn't dig me at all.
So I packed my guitar, picks and all, bid farewell to my poor old pa.
I split for Memphis where they say 'you all'
And them swinging cats are a havin a ball.
Yeah, they love me down there, guitar picks and all.
I was rocking and bopping and getting all the breaks,
And the girls all said that I had what it takes,
When up steps a man with a big cigar. He said. ""Come here, kid.
I'm gonna make you a star.""
Put you on ""Bandstand', buy you a cadillac. Sign here, kid.""
So I signed my name and became a star, having a ball with my guitar.
Driving a big, long cadillac. And fighting the girls off'n my back.
But they just keep a comin, screaming, they love it.
So I picked my guitar with a great big grin
And the money just kept on rollin in.

Now, if he's serious or if he's playin'
Oom mow mow is all he's sayin
Papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Doot doot doot
Doot doot doot

I said-a hey there, partner, what's your name?
Now don't you dare tell me the same old thing
The words you sang, I can't figure it out
But hearing that sound makes me stop and shout
Papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Doot doot doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot
Doot doot doot
Doot doot doot

A papa-papa-papa-papa-oom-mow-mow
Papa-oom-mow-mow
Doot doot doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot

Now, I hear this sound everywhere I go
On the records, TV, and the radio
And now it's spreadin' out over the land
I still can't seem to understand
Papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-hoooo
Doot doot doot, doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot, doot
Doot doot doot, doot, doot, doot
Papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hoooo
Papa-papa-papa-hooooooo"
154,Antonio Carlos Jobim,Desafinado,TRLMEUS128F92EFA7B,1963,"Se você disser que eu desafino, amor
Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor
Só privilegiados tem ouvido igual ao seu
Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu

Se você insiste em classificar
Meu comportamento de antimusical
Eu, mesmo mentindo devo argumentar
Que isso é bossa nova, que isso é muito natural

O que você não sabe, nem sequer pressente
É que os desafinados também tem coração
Fotografei você na minha Rolleiflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão

Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor
Este é o maior que você pode encontrar, viu!
Você com a sua música esqueceu o principal
Que no peito dos desafinados
No fundo do peito, bate calado
No peito dos desafinados
Também bate um coração!"
155,Vic Damone,Maria,TRHGHUM128F4261AA1,1963,"The most beautiful sound I ever heard, Maria
Maria, Maria, Maria
All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word, Maria
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria

I've just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me, Maria

I've just kissed my child named Maria
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be, Maria

Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's almost like praying

Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria

Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's almost like praying

Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria

The most beautiful sound I ever heard, Maria"

Where can you be, i wait patiencely
My heart cries out, the pain inside
Where can you be, i wait patiencely

When you're alone, the going get's rough
Come back, come back, come back
I've had enough

Make me a queen, happy again
Hear my cries, he's my king

157,The Dillards,Reuben's Train,TRPZVOY128F423073D,1963,"Ol Reuben made a train &amp; he put it on a track
He ran it to the Lord knows where
Oh me, oh my ran it to the Lord knows where

Should been in town when Reuben's train went down
You could hear that whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you could hear the whistle blow 100 miles

Last night I lay in jail had no money to go my bail
Lord how it sleeted &amp; it snowed
Oh me, oh my Lord how it sleeted &amp; it snowed

I've been to the East, I've been to the West
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow
Oh me, oh my I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow

Oh the train that I ride is 100 coaches long
You can hear the whistle blow 100 miles
Oh me, oh my you can hear the whistle blow 100 miles

I got myself a blade, laid Reuben in the shade,
I'm startin' me a graveyard of my own.
Oh, me, oh lordy my, startin' me a graveyard of my own.

158,The Rolling Stones,Fortune Teller,TRANHKC128F9309BF4,1963,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 

Siad she'd take a look at my palm
She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
And I get my fortune told for free"
159,Johnny Cash,The Little Drummer Boy,TRBIWUQ12903CA4390,1963,"Come they told me our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the King
This is to honor him when we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring that's fit to give a King
But may I play for you on my drum
The mother Mary nodded, the ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for him I played my best for him
Then he smiled at me, me and my drum"
160,Bill Anderson,Still,TRVOHGY12903D13D99,1963,"(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still
(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

I've lost count of the hours 
And I've lost track of the days  
In fact, I've lost just about everything 
Since you went away  
Everything, that is, except the memories you left me
And that's one thing that no one can mar  

I don't know who you're with 
I don't even know where you've gone  
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song 
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you  
And I love you, wherever you are

(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire 
For every day it burns hotter 
And every day it burns higher  
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker 
Not even with all of these tears  

My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am  
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can 
For some day, you might just decide to come home 
And I want you to know   
I'm still here

(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still"
161,THE CHIFFONS,I Wonder Why,TRGSCNG128F426E6B4,1963,"Dont' know why I love you like I do, don't know why I do.
Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want your love to share

I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do.

I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part

When you're with me, I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away, I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
Don't know why I do."

The days are dawned
You don't have to worry
You can have your fun

Take me, baby
For your little boy
Because three hundred pounds
Of a heavenly joy

This is it, this is it
Look what you get

You've been bending
And hiding 'round behind his back
And you got your man
That you don't like

Throw that Jack, baby
Outta your mind
Follow me, baby
And have a real good time

This is it, this is it
Look what you get

Hoy, hoy
I'm the boy
I've got three hundred pounds
Of a heavenly joy

I'm so glad
That you understand
I'm three hundred pounds
Of muscle and man

This is it, this is it
Look what you get"

Why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybelline
Why can't you be true?

You've started back doin'
The things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybelline in a Coupe de Ville
Cadillac rollin' on an open road
But nothin' outrun my V8 Ford
Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
Bumper to bumper rollin' side to side

Maybelline
Why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybelline
Why can't you be true?

You've started back doin'
The things you used to do

Well,
The Cadillac moved to ahead of the Ford
A Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It just that time, it started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water poured up
Under my motor hood
I knew that were doin' my motor good

Maybelline
Why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybelline
Why can't you be true?

You've started back doin'
The things you used to do

Motor cooled down, the heat went down
That's when I heard that highway sound
Cadillac seemin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill

Maybelline
Why can't you be true?
Oh, Maybelline
Why can't you be true?

You've started back doin'
The things you used to do"
