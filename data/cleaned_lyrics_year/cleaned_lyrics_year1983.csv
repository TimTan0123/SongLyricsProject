0,Grand Funk Railroad,Don't Lie To Me  (Album Version),TRHFYIW128F423215C,1983,"Well there was something said
And my face turnerd red
I didn't believe it
But now we're laying here in bed
And there's something wrong
Honey, it's way too strong
Boy, better ignore it
We've been together for so long

Don't lie to me
Oh, baby please
Don't lie to me
I said baby please
Don't lie to me
Oh, baby please
Don't lie to me
Oh, don't you lie to me now

Babe, it's time to sacrifice
'Cause I've heard it twice
I should've believed it
When I heard it from the guys
That you was out all night
And it wasn't right
The very next mornin'
You told me everything's alright

But, don't lie to me
I said baby please
Don't lie to me
Oh, baby please
Don't lie to me
I said baby please
Don't lie to me
Ohh, don't lie to me
Now girl, don't lie to me

Well, don't lie to me
I said baby please
Don't lie to me
Oh, baby please
Don't lie to me
I said baby please
Don't lie to me
Girl, don't you lie to me
Never lie, don't you lie to me
Hey, please, don't you lie to me, now

I know what you're tryin'
Better stop your cryin'
You better cut it out
'Cause you're gonna be cryin' to me, now
Babe, don't cry to me
Oh, girl, girl, don't you lie to me
Well, don't you lie to me, now
Babe, don't lie to me
Girl, don't you lie to me
Don't you lie to me ..."
1,ZZ Top,I Need You Tonight (LP Version),TRTCRBU128EF34426C,1983,"It's three o'clock in the morning
and the rain begin to fall
but I know what I'm needin
but I don't have it all.
I'm needin someone like you
that I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.

Outside my window
it's lonely and cold.
Inside my heart there's a fire
burning out of control.
Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.

Your love's coming to me
like a wolf howling at the moon
but that just doesn't do me
if I can't get you soon.
I'm calling for someone like you
that I just wanna do love to.
Baby, baby, I need you tonight."
2,Cyndi Lauper,I'll Kiss You,TRGXPPA128F42842B7,1983,"Went down to the local gypsy
And I handed her the same line--
'You know what I want from you
So honey won't ya gimme #9'
Cause you know lately I ain't feelin so great--
Last time she gave me love potion #8
And you know pretty baby how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart--

The gypsy told me that the first thing
That would happen you get dizzy
Second thing you better make sure
That your boyfriend isn't busy
Cause you won't wanna eat
And you won't wanna drink
You won't wanna talk
And you won't wanna think
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait!

I'll Kiss you
Gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll Kiss you
Don't tell me nothing--I--I--don't wanna know
And twidely--dee--and twidely--dum
I'll Kiss you, I'll Kiss you, I'll Kiss you

Hopped into a taxi, and I told the driver 
Got to get me cross town
Killed the bottle, started seeing double
When the driver turned around
And though I was a failure with love potion #8
#9 was different and the hour's getting late
Now I'm standing on the corner 
Everyone looks great to me
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be--

I'll Kiss you...
...I'll Kiss you
I'll Kiss you"
3,China Crisis,Hanna Hanna,TROUMAI128F1458949,1983,"Hanna Hanna, she sing
Mixed emotion and a garden strange
Hanna Hanna, she sing

We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
And swimming with the sharks

Tape record her and telephone
Conversations in pyramids alone
Why should I stop to think what they're about
why should I stop, stop to think what they're about

We're living on a catwalk, catwalk
And swimming with the sharks
Biting into poison, poison
In a city all full of fucking sharks

She sing
A guitar plays
In a garden strange

Hanna Hanna, she dream
Mixed emotion and a garden strange
She never there, she never there
Hanna Hanna, she dream"
4,Yes,Hearts,TRGWBZG128F42392D5,1983,"Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you

Set your heart sail on the river (Hearing)
Look around you as you drift downstream (Talking)
Pouring souls into the ocean (Love you)
Take account of all you've seen

One people - Together
Freedom for today
So easy the future
So see the children's way

Love me
Teach me
Know me

One people - Together
Freedom for today
Tomorrow forever
So see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers our hearts entwine
How we talk - How we teach our children
How they move - We direct our eyes
All the senses tuned discovery
As and as and when our hearts decide
Be ready now - Be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

(Hearts)
One heart's for love
One's for giving (Sailing down the river)

Two hearts are better than one

Days that we knew it was clear with you
You sing the answers question time
Now that you need me let our hearts entwine
Let our hearts entwine

Hearts - Sailing down the river
Hearts - Throwing out a line
I hearing it - I living it - I believe in it - I loving it

All angels of the magic constellation
Be singing us now"
5,Dave Edmunds,Information,TRWUQPH128F428EB7C,1983,"She's been around me all the while.
Try as I might, I can't forget her smile.
In passing conversation, what did I hear her say?
Where did she come from? Who is that woman anyway?
What can I do to change her mind?
Maybe she thinks that I'm just not her kind.
I think she wants me but she's trying to play hard to get.
When she treats me this way, I wish we'd never met.
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, that's what I need.
Some information.
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, give me a lead.
Some information.
The lights go down, the music's loud.
She's not around, I lost her in the crowd.
I really want her, but she's just a mystery.
What have I got to do to make her notice me?
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, that's what I need.
Some information.
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, give me a lead.
Some information.
If only I could find a way.
What do I have to do to make her stay?
I've got to find her again and try to steal her heart.
What I need is a lead, but I don't know where to start.
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, that's what I need.
Some information.
Information, that's what I need,
Some information. Where did she come from?
Information, give me a lead.

6,Willie Nelson,Changing Skies,TRGRLGE128F4260369,1983,"There's a bird in the sky 
Flying high, flying high 
To a place from a place 
Changing skies, changing skies 
There are clouds in the sky 
Clouds of fear and despair 
But love like ours never dies 
Changing skies, changing skies 

Little bird have you heard 
Freedom lies, freedom lies 
But love like ours never dies 
Just changing skies, changing skies"
7,The Police,Synchronicity II,TRQFLGN128E07912D0,1983,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take

Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark
Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen
Like cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now, looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache

Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away..."
8,Chris LeDoux,Montana Rodeo,TRCEPEN128F1490384,1983,"There's a rodeo in Montana where they come from miles around
Where they throw the hooligan and a bunch of beer cans 
All over that little cow town from Friday night to Sunday afternoon
The party goes on nonstop
Ranch hands and rodeo fans are drinking up the very last drop
And they all head for Montana at the foot of the Great Divide
To tie one up or tie one onor to tear it down or ride
So if you're lookin' for a rondavue where the Wild West never dies
You best make it on up to Montana on the right day in July

Now there's some college boys for lazuli here school is just let out
They got a keg of beer on a tub of ice in the back of a brand new Scout
Well they're all longhorns and as sure as you're born
They'll be checkin' those honey's out
And the girls in the cut off jeans might just show 'em what its all about
And there's Indians from the ranches all dressed up in cowboy clothes
Snap button shirts and silver belt buckles and boots with pointed toes
Short hair Stetson hats wiggin' on a jug of Yellow Stone
Well they look more like cowboys then the cowboys I have known
And there's some hippies here from God knows where a puffin' up a cloud of smoke
They got hair down past their shoulders and their clothes are a national joke
They got beads and leather and bells and feathers and moccasins for shoes
Well they look more like Indians than the real live Indians do
And then there's barrel racers and a bull riders and bronc stompers to boot
Struttin' their stuff like Peacocks out in back of the chutes
Tight Levis fancy chaps spurs with five star rowels
And the bull just stands there chewin' his cut lookin' wiser than a tree full of owls
And they all head for Montana..."
9,Soft Cell,Loving You Hating Me,TRGXKEP128F9310E1D,1983,"We've hit those depths again
Playing black games again
Black mellow lies
And the narrowing of eyes
Playing those games again
You hold the reins again
But then I turned the card
And you know I hit hard

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

Shaking your head that way
It's so true when they say
That love is a pain in the heart
A pain that pulls apart
I'm breaking rules again
You're breaking hearts again
Pretend to despise
When there's love in your eyes

Loving you, hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the side that you don't want to see

And I'm loving you
And you're hating me
It's the other side of love
It's the other side of love"
10,Oingo Boingo,Dead Or Alive,TRIHPCY128F146737E,1983,"There in the shadows, looks like a hand
Without its owner to give it a command
It's got a purpose, but I don't know what it is
I'm in trouble

There in the streets, looks like a man
But something wrong that I don't understand
His eyes are open, but he doesn't see a thing
His skin is peeling off; his bones are sticking out
I'm getting scared

Oh, my God (Is it dead?)
Is it living? (Is it dead?)
Is it dead or alive?
(Is it dead?), is it dead? (Is it dead?)
Is it dead? (Is it dead?)
Is it dead or alive?

Hiding in the cupboards like little mice
Hiding in the 'frigerator; that isn't nice 
It's not an animal; it don't have legs
No one else can see it

It moves so fast, corner of my eye
Look again, it's gone; it's hiding
Won't somebody help me; doesn't anybody care?
It waits so patiently for me to lose my guard
I'm getting scared

Is it dead, is it
(Is it dead)
Is it dead
(Is it dead)
Is it dead or alive?

(Is it dead)
Is it dead 
(Is it dead)
Is it dead, is it

I remember there was a time
When ""dead"" and ""buried"" meant just that 
Underneath the cold, dark ground
Things stay put!

Oh, them bones, they make them bodies walk
Them bones, them bones
If they could only talk!

Is it dead, is it
(Is it dead)
Is it dead
(Is it dead)
Is it dead or alive?
Is it dead

11,JFA,Johnny D,TRIKQFB128F428BE10,1983,"I hate Johnny D
he's such a f**king geek
playing all that lame shit
trying for a new wave hit

your lame, phoenix is tame

I hate Clyde Geek

go to HB and see who kicks
Johnny D, Clyde's, Merlin's go die"
12,Lionel Richie,Hello,TRRUXAH128E078FECB,1983,"I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you"
13,The Cure,The Walk,TRBJVTL128E078E91A,1983,"I called you after midnight
Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

We walked around a lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
We both play dead, then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

Everything
Everything
Everything

I called you after midnight
Then ran until my heart burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything

Everything
Everything
Everything"
14,Nena,99 Luftballons (New Version) - Clean Radio Version,TRMJNII128E078ACCB,1983,"Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: ""Krieg!"" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk an dich und lass ihn fliegen"
15,Spinetta Jade,Era De Uranio,TRRGQFS128F427E0D5,1983,"El mandarín
se descentró,
sus manos ya no son
aquellos subibajas
no todo fue fortuna
ni la ropa de las luces,
son cuerpos apretados
hacia el cielo.

Con un piolín
se suspendió,
la vieja bailarina absurda
de los circos
los árboles que caen
ya nada retrocede,
yo ya quiero tus manos,
tus manos del alma.

Y el sonido de la madrugada se demoró
con el viento se cansó de amdar y andar...
y un vendaval trasmutará
en la llovizna de esta era de uranio

Y al despertar
seremos luz,
y caeremos como gotas de agua
la vieja melodía trendrá su calor igual
y el ave siempre emigrará otra vez

El cantautor desafinó
su beba cuando quedó sola
corrió un mueble
sus cartas se mojaban
se borraban pequeños azabaches de la música."

You don't even try
To do the things you should

Why you can't be good

You say you gotta powder your nose
But the powder is cocaine 
I see traces on your clothes
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

Take another look inside your dreams tonight
When you go to sleep
Try and find the reasons why you've lost your way
Like some little sheep

You say that you love me
That that your heart is true
But you've got so many other loves,
What am I s'posed to do?
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

Take another look inside your dreams tonight
When you go to sleep
Try and find the reasons why you've lost your way
Like some little sheep

Your face looks so pretty
But your mind is such a mess
You got a cold and wicked heart that's lurkin'
Underneath your breast
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

18,Savage Grace,The Dominatress,TRBPCBB12903D0725B,1983,"In the cell below I wait knowing that my painful fate is near
Her silhouette appears, her beauty so disarming, I've no fear
I cry with delight as she unleashes all her fury upon me
Her touch does excite, my body bleeds, but I just beg for more

I know the pain of all who've come before me
I feel the power in her whip as she strikes me
I see the blood in her eyes as she makes me scream
THE DOMINATRESS

My body chained and shackled I beg for mercy as she laughs
The sweet torture takes its toll how I pray to God to let me go
The devil's daughter she may be a sinful sinner's sin for me
Blinded by desire for more blood her caress of leather burns my love"

Tell me, who's watching?

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from 9 to 5, hey, hell, I pay the price

But why do I always feel
Like I'm in the Twilight Zone? And

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me, or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, whoa
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

Who's watching me?
I don't know anymore!
Are the neighbours watching me?
Who's watching?
Well, is the mailman watching me?
Tell me, who's watching?
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
Who?
The IRS?!

Shivering with fear
Stands tall fears his fall
His time is drawing near
When he's done will he end
Or will he bite the dust
Is this his nemesis?
Arms of swords are crossed

Sparks fly through the sky
The sound of blood and steel
Crowd cheers laughs and tears
His wound will never heal
Kneels down face the ground
Before the emperor
He's might wrong or right
He is superior

Thumbs down
And soon the swords will fall
Thumbs down
And soon the heads will roll
Gladiator
Hell will take you

Thumbs down...

To dicover the tricks you've been brewing

Keep out of the kitchen
If you can't stand the cold
Don't sleep on the floor
If you can't, if you can't bear to look
Wonder what you're missing

Don't play it down
When you don't have the power to hold it
Don't play the clown

Take a look at how you've give up your fantasy
When you turn and run away

Understand me, can you hear me call.

Night time, surely it's a lie,
No-one ever told me, I just let the chance go by
Wishing there was time enough, you tell me there's no time, but I can try.

(Chorus repeat)

Speak now, without the summer light
All the words I should have spoken, when you held me tight
Still I'll keep in calling, till the morning ends another lonely night.

(Chorus repeat)

I'll be waiting for you hoping, that someday you'll hear me calling
But there's never any answer, just the echo of the call"

She's run away, boy if you see her 
I'm beggin' you to stop her on sight

She's a runaway, a runaway 
And why she'd leave I still can't believe 
That she would run away, run away 
Run away, run away 
She's a runaway 

I walked the streets through the heart of the city 
Go to the places where she might be 
I see her friends they say it's a pity 
I get the same thing from everyone that I see 

I'll keep searchin' if it's gotta be 
And when I find her I'll make her see 
No other man could love her like me

i was falling over walking down the street
i sold all my records for a months supply
and i've seen my doctor and i'm gonna die

60,The Style Council,Headstart For Happiness,TRLBUGD128F145FE96,1983,"When I find you waiting hours; oh,
You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space betweeen us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you.

You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence

In yourself and all you've got to take this world
And shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power

To rise above the lies
'Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild - common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a headstart back to you."

Thought I was going to run
But the cross fire is in my eyes
And my body holds the gun
Here I come

You better get ready to make your move
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm going to shoot
Get ready make your move
Got your name on my bullet and my aim is true

You better not mess around with me
I got you in my sights
I've been running on a really bad streak
Going to shoot you down tonight

My back's against the wall
You know that you better think twice
One of us is going to fall
I'm looking for a fight and the time is right

You better get ready to make your move
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm going to shoot

Not because of any talent but because I was the
Only one the suit would fit
Everybody shopping, little sticky kids were hopping
On my lap with their fingers in my beard,
I guess they thought that I was really it
She sat down on my lap and said to me
""I'm twenty three and I need someone
You look like someone who could play with me
Stay with me, all day with me""

'Cause I'm in no man's land
Can't seem to find a real man
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man
She said I'm in no man's land
I'm gonna show you a real good time

She was beggin' to be mine, but my job was on the line
Should I say or should I go? I just didn't know
...Hmmmm

I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying
And their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear
I never heard such profanity
I dropped my suit on the floor,
They were trying to block the door
They were calling her a whore
They were driven to nativital insanity
We drove away in her Mercedes Benz,
Dirty blond split ends in the breeze
She said ""I want to put you under my tree
You're just a little gift from me to me""

'Cause I'm in no man's land
Can't seem to find a real man
You know I'm lookin' for a steel man
She said I'm in no man's land

I'd gladly pay you double overtime

She had money all her life
She wasn't lookin' to become my wife
She said, ""I hope you understand,
I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""

She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin
Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities
She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes
She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality

She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me
It's warmer here by the fire""
She didn't know that there was more of me
She'd have to learn to love all four of me

'Cause I'm in no man's land
I'm lookin' for the real me
If only I could feel me
You know I'm in no man's land
Sometimes I gotta play me
It's really hard to stay me
Hey, I'm in no mans land
I'm looking for the real me
If only I could feel me
You know I'm in no man's land
Sometimes I gotta play me
It's really hard to stay me
Oh, I'm in no man's land

Street corner wonder lust
Beckoning the good guy
Take this, get that
Have a good time

He ready for anything that is
How they jive and jingle
They've read the book that gives

Take him for a ride
Have a good time

His woman gladly watching
As he strides out of the dark
Better be quick, get away

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Good timing has its good price
One trick and you're stuck with the dice
How they jive and jingle
When you're their sacrifice

Fast as lightning
Go - Go get high - He's looking good
Once bitten, twice shy
No woman no cry
No woman don't cry

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Think you got all the problems
Well why not try and solve them
Instead of sitting on them

Taking on new projects
Steadily slipping sideways
Close your ears to reason
Your very valued opinion

Nothing is getting nowhere
Never meaning what you're saying
Well now I need a decision
Not empty headed ambition

Solitaire"

Through the ions, you hide and I wait

Warm your blood runs
Come in from the cold

Are now just pieces of paper

Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

If you look the part you'll get the job
In last year's trousers and your old school shoes
The truth is son, it's a buyer's market
They can afford to pick and choose

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because I dress like this
Doesn't mean I'm a communist

The factories are closing and the army's full
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I've come to see in the Land of the Free
There's only a future for the Chosen Few

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

At twenty one you're on top of the scrapheap
At sixteen you were top of the class
All they taught you at school
Was how to be a good worker
The system has failed you, don't fail yourself

84,The Charlie Daniels Band,Stroker's Theme,TRVYPEI128F427082E,1983,"Stroker Ace was born to race. 
He had a mean streak ten feet wide. 
A son of a gun with a taste for fun and 
More than his share of pride. 
Take a dirt road curve with the devil's 
Nerve and make a car dance across the mud. 
Hauling shine was his regular line 'til the 
Track got in his blood. 

Was a real hot shot and he bragged a lot but, 
Man that fool could drive. 
'Cause he loved the feel of the steering wheel 
And the girls with the bed-room eyes. 
And in a racing tide or a bar room fight old Stroker stole the show.
A back stretch blazer, a real hell raiser and a race track Romeo. 

Mama lock your daughters up
That wild bunch is back in town 
And them little girls get frisky
When they hear that racecar sound 
They're bringin out the yellow flag,
Somebody's brakes have failed 
There's an oilslick on the inside
And a wreck along the rail 
You better stand on it, Stroker,
Cause a bandit's on your tail. 

It's a downright joy for a country boy 
When he hears them engines moan 
But you gotta hang tough and it gets real rough 
When you're out there on your own 
Cause they'll push you around, they'll knock you down 
They'll shove ya up against the wall 
And you always know when an engine blows 
And a man can't win 'em all 
You could push that car
Just a little too far any Sunday afternoon 
And if you break your neck
In some d---- fool's wreck they'll forget about you soon 
But old Stroker Ace was born to race
And it's worth all the trying 
Just to drink champagne in the Victory Lane
And to hear that concrete whine 

Stroker get your dander up
This ain't no time to lag 
You've got to make a lap up
If you want to take that checkered flag 
Number ten is closin' in to even up the score 
It's time to wave bye-bye and put the pedal on the floor 
You better stand on it Stroker
Cause you're blowin' off their doors. 

Blow their doors off, Stroker. 
Stand on it, Son. 
Ah, you good lookin' devil, you."

Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip

Say your prayers
Say your prayers

And I wonder why
I don't despise

Is love what was once
So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes
I'd better realize

Your eyes without a face
Such a human waste
Your eyes without a face

To fall in love again

Every morning he got up dreading each moment he had to be awake
He’d look at the floor and scribble on gum wrappers
He never found a better way to joke around
The clock would tick and time was slow

There wasn’t anywhere that he wouldn’t go
To avoid having to see anyone
He’d sit in a chair and lean against the wall
He just didn’t seem to matter much at all

But late at night, he had a savior
In his sleep, in his dreams
She came to him and she said
""Poor you, poor you
No one understands you
Poor you, poor you""

And every word that everyone would say
Got mumbled up in his head
Like mumblejumble and everywhere he went
It seemed everyone was saying to him
""Blah Blah Blah""

But late at night, he had a mistress
In his dreams, in his sleep
And she would say
""Poor you, poor you
No one understands you
Poor you, poor you""

This story, though not well told
Is not that old
It’s not that funny, it’s not that great
But I know it to be true

Because late at night, I have an angel
In my dreams, in my sleep
And as she runs her fingers through my hair
As I lay on her lap and she says
""Poor you, poor you
No one understands you
Poor you, poor you"""

If that' s your problem don't let it show.
You will find it self deceiving love can be unsure.
Keep a level head maintain your pride.
Then you can face the situation straight in the eye.

And especially when she comes on strong.
When she smiles that smile that leads you on.
Try to see it through playing out your part.
Making certain when you give your heart its.

CHORUS
Only For Love
Only For Love
Only For Love

Love was never planned ever before.
Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure.
But as suddenly as that love will arrive.
And you'll recognise the feeling ooh your on fire.

And especially as she moves in close.
When she moves that move there's no suppose.
You'll find you're hunting when you'se apart.
But when you give your heart its.

Misleading masquerade 

We hide our pain 
We try to laugh 
Fools to think our tears 
Would provoke holy wrath 
In stone-gray silence 
We do not face our fears 
We bite our lips 
And we press on with feeble cheer 
With hearts of sadness 
We say our thankful prayers 
Refusing comfort unawares 

We hide our pain 
We try to laugh 
Fools to think our tears 
Would provoke holy wrath 

We learn the protocol 
We bare our souls to none 
We praise our peers

127,Ruben Blades,Pedro navaja,TRDXRYE128F4266852,1983,"PEDRO NAVAJA  (RUBÉN BLADES)

Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar,
Con el tumba'o que tienen los guapos al caminar,
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal.

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio la'o
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir vola'o,
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando ríe se ve brillando.

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar.

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida,
No tiene marcas, pero to' saben que es policía. Mmm...
Pedro Navaja, las manos siempre dentro el gabán,
Mira y sonríe y el diente de oro vuelve a brillar.

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina,
No se ve un alma, está desierta to'a la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Y Pedro Navaja aprieta un puño dentro 'el gabán.

Mira pa' un lado, mira pa' el otro y no ve a nadie,
Y a la carrera, pero sin ruido, cruza la calle.
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer.

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revólver,
Esa mujer, y va a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe.
Un treinta y ocho ""ESmith &amp; Wesson"" del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal.

Y Pedro Navaja, puñal en mano, le fue pa' encima,
El diente de oro iba alumbrando to'a la avenida,
¡quiso fácil!, mientras reía el puñal le hundía sin compasión,
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un cañón.

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía a esa mujer
Que, revólver en mano y de muerte herida, a él le decía:
""Yo que pensaba: hoy no es mi día, estoy sala',
Pero, Pedro Navaja, tú estás peor: no estás en na'"".

Y créanme ""gente"" que aunque hubo ruido nadie salió.
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas, nadie lloró.
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezó,
Cogió el revolver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó.

Y tropezando se fue cantando desafina'o,
El coro que aquí les traje dirá el mensaje de mi canción:
""La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!""

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!
Pedro Navaja matón de esquina, quien a hierro mata a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida ¡ay, Dios!

Maleante pescador, mal anzuelo que tiraste,
En vez de una sardina un tiburó' enganchaste

(la la la lara la la laaa)

(la la la lara la la laaa)

I like to live in America

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!

Ocho millones de historias tiene la ciudad de Nueva York

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!

Como decía mi abuelita: ""El que de último ríe, se ríe mejor""

(la la la lara la la laaa)

(la la la lara la la laaa)

I like to live in America

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida

Cuando lo manda el destino, no lo cambia ni el más bravo,
Si naciste pa' martillo, del cielo te caen los clavos

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!

En barrio de guapos cuida'o en la acera,
Cuida'o camara' que el que no corre vuela

La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida, ¡ay, Dios!

Como en una novela de Kafka el borracho dobló por el callejón

La vida te da...

En la ciudad de Nueva York, dos personas fueron encontradas muertas.
Esta madrugada los cuerpos sin vida de Pedro Barrios y Josefina Wilson
Fueron hallados en una de las calles adyacentes a la autopista New York Inside,
En el bajo Manhatan, entre las avenidas A y B. La causa de la muerte aún no se supo..."

Or something just to hold on to.
Always know that love will find a way.

Is it hard this life you're living.
Does the world seem so unkind.

That says I can't stay here anymore

And haven't we felt this same way
Sure in our hearts, but afraid just the same
To say I can't stay one minute more

You might think that it's hopeless
Beyond our control
But that's not necessarily so
Can't you see there's a chance
For the daring young soul
Who's finally learned to say no

No, I won't be misused
Ignored or refused
And I won't just give up and let go

So tonight hold me close to you
And don't give up what's important to you
And as time rolls on
Nothing can stand in our way

And I believe if we learn from the past
We'd find keys to unlock every door
Dark would turn into light
We'd be strong
We'd be right

So tonight hold me close to you
And don't give up what's important to you
And as time rolls on
Nothing will stand in our way

And I believe if we learn from the past
We'd say haven't we been here before
Oh, and I believe if we open our hearts
We'd find keys to unlock every door
Hearts could change overnight
We'd be strong...We'd be right
So stay with me now
The future is ours
And we'll be the ones who go on"

But they called it little boy,
And C7, H5, O6, N3 they called him
T-N-T.

The fireball would dim the sun,
Promising death in its cruelest form.

Hiroshima Mon Amour
As we beg to be forgiven do you spit,
In our face and curse us all.

The fireball that shamed the sun,
Burning the shadows on the ground,
As the rain falls to dry the land,
Leaving desert for the thirsty man.

They all said it would end the war,
And we thanked Christ for the bomb,
And the priests and witches all agreed,
They should die to keep them free.

The fireball that shamed the sun,
Burning the shadows on the ground,
As the rain falls to dry the land,
Leaving the desert for the thirsty man.

With devils on his sleeve

Won't you dance with me?

You don't seem real at all
Like a premonition
Of curses on my soul

Well it could be against the law

You've made the angels fall

Now when I'm smiling I know why
You light up my world like the morning sun
Your so deep within me we’re almost one

All the fears that I have start to fade
I was always afraid love might forget me
That love might let me down
Then look who I found

The winds might blow through me but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there

And now, now
Now when I wake there's someone home
I'll never face the nights alone

To open my heart and to let you in

Fall for him
She would fall

She wore her mother's cocktail dress
With saddle shoes
She was pretty and she was small
She worked the switchboard
Down the hall from him
Down the hall

Chorus:
He said: 'Hello little woman'
She said: 'Hello big man'
And that was how the wooing
And the winning began
He said: 'Hello little woman'
She said: 'Hello big man'

Was carriage rides and matinees
He took her to a ball
At the Waldorf Astoria
He would fall for her
Fall for her, he would fall

You could hear them laugh
As they danced in their room
And the shadows on the avenue
Rose into a jealous moon
Which swung low in the dawn like
To see what was going on with those two

you keep on expecting
Something to go wrong
And nothing does
They still live in the house
Where we were born
Pictures of us kids
Hanging up all over the walls


And some say he built his empire
For wealth and toil
But, if you ask him why
He'll say he did it all for her
All for her
All for her

Underneath that ghostly pale is that you 
Someone in your shape shouldn't be driving 
Someone in your shape shouldn't be doing anything at all

You should see yourself in the mirror 
With your leather lips and your snakeskin shoes 
Do you have to shout in my ear 
Do me a favor, just stop talking for a minute or two

You crack me up, you really really do 
With your sunglasses on, acting so young 
Only I know what you're really up to 
You break me up

No, I don't want to sit in your sports car 
No, I don't want to hear a tune 
All the locals say you'll go far 
That's funny; they don't know you like I do

You crack me up you twisted wreck 
Shouding in the parking lot, think you'll give it one more shot 
Better hope they'll cash a check 
You break me up

You better ask yourself a question 
Cause you cant live like this for long 
You better listen to my suggestion 
Before you wind up in somebody else's song"

Waiting for the answer to a promise
And all at once he sees them
In the morning sunshine
A couple come and carry in a baby
Chorus
Now that I've held Him in my arms
My life can now come to an end
Let Your servant now depart in peace
Cause I've seen Your salvation
He's the Light of the Gentiles
And the glory of His people Israel
Marry and the baby come
And in her hand five shekels
The price to redeem her baby boy
The baby softly cooing
Nestled in her arms
Simeon takes the boy and starts to sing
Chorus
Now's the time to take Him in your arms
Your life will never come to an end
He's the only way that you'll find peace
He'll give you salvation cause
He's the Light of the Gentiles
And the glory of His people Israel"

We were told, to assemble, to meet up at 10,
I was 12 and naive,
You planned out our route
I sat in your car, my suitcase in the boot,
On the M1, and the A1, until we reached Dover,
Through passport control, you pulled your car over
On the liner, we stood on the deck, we left port,
My first time abroad,
A school trip to Fance,
Well fancy that,
A weekend away to parle Francais,
Well fancy that
 
We found the hotel, checked in to a room and unpacked,
It had been a long day, you said ""let's hit the sack"",
As I changed, I could feel your eyes watching me,
I crept into bed, you pretended to read,
The lights went out, I fell asleep,
Woke up with a shock, and your hands on me,
I couldn't shout, I couldn't scream,
Let me out, let me dream,
I turned onto my side,
I laid there and cried,
On my first night in France,
Well fancy that,
You terrified me, I just wanted to sleep
Well fancy that
 
Morning came, light shined through,
I left France, I arrived home,
The hedge that you dragged me through
led to a nervous breakdown,
If I could have read, what was going on inside your head,
I would have said, but I was blind to your devious mind,
There's no excuse, for child abuse, and the scars that it leaves,
Where do you draw the line,
On school trips to France,
Well fancy that
you had a good time
turned sex into crime

That really kicks 'em in the

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating

But the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating

That really really drives 'em wild

Hoping it will come to an end,
The sword and the flame, the reflection of pain
And no time to stand and defend,
Steel crossing steel, thrashing wheel,
Now with the power and might,
We know it's alright, stand and unite,
This time we're ready to fight.

And now the battle is over,
Count the cost,
Move the dead, clean up the debris,
So we see what we've lost,
Get all the women and children,

A sacrifice so spotless and clean
To take all your sin away

The questioning voice
And the innocent eyes
Is the son of laughter who you've waited for
To die like a lamb 
To please the LORD

An accepted choice
A rush of wind
And an angel's voice
A ram in the thicket
Caught by his horns
And a new age of trusting the Lord is born

I was movin' up an old dusty road,
I wasn't botherin' nobody, I wasn't botherin' a soul.
I saw a woman's picture on a wanted sign,
She had the face of an angel and the eyes of a child.
So I moved a little closer, just to dig her face,
I wondered why was it hangin' now, in this lonely place?

There was fine threads hangin' beneath her face, like clothes hangin' on a line.
I said watch out man, 'cause this pretty girl is guilty of an awful crime.
She'll take your love, she'll stand you up, she'll make you feel ten feet tall.
She cuts you down, you hit the ground, you and your heart of gold.

They call her the love, the love rustler, yeah.
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love,
Love rustler, ooh yeah.

So I moved on up, on in to town, just to see if this rustler, if she could be found.
Well lo' and behold, to my surprise, she laid a kiss on me, hotter than a brandin' iron.
She came on tough, and she came on strong,
She cowtied my soul, now I can't leave here alone.

And when she told me to buck, I bucked, she told me to moo, I mooed.
When she told to jump, I jumped, she told me to woo, I wooed.
She ran her spurs into my mind, she rode me in to the ground.
If I had the will or strength, I'd crawl on out of town.

They call her the love, love, the love rustler. Oh yeah!
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love,
Love rustler, oh yeah!
They call her the love, love, love, love, love, love,love, love,
Love rustler, oooh!

Oh, the love, the love rustler .... do you feel alright? oh yeah
....Yippy yi yi yi, oh yeah....
C'mon baby, c'mon baby .... Lay that kiss on me now, lay that kiss on me right now,
Whoo! It feels so good! It feels so good!
I'm talkin' 'bout love, love, love - Love, love, love -
I'm talkin' 'bout love, yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout love, yeah!.
I'm talkin' 'bout love, ooh, yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout love, ooh, yeah! Alright.
The love rustler! The love rustler!
She runs her spurs into my mind. I just can't leave her behind.
She makes me feel like - ooh! - she makes me feel like ridin' off into the sunset -
yippie-yi-yi-yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi - yi. Oh yeah!
Ooh! She's so rude! She's so rude! And I'm in the mood for something rude!"

Than bacon &amp; lettuce &amp; homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin' out in the garden

Get you a ripe one don't get a hard one
Plant 'em in the spring eat 'em in the summer
All winter with out 'em's a culinary bummer
I forget all about the sweatin' &amp; diggin'
Everytime I go out &amp; pick me a big one

Homegrown tomatoes homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes
Only two things that money can't buy
That's true love &amp; homegrown tomatoes

You can go out to eat &amp; that's for sure
But it's nothin' a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your very own tomato juice
Eat 'em with egss, eat 'em with gravy
Eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the site put 'em in the middle
Put a homegrown tomato on a hotcake griddle

If I's to change this life I lead
I'd be Johnny Tomato Seed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes in every yard you see
When I die don't bury me
In a box in a cemetary
Out in the garden would be much better
I could be pushin' up homegrown tomatoes"

Two names scratched in every spray

And I've been on a desolate cliff

He sits down and finds a message by the phone
Thinking back to what he said to her last night
It's not worth it he'll give up without a fight

She captured the spirit, she gave him hope
Without her comfort he cannot cope
Looks at the message, tears it in two
Looks at the phone now he ought to...

She is busy turning letters into type
It's not easy doing things that you don't like
Turns to thinking in her morning coffee break
Should she call him hopefully it's not too late

She can't show her feelings but she can't hide
Can't hide emotions - it wouldn't do
All of her family all of her friends
Could be her downfall could be the end

He gets bored and so he walks out to his car
He needs friends and he needs comfort of a bar
She is lying in her bedroom semi-dressed
Reads a book to stop herself from being depressed

He drives through the night and he parks his car
Drinks to forget her, he goes too far
She shuts her book and turns out the light
He's found another bed for the night"

Don't let the river run dry
I'm sitting at...
I'm sitting at the wheel

Like a voyeur standing at the edge of time
Looking for a reason
It's got no rhyme
Love took a corner
Shot off for a mile
I'm sitting at the wheel
Rock on, Rocker!


I can hear the music playing 
I can hear the word that you're saying 
I can see the lovelife in your eyes 
Ain't no use in looking for an answer
I might find out
That it could be a disaster
Hold on to your own time
Don't let go
Don't let go

I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll
Roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry
I sitting at...
I'm sitting at the wheel


I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll 
Roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry

I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll
Rock and roll on by
Sitting at the wheel 
I'm just sitting
I'm sitting at the wheel
I'm sitting at the wheel

I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll by
Rock and Roll on by
Sitting at the wheel
I'm just sitting
Sitting at the wheel

If you're sitting at the wheel
Watch this rocker roll by"

A tender kiss that had to be
Always the same
Look who's falling in love again
The night isn't angry with me

Our beating hearts, two distant stars
A lovely way to say we are
No need to fall
What's less than love just isn't love at all
The night isn't angry with me

Then Sunday comes like it always comes
As Monday creeps up on you
A perfect day
For someone turning blue

Heavenly eyes that smile on me
The sweetest thing that's ever been
Always the same
Look who's falling in love"

Saw you dance like dice
And tumble to the floor

Like a looking-glass-girl
In a minature world
Whirl your Disney arms
And jump the merry-go-round

The umbrella man is shouting
We shake his paper hands
There's mirrors down beneath our feet so
""Let's skate down the street""

The casino man is laughing
He wears a shivering hat
We peel away like tinsel
Stick like splinters to the wall

Like a looking-glass-girl
In a minature world
She saw you dressed in rags
In-and-out of a Jack-in-a-box

Because she's a looking-glass-girl
In a minature world
Whirl your see-saw arms
And ride the catherine wheel

Si no naciste con clave... entonces no eres rumbero
Podrás cantar con sentido podrás tener buena voz
Pero ser rumbero nunca si te falta corazón

Para ser rumbero tienes que amar a la gente
Y tener el alma tan clara cual sol de oriente
Tú tienes que ser sincero...
Y entonces serás rumbero...

Of home and it's warming fire

And Home
Sings me of sweet things
My life there has it's own wings
To fly over the mountains
Though I'm standing still

The people I've seen
They come in between
The cities of tiring life
The trains come and go,
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

The headlights were bright.
But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend
The flowers will send
The sweet scene of home in the breeze

Has won the victory

Of what You'd come to give
To drink for us that crimson cup
So we might really live
At last the time to love and die
The dark appointed day
That one forsaken moment
When Your Father turned His face away

Was Satan's nail-pierced casualty

And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide
And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
Saying oh it's been so long you've spent so long on the sands
Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood
They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead

J'ai couru les filles
J'ai pris tout mon temps
J'ai accroché mon coeur
Aux épines de fleurs
Et j'ai gagné souvent

Ce soir, je pousse de ma canne
Les feuilles des platanes
Sous les bancs de ciment

Dans les odeurs de cigares
Et le bruit des guitares
De mes petits enfants

Je courais, je courais, je courais, je courais
Et le temps s'en allait
Je courais, je courais, je courais...

Et tout le temps que je passe
Assis à la même place
Juste à bouger les yeux

Avec mes vieilles rengaines
Et mon écharpe de laine
Même quand le ciel est tout bleu

Toujours la voix qui s'embrume
La crainte du rhume
Ou le bruit des avions

Et dans le froid qui s'approche
J'ai peur que les cloches
Chantent bientôt mon prénom

Je courais, je courais, je courais, je courais
Et le temps s'en allait
Je courais, je courais, je courais...

Toi, mon enfant que j'aime
Toi qui a tant de peine
Assieds-toi un moment

Quels que soient ceux qui te quittent
Dis-toi que le temps passe vite
Et que la poussière t'attend

Tu vois ces bras de misère
Ont fait le tour de la terre
Pour une fille de chez nous

Ils ont fait sauter les tables
Et des plages de sable
Et des hordes de loups

On était tellement bien
On était tellement loin
Qu'on était presque perdus

On était tellement haut
Et tellement beaux
Qu'on ne se reconnaît plus

Et le temps s'en allait
On courait, on courait, on courait

Ce matin j'ai joué aux billes
J'ai couru les filles
Et j'ai pris tout mon temps

J'ai accroché mon coeur
Aux épines de fleurs
Et j'ai gagné souvent

Ce soir, j'ai plus de problèmes
Tout le monde m'aime
Mais c'est pas pareil qu'avant

Parce qu'il y a le bout de ma canne
Les feuilles des platanes
Et c'est l'automne tout le temps

Toi mon enfant que j'aime..."

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,

and the nightfires burning and you're on your feet
all the boys and girls - look in their eye
domestication - lost overnight
games get bigger all the time
games get bigger all the time
because the playpens falling - stakes are high
and the child will conquer - step by step
let's play wild - volatile
fun and games come out to play
fun and games"
274,Ozzy Osbourne,Rock 'n' Roll Rebel,TRTUPEG128F426A69D,1983,"They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious
They hide behind the laws they make for all of us
The ministry of truth that deals with pretense
The ministry of peace that sits on defense
I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do
It's a me, It's a me, It's a you, It's a you

I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
They must be stupid or blind
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel

They live a life of fear and insecurity
And all you do is pay for their prosperity
The ministry of fear that won't let you live
The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive
Do what you will to try and make me conform
I'll make you wish that you had never been born

'Cause I'm a rock n' roll rebel
I'll do what I please
Yes I'm a rock n' roll rebel
And I'm as free as the breeze
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel

They'll try playin' with your hearts
They know it rules your head
If they could read between the lines
You know they'd see the real face

God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious
Is it because they manifest the incubus?
The ministry of war that got caught in the draft
The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed
When it's boiled down and the day's at an end
I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend

'Cause I'm a rock n' roll rebel
I'll tell you no lies
They say I worship the devil
Why don't they open their eyes?
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel
A rock n' roll rebel
I'm just a rock n' roll rebel"

There's somebody for everyone
There's a movie that you know
that makes you smile
Love ain't everything
But girl we should try it
for a while

My father told me it's okay
to be lonely
Just don't be taken for the fool

Let go and let it be ' cause

I'm eager to please

And I hand you the keys 
Every night I am burning
To make love to you

you think it's all physical

You ought to know

It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe 
It's an affair of the heart

When we make love
It's a passionate thing 
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin 
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands

And you got the power
It amazes me still 
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill 
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me
You think it's just physical 
It goes way deeper than that

All the panic I can muster,
Threatening to the cluster"";

When it gets too far out.


Guard the ribs and fall,
I long to catch my breath, condemm it all

They count me out a volunteer.

See how they run in silence up the belfry steps,
Each unaffected by the sight of the blistered skin;
Someone to calm me till the pounding in my head stops,
Over the tens of thousands find no way out of in:
Through the pandemonium, My heart is beating like a drum,
Barricaded in here, crawling's getting creepier,
With my head in my hands, all the heaven in my heart.

What you've bitten off 
But in the end, you spat me out

Too tough, too tough

Ah now I can see you
Across the room, the oldest ocean
It rolls and it flows
And there's a hush and a shimmer
And a rush and a glimmer
And a glide inside
And a glow...
And every move we make now
And every stop we take now
Is a new unknown
Put on your dress...
Now I put on my suit
Ah look
And you can't see me at all
I can step through any crowd
And me and my shadow
Well, we just dissolve
But there's always a secret light
And I can always find
Some kind of a private sign
A hidden music that stays
And it plays even when the town gets
Turned 'round at night
Put on your dress
Slow burning stars
Tumble across your shoulders
Oh take your time now
You know you always take my breath
Put out the light
Ah now we can see more clearly than ever
I think we're drifting at the edge of the world
You turn around and smile
And there's nothing left
No no no there's nothing left
Put on your dress..."

Don't be swayed and shell shocked

There is only waving
Men's are misbehaving
Jackie's on the craving
Rabbits on the raving
Their on the way with a tooth force
hella frat while the cats gone
Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet
Hello hello

Stand outside the door frame
Enter at your own game
Horse is trapped and ignorant
Of course, you'll wont get in here
Zelda is only waving
Doesn't worth your saving
Mine is trapped in a cave in
Monday feels like a slave in
Zelda is waving with her two hands
Freddy's is making up a new band

Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet


Hello hello

I can't explain
again and again
ain't you afraid
again and again

Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet
Hello hello

When we meet with a genius
You know he's never really seen us
He's come back to brandy
Well that's  very handy
Zelda's on the way man
To raise his kids, it's just amazing
Keith has joined the navy
Roger's little baby
Zelda screams not to touch her
But one day someone will f**k her

In the evening of the day

Lay this body down

Will meet on that day

sulle mie guerre di pensieri.
La luce sembrava morire
dentro ai miei pugni di sognatore
la luce sembrava morire
dentro ai miei pugni di sognatore
cercai di andarmene di là
cercai di andarmene di là
di arrivare in una terra
con campi zeppi di viole
di sdraiarmi in una terra
con cieli immensi di sole
dove gli stomaci sono pieni
dove i ricordi sono sereni.
Andai la neve cadeva
avevo un groppo in gola
andai la neve cadeva
avevo il cuore in gola
una impotente necessità
una assoluta inutilità.
Nostalgia di un fiore
che cosa terribile
nostalgia di un fiore
che cosa terribile

apro la bocca e rido
per trattenermi dal pianto
apro la bocca e rido."

A helplessness, a nothing-left-to-prove?
A silence more eloquent than any passion?
It's a labour of love I offer to you
It's a labour of love
It's a gift of love

Take this hand and you will hold its stories
Beat, the heart, and find the tell-tale truth
Take this gift: receipt will give it value

It's a labour of love
It's a gift of love"

Fiori di bosco stasera non esco con voi. 

Strade di notte il mio cuore che batte 
Storia già fatta ma tu sei distratta e un po' mia, sei mia. 
Se sapessi com'è grande il mare, 
Il mare stanotte fa sognare. 

E' una notte che vola via se solo chiudo gli occhi, 
E' una stella che vola via ti amo e non basta, ma resta, mi basta. 

E' una notte che vola via da immaginare tutto, 
Sei dentro il mio cuscino, ti amo 

Mondo in vetrina io resto in cantina 
Ladro di sensi e di sentimenti per lei. 

Vento di notte è un cuore che batte 
Storia banale ma tu non sei male e un po' mia, sei mia. 
Se sapessi com'è grande il cielo, il cielo stanotte è un velo. 

E' una notte che vola via se solo chiudo gli occhi, 
E' una stella che vola via ti amo e non basta, ma resta, mi basta. 

E' una notte che vola via da immaginare tutto, 
Sei dentro il mio cuscino, ti amo 

Amo e non basta, ma resta, mi basta. 

E' una notte che vola via da innamorare tutto, 
Per te che sei lontano, ti amo 
Le tue promesse
No, no, no
Sempre le stesse
No, no, no
E poi non posso adesso,
Adesso, adesso non potrei.

It's a happy laughter of the free
It's a truth and it's a dare
It's a feeling in the air
It's a mother's love for a child
It's a burst from someone else's universe
It's something you carry with you like a curse
It's a smile or a tear
It's a treasured souvenir
It's a cue that makes the heart sing
And an argument has nowhere to go
And you'll grow old before you know
And the memories shine clear like looking in a mirror
And you remember all the times you were sincere
And the mood will hit you, you'll be a baby again
It will take and embrace you like an old friend
Adventure in your eyes with manic surprise
Like the sun shining through the clouds

Let's fall to pieces together
Right here in each other's arms

Alone is much better together
When the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest of  the tears that are left
From two hearts that just came undone

Is crying in some avenue

Is taking his aim
To target his rival
And tossing the street

The stakes of survival

The sidewalks are scattered

Walking down highways
Just seeing things my way
While dealer man enjoys his wealth
You spare the rope he'll hang himself

When children have the upper hand

Crying quietly like a fool

Did all the things they asked you to do
They say that home is where the heart is
But home is only where the hurt is
Pull the wool over the eyes
Forget the worries that you started

Mother loves to be concerned
Using lessons that she learnt
Fathers never understand
When children have the upper hand

When you stayed out every night
The first time from your parent's sight
They started to show some concern
But by then it was too late
Feel it's time to pull away
Shut your ears to all they say
Be yourself you know it's true
When in the end what's left is you

If I just get through this fall

Don't you know there's no place on this earth
Where you can run to escape the pain of a broken heart
It's useless to spend the time it takes you try
But can't you see that I'm here
And I'm looking just the same
And I don't know why...

I could be a movie star
The king of Hollywood
Make them cry, dramatically pretending
To keep romance alive
And I would humbly thank my director
And everyone involved from the start
I could blow them all away
If I'd only find the the part
If I just get through this night
If I just get through this night"

And I'm not going back to work

This city stinks
Smell the power, smell the health
Smell the poverty of Americas wealth
Money smells of evil, greed
Capitolist wants and pumped up needs

Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks

Smell the logic... Smell the jet planes
The dangerous goals and crooked aims
Smell the progress... Smell the dirty money
Smells like shit, this isn't funny

Money stinks
Money stinks
This city stinks

Nobody cares about the air we breath
Nobody cares about the air we need
Smell the profit, smell the success
Smell the dying dream of the mighty west
Smell the factories, smell all the cars
The adult book stores and the topless bars
Smell the pretty people, smell their false pity
Smell the broken promise of the living city
Smell the real reason, smell, smell the one way plan
The real estate, the desperate, state of modern man
Smell the excess, smell the death
Smell the wet dream of this human mess"

Putting yourself into a role 
Putting yourself into a situation 

You never be in 
You never be in 
You never be in 
Being somebody else 
Being nobody 

I, I believe in heaven 
I, I believe in Hell 
Believe in water 
Believe in fire 
Helping old people cross the street 
And leave them alone in the gutter 
Weak as water 
Soft a butter 
Soft as butter

318,Fun Boy Three,The More I See (The Less I Believe),TRDHYKI128F92F6E1C,1983,"The more that I see, the less I believe
The barbed wire fences have replaced all the trees
The houses of God are full of sinners every week
Praying for forgiveness for those they leave to bleed

And they keep telling me, it's not my concern
But when petrol bombs fly, when cars overturn
When your see children cry because the cities are burning
Who's gonna show concern

Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Close your eyes but it won't go away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)

But the more that I see, the less I believe
Like countries split in two through religion, tradition, and greed
The devil's passed his hand those who have soultions
And those like me too ignorant to find my own conclusions

Is that what they're telling me, it's not my concern
But when I see children crying 'cause that's all they can do
They are crying for help and they're looking at you
What are you supposed to do?

Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Close your eyes but it won't go away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)

The governing powers are confused, the armies becoming bemused
Another bomb becomes defused and the terrorists aren't amused
Paisley is getting his shirt off, Sein Fien are going insane
They strike to divide the countryside but the borderline remains

Another attack leaves a widow in black, grieving for brereaved
Another kid with a brick gets shot in the back and gets left on the pavement to bleed
And they keep telling me, it's not my concern
It's not my concern, it's not my concern

Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Close your eyes but it won't go away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast)
Belfast's only half an hour away (Belfast's only half an hour away)

I try to hide
I'm listening to my voice inside
What's on to tell me right or wrong
I need to know where I belong
For all the days I ran away
I never dare to ask me who could I be
Who can bring back the love that's inside me

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could It be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you

Too many things said and done
Sure if you could be the one
To dry the tears I left behind
To chase these demons off my mind

I see your face
Touch your skin
Is this a fight
We both can't win
Sometimes the truth is miles apart
But it's hard to break your heart

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could It be you
Or do I break away
So leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true I don't have a clue
Could it be you

Baby i don't wanna waste your love
Though it's hard to just walk on
Well will this hurt be neverending
Where do I belong

Could it be you
Or do I lose my way
I'm here but colorblind
Could it be you
Or do I break away
Just to leave the past behind
I only wanna feel the sunlight stop the fight and see it in your eyes
Wish I just knew what I should do
Could it be you
Somebody tell me if it's true i don't have a clue
Could it be you

Used to plan to see that it's you
For everything I am everything I need lies in you"

From waterfalls I hear romantic calls
Feather in a ray of sunlight

Open your mind and you will see

And there's no room for secrecy
Your world is changing faster everyday
And there's no truth in what they say

Two by two

Life in a world of love and truth

But when you looked at me, I turned away
And I remember when you first spoke to me
You told me you didn't want to live life day to day

And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die
And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die

You seemed so confused you could never decide
If there was a problem you'd just run away and hide
We seemed to agree there was no solution in suicide
So why'd you feel compelled to go and take your life?

And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die
And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die

Did you wanna die?
Did you wanna die?

I never understood how you could end that way
But i hadn't see you much before the final day
I will always remember you took your life
And when you looked for me, I was out of sight

And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die
And I could see, if not for me you didn't have to die

E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei

I know I don't get there often enough
But God knows I surely try
It's a magic kind of medicine
That no doctor could prescribe

I used to rule my world from a pay phone
And ships out on the sea
But now times are rough
And I got too much stuff
Can't explain the likes of me

But there's this one particular harbour
So far but yet so near
Where I see the days as they fade away
And finally disappear

But now I think about the good times
Down in the Caribbean sunshine
In my younger days I was so bad
Laughin' about all the fun we had

I've seen enough to feel the world spin
Mixin' different oceans meetin' cousins
Listen to the drummers and the night sounds
Listen to the singers make the world go 'round

Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei

Lakes below the mountains
Flow into the sea
Like oils applied to canvas
They permeate through me

And there's that one particular harbour
Sheltered from the wind
Where the children play on the shore each day
And all are safe within

Most mysterious calling harbour
So far but yet so near
I can see the day when my hair's full gray
And I finally disappear

323,The Glove,Like An Animal,TRGVMFM128F147B289,1983,"One mile in the air that's where she lives
Her body looks so thin and pink and small
Dropping eggs from nervous shaking hands
And swallowing her fingers as they fall

Two people dance on the edge
Three of us push them away
There's nowhere to go
We're all in this
But nothing can hurt us at all

Fight her all you want you'll never win
Couldn't we just once leave her in bed
Let the dry air cut her happy throat
Hide her heart and lose her happy head

First I was a murderer then I was a saint
Now I live on stolen time
Twist and run like paint
Like an animal

Tuesday in the sun
Nothing could be worse
Not now not ever not anymore..."

You live in the hills
You invite all company
When you check it in the new spying glass
They want to know all your business

You live in the city
You mind your own business
What you see you don't see

They never mind their own business

An engagement ring
So you and Johnny are engaged ah

His a mighty lucky guy
He should be proud to have a woman like you
Listen
I've got something i wanna tell you
Don't think i'm getting pressured or anything like that
But this thing being bugging me for a long time now
And its getting heavier heavier each and everyday
And i just need to get it off my chest
I've never seen anybody like you
I've never known anybody like you

Chrs 
Guilty , guilty of loving you

Let me take you back to my child hood
We had a medium sized family you know
We weren't rich but my mother
She tried to bring us up the best she could

Chrs 
Guilty, guilty of loving you

To commit no crime or anything 
But i had to wait until i reached my goal
To commit this crime
According to their code of love..if there is
See love is a thing that
Well you know
Its a bit like quicksand
The more you wiggle
The Deeper you sink
And when it hits 
You'll just have to fall
Thats why i do believe
That I'm guilty

Said I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you(2x)"

Is by trism

To be home by sunset
Gotta be home by sunset

She asked me to give her a ride
She said she had to go
Dropped her off by the trism
Through the atmosphere by prism

Go trism
Go trism
Go trism
Go trism
Go trism

Gotta keep, gotta keep movin' on
Gotta keep movin'
Gotta keep movin'
Gotta keep movin'

She bends herself through the trism

In the smokey streets of the night
She pulls the lever and then bright light

I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars

I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way

Loves me better than you

First you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

I go walking in the night,
Memories of times gone by,
Ain't no way to put it right,
You tell me that you're lonely girl,
You say I was wrong,
Baby that was yesterday,
Now yesterday's gone.

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain
Remember the years darling, remember my name
And love is a game honey, that none of us won
I just walk away now, the show must go on.

Yesterday's gone, the show must gone
I guess I was wrong.

The good times that we shared together,
Making love by candlelight,
Then we went through stormy weather,
And I guess we lost the fight,
So write another lover's song,
And drink some more wine,
Cause when the rain starts falling down,
The sun always shines.

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain
Remember the years darling, remember my name
And love is a game honey, that none of us won
I just walk away now, the show must go on.

Yesterday's gone, the show must gone
I guess I was wrong.

Up and down the boulevard,
I go walking in the night,
Say goodbye to yesterday,
And leave it behind,
So once more we feel in darkly,
Kiss me again,
Darkly again my baby,
Cause this is the end.

Hold back the tears honey, just hold back the pain
Remember the years darling, remember my name
And love is a game honey, that none of us won
I just walk away now, the show must go on.

Yesterday's gone, say goodbye to yesterday,
So once more we feel it darkly, kiss me again."
