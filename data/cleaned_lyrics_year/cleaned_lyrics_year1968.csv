0,Jefferson Airplane,The House At Pooneil Corners,TRMASMO128F425C28D,1968,"You and me we keep walkin' around and we see
All the bulsht around us
You try and keep your mind on what's going down
Can't help but see the rhinocerous around us
And you wonder what you can do
And you do what you can
To get bald and hi 
And you know I'm still goin' need you around
You say it's healing but nobody's feeling it
Somebody's dealing - somebody's stealing it
You say you don't see and you don't
You say you won't know and you won't let it come
Everything someday will be gone except silence
Earth will be quiet again
Seas from clouds will wash off the ashed of violence
Left as the memory of men
There will be no survivor my friend
Suddenly everyone will look surprised
Stars spinning wheels in the skies
Sun is scrambled in their eyes
While the moon circles like a vulture
Someone stood at a window and cried
'One tear I thought that should stop a war
But someone is killing me'
And that's the last hour to think anymore
Jelly and juice and bubbles - bubbles on the floor
Castles on the cliffs vanish
Cliffs like heaps of rubbish
Seen from the stars hour by hour
As splintered scraps and black powder
From here to heaven is a scar
Dead center - deep as death
All the idiots have left
Epitaph
The cows are almost cooing
Turtle doves are mooing
Which is why a poo is pooing
In the sun
Sun."
1,Enzo Jannacci,Giovanni Telegrafista,TRJOGQK128F42A6C5E,1968,"Piripiripiri...Piripiripiri... 
Giovanni telegrafista e nulla pi√π,
Stazioncina povera c'erano piu' alberi e uccelli che persone
Ma aveva il cuore urgente anche senza nessuna promozione
Battendo, battendo su un tasto solo.
Piripiri...
Elittico da buon telegrafista, 
Tagliando fiori, preposizioni
Per accorciar parole, per essere piu' breve 
Nella necessita', nella necessita'.
Conobbe Alba, un Alba poco alba,
Neppure mattiniera, anzi mulatta
Che un giorno fuggi unico giorno in cui fu mattutina
Per andare abitare citta' grande piena luci gioielli.
Piripiripiri.... 
Storia viva e urgente.
Ah, inutili tanto alfabeto morse in mano 
Giovanni telegrafista
Cercare cercare Alba ogni luogo provvisto telegrafo.
Ah, quando l'invecchia cum est morosa urgenza 
Giovanni telegrafista e nulla piu'... urgente.
Piripiri...
Per le sue mani passo mondo, mondo che lo rese urgente,
Crittografico, rapido, cifrato, 
Passo' prezzo caffe' passo' matrimonio Edoardo ottavo 
Oggi duca di Windsor, 
Passarono cavallette in Cina, 
Passo' sensazione di una bomba volante,
Passarono molte cose ma tra l'altro 
Passo notizia matrimonio Alba con altro.
Piripiri....
Giovanni telegrafista, quello dal cuore urgente, 
Non disse parola, solo le rondini nere 
Senza la minima intenzione simbolica
Si fermarono sul singhiozzo telegrafico 
Alba e' urgente.
Piripiri...Piripiri..."

I've got tears in my eyes,
Tryin' to read this letter from my home.
If this train runs me right
I'll be home tomorrow night.
'Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home.
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow.

The rain that I'm on
Is a thousand coaches long.
You can hear that whistle blow a hundred miles.
If this train runs me right
I'll be home tomorrow night.
I'm nine hundred miles from my home.
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow.

I'll pawn you my watch
And I'll pawn you my chain;
Pawn you my diamond golden ring.
If this train runs me right
I'll be home tomorrow night.
I'm nine hundred miles from my home.
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow.

If my woman says me so

I'm nine hundred miles from my home.
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow."

Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk, you know we've got to leave today

Oh oh yes the sweetness today has gone sour

9,Steppenwolf,A Girl I Knew,TREZDZT128F4215DE3,1968,"She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter

A girl I knew
Someone I used to talk to
When we'd meet in the middle of a room
A girl I knew
Her world a shade of blue
Someone I used to talk to

She used to sing in the night while her ring
It would sparkle like burgundy wine
And the people stopped and starred but pretend she's not there

She used to dance when she had the chance and the time it didn't matter
At the end of her night was an endless flight
While her head, it was lost in the laughter"

12,New Trolls,Ho Veduto,TRAXAAU128F429721D,1968,"Ho veduto nascere il sole dai ghiacci di Thule
Ho veduto i riflessi dorati delle moschee
Le onde adulte della Guascogna, gli squali bianchi
I tucul, le case dei ricchi e ho pianto.

Ho veduto mare che √® mare terra che √® terra
Come in me, come a Lisbona , come da noi.
Ho veduto grano che √® grano, fango che √® fango
Ho ascoltato il linguaggio del mondo e ho pianto.

Ho visto amare
Fremere, ansare

Ho veduto la faccia sporca di un amico
Lo stupore di una pazzia, di una morte
Ho veduto l'ironica faccia di chi mi odia
Gli occhi larghi di chi ha paura e ho pianto.

Ho perdona
Giustificato

Ho veduto morire il sole nel golfo di Aden
Ho veduto il buio e la luce e ancora piango."

And you are in the eye 
There ain't no movement 
Things that could die 
But the reelin' and the spinnin' 
Of the rock and roll sides 
Will all be gone before midnight 
And die before sunrise 

You better go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive 
If you know what it is 
And you wanna stay alive 
You better go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive 

Yes, the corner's full of monkeys 
And your ear drum's full of lies 
Time is out the window 
And there's echoes in your sides 
They've been burnin' down your walls 
Ever since the peep of dawn 
And now the dealer's in the fireplace 
Tryin' to turn it on 

You better go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive 
If you know that it's time 
And you oughtta take a dive 
You better go to overdrive

Go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive 
You know what it is 
And you wanna stay alive 
You better go to overdrive

Cause he knows your overdue 
But it's just another train ride 
Bein' all the same to you 
And the last shot's at your finger tips 
Like that flicker in the grass 
And the last cord hits the ashes 
And you know you gotta pass 

You better go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive 
If you know that it's time 
And you oughtta take a dive 
You better go to overdrive 
Go to overdrive"

15,The Association,Time For Livin' (Album Version),TRFHSUD128F147B74B,1968,"I kicked off my shoes, and felt the good earth beneath my feet
I loosened my tie, and felt what it feels like to breathe
I found the secret to llife
I took some time for living
I took off my watch, and found I had all the time in the world
I opened up my arms, so I could hold life like a beautiful girl
I laid down all of my hang-ups forever
I looked around, and saw what sweet things can be found
Simply by taking some time for living
Grooving on little things life is giving

From now on I'm taking time out for life
Too busy  to stop and notice the things that are real
Embarrassed to talk about all things that I feel
It's so strange, never noticed the world all around me
Hey, look I've changed, my attitude's been rearranged

From now on I'm taking some time for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
I'm gonna be taking time for life
Lifetime for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
Lifetime for living
Grooving on everything life is giving
Lifetime for living"
16,Jerry Jeff Walker,My Old Man ( LP Version ),TROJLIB128E078CEDA,1968,"My old man had a rounder soul 
He'd hear an ol' freight train and he'd have to go
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
And that's the reason I guess that he'd been cursed to roam
Came to town back before the war

Didn't even know what it was he was lookin' for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places he had been
He talked real easy and he smiled and waved
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played

Makin' people drop their cares and woes
And hum out loud the tunes that his fiddle bowed
Til the people there began to join that sound
And ev'ryone in town was laughin,' singin,' dancin' 'round
Like the Fiddler's tunes we all there heard that night
Like some dream that says all the world is right

Instrumental Break

The Fiddler's eye caught a beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin' golden kind of hair
He played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own
She alone was dancin' in the room
The only thing left movin' to that Fiddler's tune

Instrumental break

He played until she was the last to go
The he stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home
In all the nights that passed a child was born
In all the years that passed, love would keep them warm
And all their lives they'd share that dream come true
And all because she danced so well his fiddler tune

Instrumental break

The train next mornin' blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town
And all that I recall that was said when I was young
There's no one else could really sing those songs he sung"
17,Glen Campbell,Dreams Of The Everyday Housewife,TRTSOOJ128F930292A,1968,"She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way
She picks up her apron in little girl fashion as
Something comes into her mind
Then slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Ah such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet and
Slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the house dress
That suddenly disappears
And just for a moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Ah such are the dreams...

Ah such are the dreams...

Ah such are the dreams..."

You're a fine one Timer, you've got me walking through the gates of space.
I keep remembering indoors that I used to walk through,
baby, I'm not trying to talk you down.
But I could walk through them doors onto a pleasure ground.
It was sweet and funny, a pleasure ground.
Didn't know about money, did not know about Timer, did not know about Timer.

Holding to my cradle at the start but now my hand is open 
and now my hand is ready for my heart.
So let the wind blow Timer, I like her song.
And if the song goes minor, I won't mind.
And Timer knows the lady's gonna love again.
Time says the lady rambles never more.
If you love me true, I'll spend my life with you and Timer.

And called true love a crime (this is what killed me)

That they would find you guilty too

Judge, your honor and to the jury

And gathers all my sleep

My days are just an endless stream
Of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments
Of her memory

Sweet memories
Sweet memories

She slipped into the silence
Of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room
Turning on each light

Her laughter spills like water
From the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness
Clinging to her memories

Sweet memories
Sweet memories"
25,Simon & Garfunkel,Overs,TROFTVV128F932A0E0,1968,"Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?
The game is over
Over
Over

No good times, no bad times
There's no times at all
Just The New York Times
Sitting on the windowsill near the flowers

We might as well be apart
It hardly matters
We sleep separately

And drop a smile passing in the hall
But there's no laughs left 'cause we laughed them all
And we laughed them all
In a very short time

Time is tapping on my forehead
Hanging from my mirror
Rattling the teacups
And I wonder

How long can I delay?
We're just a habit like saccharin
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you

I stop
I stop and think it over"
26,Jerry Jeff Walker,Broken Toys ( LP Version ),TROLEGH128E078CED8,1968,"There's not much to say for what was mine today
But when tomorrow comes, I'll make my way
Had planned to build a dream or two today
But everything I tried turned out mistakes
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day

Casting nets catch dreams; try for what seems to be
Bend that willow round and shape things as I see
Finding that some cards are drifting in the sea
And no matter how I play them, they'll trick me
That was his day, tomorrow I'll be free

Today played unfair; left me hung up, nowhere
And though it tries to break me I don't care
Tried to bring my ship in tow to land somewhere
Today is just another chance that's left me there
Broken toys today, tomorrow's my repair

There's not much to say for what was mine today
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day"

Of every house
In every street
In every town
A story is unfolding
A story is unfolding
Of love and hate
Remorse, love's fate
Of hopes and fears
And smiles and tears
Of dreams that lie emoldering 
Behind the door
Of every house
In every street
In every town
The stage is set for playing
The stage is set for playing
And add tough crime
A pantomime
A sweet romance
A ritual dance
The characters are praying 
Behind the door
Of every house
In every street
In every town
The people are awaiting
The people are awaiting
To bear and die
The years go by
The wedding spree
The funeral tea
And still they go on waiting 
And to the one
The only one
Remembered when
The need of men
It's great again 
The passing cop?
A sand in?
Propelled with love
To the one above
Asking for
Asking for
Asking for
Asking for
A happy ending
A happy ending"

Why didn't I
Just walk away

I knew
All the love songs
Once upon a time he sang them
To me

I was crying in the sunshine
When someone said,
""Is something wrong?""
And I said no
It's just a song

Good ol' sympathy

I'm not the one
Tenderly bring her soft sympathy
I've just begun
To see my way clear
And it's plain,
If I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear for her pain
Just a tear and that's all

Oh , what does she want me to do? 
She says that she knows 
That moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
Then on she goes
To say I don't care,
Ah, she knows
That I do

Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong

She'd like to think I was cruel,
But she knows that's a lie
For I would be
No more than a tool
If I allowed her to cry
All over me.

Oh my sorrow is real
Even though
I can't change my plan
If she could see how I feel
Then I know
That she'd understand

Oh does she actually think I'm to blame? 
Does she really believe
That some word of mine
Could relieve
All her pain? 
Can't she see that she grieves
Just because she's been blindly deceived
By her shame? 

Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong

Oh but nothin's what it seems,
Maybe she'll start someday to realize
If she abandons her dreams,
Then all the words she can say are only lies
Why can't she see that to gain
Is only to lose? 
All that she offers me are her chains
And  I got to refuse

Oh but it's only to herself that she's lied
She likes to pretend
There's something that she should defend,
With her pride
And I don't intend
To stand her and be the friend
From whom she must hide

Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong"

Alarm bell rings, it will not stop
And I can see no end in sight
And search in vain by candlelight
For some long road that goes nowhere
For some signpost that is not there
And even my befuddled brain
Is shining brightly, quite insane

The chandelier is in full swing
As gifts for me the three kings bring
Of myrrh and frankincense, I'm told
And fat old Buddhas carved in gold
And though it seems they smile with glee
I know in truth they envy me
And watch as my befuddled brain
Shines on brightly quite insane

Above all else, confusion reigns
And though I ask, no one explains
My eunuch friend has been and gone
He said that I must soldier on
And though the ferris wheel spins 'round
My tongue it seems has run the ground
And croaks as my befuddled brain
Shines on brightly, quite insane

Shine on, hah, shine on, hah,  shine on...."

Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope
A cast out of Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's always lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sitting by my side

Wonder why he wants more if he just had some

Ladies eyes go off and on with a finger full of glue
Lips are drawn upon her face in come-to-me tattoo
Creamy suntan color that fades when she bathes
Paper dresses catch on fire &amp; you lose her in the haze
Don't ever change lady, he likes you that way because
He just had his hair done and he wants to use your wig
He's going off the drug thing cause his veins are getting big
He wants to sell his paintings but the market is slow
They're only paying him two grams now for a one-man abstract show
Don't ever change people even if you can
You are your own best toy to play with remote control hands
Made for each other made in Japan
Woman with a greasy heart automatic man
Don't ever change people your face will hit the fan
Don't ever change people even if you can
Don't change before the empire falls

What can I give you
What would make you happy
What can I do
What can I say
To make the bad times go away

It's been a long, long time
Since I've seen you smile
And I've been wanting
To do something about it
For a long, real long while

What can I give you
To drive away the sadness
What can I buy
What can I try
Tell me what I can do

It's been a long, long time
And you know I knew you
When you used to be happy
What can I give you
To make you happy again

E ti accorgerai che √© tornato tra noi 
Quell'amore che 
C'era una volta 
Quell'amore che 
Voglio per me. 
Vola il tempo e ti accorgi che 
Qualche cosa √© cambiato in te 
Senti il sole che ora scalda di pi√π.

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did

I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death

You didn't have to squeeze me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me but you did
But you did but you did

You pull out your bag and your fine to-do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you

Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about

You can fall through a hole in the ground

And there ain't no time like the time that you're wasting

To return all the odds that you lay

Sent you to the finest school
Never let it be said
That their little darlin' was a fool

So, with a credit card in your good name
You were drawn like a moth to the flame
To the people of the night
Where you more or less lost your cool

You had 20/20 vision
And still you were walkin' 'round blind
Yes and whether right or wrong
I'd still tag along behind

But you're flyin' too high for me
And if this is how it's got to be
Then it's time to say
You go your way and I'll go mine

It's been a gas but I'm gonna have to pass
These are not people, no
These are not my people
And it looks like the end, my friend
Gotta get in the wind, my friend

You found yourself naked
In the world with no place to hide
Then you felt the pulse of your God
And He had died

Then your rebels that have got no cause
And your tigers that have got no claws
They promised you world on a string
But you know they lied

You know, you said you'd be back
In a black Cadillac limousine
But you know, I'm inclined to think
It's not the kind you mean

'Cause when you fall down from off your cloud
And you're just another face in the crowd
They're gonna throw you away
Like last week's magazines

It's been a gas but I'm gonna have to pass
These are not people, no, no
These are not my people
And it looks like the end, my friend

If I could only stay sixteen forever

All I want is wheatgerm for my breakfast
A Champagne fountain sizzling at my feet
While Rockefeller waiten on the table
And Lombardo's band playin' while I eat.

If I only owned Western Union cable
And if Tuesday Weld would only be my wife (Tiny, I love you!)
If I could only stay sixteen forever and ever and ever

Hello, my dear friend,
Don't run away from all this world,
It's a great big beautiful world
With fabulous happy faces around
Well, I can see this one over here, you lovely thing,
Why, it's beautiful, it's clean, and it's calm and it's modern,
If I can have them all, why, I'll tell you, I'll tell you

55,Jerry Reed,Today Is Mine,TRZDOYA12903CCA1AB,1968,"Today Is Mine
When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise.
As its beauty struck the darkness from the skies.
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be,
and how lucky another day belongs to me.
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day,
and all its silent beauty seemed to say:
So what, my friend, if all your dreams you haven't realized.
Look around, you got a whole new day to try. 
Today is mine, today is mine, to do with what I will.
Today is mine. My own special cup to fill.
To die a little that I might learn to live.
And take from life that I might learn to give.
Today is mine.
With all men I curse the present that seems void of peace of mind,
and race my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind.
But when I view the day around me I can see the fool I've been.
For today is the only garden we can tend.
Today is mine, today is mine, to do with what I will.
Today is mine. My own special cup to fill.
To die a little that I might learn to live.
And take from life that I might learn to give.
Today is mine."
56,The Monkees,Daddy's Song,TRUGVVG128F42391BB,1968,"Years ago I knew a man
He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he'd tell how my life would be
When I grew up to be a man
Years ago we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
But when I fell and hurt my knee
He used to come and comfort me
And the pain would go away

Years ago I knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy
But when the daddy went away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys
Now the momma did explain
Trying to take away the pain
He just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game

Years have passed and so have I
Making it hard to cry
And  if and when I have a son
Let it all be said and done
Let all that sadness pass him by"

Widows face the future.
Factories face the poor.
The fact remains the peril strains the mind a bit.
To have done and quit with it widows walk and wail among the willows.
Widows walk ado walk on.

I'm guessing this is called civil,
Regrettably strife.
So lessen your appalled pall mall and middle life.
Long last a hymn to Him to help you on your way.

Contented is the boat.
By chance how forlorn the shore.
I've meant to take the chance to turn you 'bout the floor so trim the prim the lame have rose to say widows walk and wail among the willows.

Wonderin' where in this world might you be
And known' all the time
Your still rollin' along the country side
Do you still think about me?

Oh my
Gypsy

Well I walked right on up to your rebel road side
The one that rambles on for a million miles
Yes I walked down this road searching for your love
And I found some too
But I found her  I ain't gonna let go

I remember the first time I saw you
The tears in your eyes oh that girl's tryin' to say
Oh little girl you know I could love you
But first I must make my getaway
Two strange men fightin' to the death over me today
I'll try and meet you by the old highway
Hey!

Well I realize that I've been hypnotized
I love you gypsy eyes
I love you gypsy eyes
I love you gypsy eyes
I love you gypsy eyes

I've been searching  so long
I think they made me lose the battle
Down against the road my worry knees
Off to the side I fall but I hear her sweet call
My gypsy eyes fine and I've been saved
Oh I've been saved
That's why I love you
I said I love you

""Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together""
""I've got some real estate here in my bag""
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America

""Kathy,"" I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
""Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've come to look for America""

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, ""Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera""

""Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat""
""We smoked the last one an hour ago""
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the Moon rose over an open field

""Kathy, I'm lost,"" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
""I'm empty and aching, and I don't know why""
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America

To only pass the time
No more electric trains

But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time 
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be 
A magic carpet ride

Feet propped up on the railin'
Sittin' in front of the country store
Discussin' how the crops were failin'

About that time a car drove by
With an Ace Insurance bumper sticker
Well that must be the man been courtin' Abell
He's somethin' of a city slicker
(Ah, you can tell just from the way he's drivin' that car)

Do you reckon he's goin' up to see Abell
You know her daddy went to Maben this day
And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa
Ain't nobody home that way

Now, I don't mean nothing by what I say

You remember 'bout Abby Mcguinness
Why'it, lik'ta kill'ed her ma when she found out about it
Course I know it ain't none of my bid'ness
But uh, well, if it was me, if it was me

It might be too late and it would be a pity
Better call up the sheriff in Calhoun city
And have the preacher organize a 'vestigating committee
To see what's going on
(Yes, sir, and we'd better hurry)

Tearing down the road in a pickup truck
With Bentley out taking the lead
Followed by a tractor and a half lame mule
Dust flyin' as they picked up speed

Faces beaming goodness and their jaw's set hard
Good people just doin' what's right
And off in the distance was Abell's house
And there wasn't a soul in sight
Aw, I could'a told you
(Oh, I just knew it)

Now the gravel was flying as he turned the bend
And screeched to a grinding halt
They went through the fence, into the flower bed
And hit pa's first-prize hog in the head
And left half a dozen mama's chickens for dead
But it wasn't nobody's fault

Oh, look at Harvey's prize hog
And all of them darlin' old grown bad trusty chickens
(We got more important things to tend to, boy)
I wonder if they're covered?

Committee bounded on the front porch
To meet the enemy face to face
But Abell yelled at 'em through the screen door
""Y'all messed up my daddy's place""

But in her hand she waved a policy
Sayin' with a Mona Lisa grin
""Well, y'all timed that one just about right
'Cause Ace done struck again"""

So let the sun shine bright

Arose to me
A shining star, she is by far
The most beautiful thing in my life

And when she gives me a smile or a touch
Who'd ever think little things mean so much

Yesterday belongs to someone else
Today belongs to me
I guess that it's my turn at last to know
How sweet that love can be

For the lovin' things, baby that we share

It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
Gonna want you my whole life through

Telling everyone about the way it shines
Barefoot boy is grinning like a fool
Doesn't really want to get her off his mind

Turn around the summer's almost over
Turn around the summer's almost gone

Barefoot girl is buying winter clothes
Packing everything she owns and rides away
Barefoot boy don't care to see her go
Would give anything if she would only stay

Turn around the summer's almost over
Turn around until the winter's gone

Midnight wind is blowing awfully hard
Racing all the trains down along the track
Barefoot boy is standing in the yard
Afraid to go and see the barefoot girl come back

Turn around the days are not so lonely
Turn around before the summer's gone
Turn around before the night is over
Turn around no need to be alone"

Tell her I'm in misery
And think she's avoiding me
And if the telegram don't do
Send a box of candy too
And maybe some flowers
Tell her that I missed her for hours and hours

Walk on through purple flowers. Breathe the golden fragrance.
You have reached the final island where dreams light up the daytime.
You are at the end of journey, all is peace.

Wine trickles down from mountains, crimson streamers floating.
Sweet meats hang from bushes and ripely cry for plucking.
Maidens gather flowers and feed you with soft fingers.
Hours are a song that never ends. Hours are a songt that never ends.

You can see love waiting inside the velvet cave.
She calls you from the meadow. Her eyes are brightly shining.
Her breasts are fruits she offers, so you leave the fields behind you.
To follow promises she will fulfill.  She will fulfill.

In the cave there's no tomorrow, nor any yesterday.
Just the hammer of her heartbeat as she draws you down beside her.
And you sink down on the pillow of her body hotly loving.
And you pray you'll never waken to the day.
And you pray you'll never waken to the day.

Never.

And I wanna be close to it all and all,

They try to escape from it all,
But instead they build walls, that's all
But they wanna be close to it all.

If I had my dream I would fill a hall
And tell all the people tear down the wall
That keeps them from being a part of it all
'Cause they gotta get close to it all.

That keeps them from getting too close to the day,
Accept and be part of it all and all;
Everyone tear down your own little wall
That keeps you from being a part of it all
'Cause you gotta be one with the one and all,

Words and Music by Margo Guryan



Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

121,Joan Baez,Song In The Blood,TRETPFA128F92F21A4,1968,"There are great puddles of blood on the world
Where is it all going? all this spilled blood?
Is it the earth that drinks it and gets drunk?
Funny kind of drunkography then, so wise, so monotonous, no,
The earth doesn't get drunk
The earth doesn't turn askew
It pushes its little car regularly, it's four seasons, rain, snow, hail, fair weather,
Never is it drunk
It's with difficulty it permits itself from time to time
An unhappy little volcano
It turns, the earth,
It turns with its trees, its gardens, its houses
It turns with its great pools of blood
And all living things turn with it and bleed

It doesn't give a damn the earth
It turns and all living things set up a howl,
It doesn't give a damn,
It turns
It doesn‚Äôt stop turning
And the blood doesn't stop running

Where's it going all this spilled blood?
Murder's blood, war's blood, misery's blood, 
And the blood of men tortured in prisons,
And the blood of children calmly tortured by their papa and their mama
And the blood of men whose heads bleed in padded cells
And the roofers blood when the roofer slips and falls from the roof
And the blood that comes and flows in great gushes with the newborn
The mother cries,
The baby cries,
The blood flows
The earth turns
The earth doesn‚Äôt stop turning,
The blood doesn‚Äôt stop flowing

Where's it going all this spilled blood?
Blood of the blackjacked,
Of the humiliated,
Of suicides
Of firing squad victims
Of the condemned
And the blood of those that die just like that by accident

In the street a living being goes by with all his blood inside
Suddenly there he is, dead
And all his blood outside
And other living beings make the blood disappear
They carry the body away
But it's stubborn the blood
And there where the dead one was, 
Much later, all black,
A little blood still stretches
Coagulated blood, 
Life's rust, body's rust
Blood curdled like milk, 
Like milk when it turns,
When it turns like the earth, 
Like the earth it turns with its milk, 
With its cows,
With its living, 
With its dead,
The earth that turns with its trees, 
With it's living beings, its houses
The earth that turns with marriages, 
Burials,
Shells, 
Regiments, 
The earth that turns and turns and turns
With its great streams of blood."

But her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

And I turned twenty-one in prison
Doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better
But her pleading, I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried"

Just look around and you will see
There's a little bit of everything in Texas
And a whole lot of Texas in me

There are forty nine states around there
And each of them have treasures of their own
And everything they boast of I sure found it
But we've got them all right here at home

If you love old sunny California
Or perhaps the hills of Tennessee
No matter what you love just come to Texas
And I'll bet my boots you will agree

There's a little bit of everything in Texas
And really I'm not bragging you see

Are shared at those moments with you
You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you
In the songs I've been singing, quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of a song would come true
You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you
You are of gracefulness, you are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of

But I've got feelings for you to hear
I've been travelling around for days
But sweet angels don't often appear

I saw you in the crowd
But I was not allowed to have you near
I was listening to your vioce
I heard your name was Caroline
But you had another man by your side
And I wished that you were mine

Precious hours went by
Before I had to try and leave you behind
Hills and rivers seperate us
And my words were all in vain
You were only my magic dream
Lightning flash in the falling rain
But wherever I may be
I wish that you could be with me again"

She had a million cattle and she had a million sheep
She had a million vessels in the ocean deep

Laugh with the wind in the cold end of night

John had it sussed he was living the life of a tramp

And shaking from behind their curtains the loved ones would hear."

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain."

It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

And look around you, leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again

Look around, the grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Ah, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime

And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

It's a real special occasion
Yeah, yeah
Special occasion, oh, oh yeah
Hmm hmm, yeah

Ooh, beautiful music begins to play
You are the sun
That brightens up my day
Why don't you stay
'Cause every time I'm with you

It's a real special occasion
Like when in school
You get your cap and gown
Yeah, now

It's a real special occasion
Every time you come around
Baby, it's a real special occasion"
152,Margo Guryan,Think Of Rain,TROSBAF12903CD45E7,1968,"Think of rain

Words and Music by Margo Guryan




If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain
Think of holding hands and running for cover
Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile

Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me
Think of rain
Think of rain
If one day you should think of leaving me

153,Percy Sledge,Take Time To Know Her,TRKIOIP128F933EE75,1968,"I found a woman
I felt I truly loved
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

I took her home to mama
Mama wanted to see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
And then she called me to her side

She said, ""Son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing""

But I didn't listen to mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait to have a little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both 
And then he called me to his side

He said, ""Son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
You better take time to know her
Please, please don't rush into this thing""

When it look like every thing was gonna turn out all right
And then I came home a little early one night
And there she was kissin' on another man

Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand
And said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing

Take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her"

Hurting me more and more

You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I

I love you,

Miss having you around
Makes these tears inside
Start falling down, well
Always with half a kiss
You remind me of what I miss
So I try to control myself
Like I'm gonna start fainting, cause my heart stops beating, cause I

I love you,
This old heart darling weeps for you (weeps for you)

The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're in for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it,
Tell the world about it, cause I

I love you

We used to live there on Vine Street.
She made perfume in the back of the room
And me and my group, we'd sit out on the stoop
And we'd play for her the songs she liked best
To have us play, on Vine Street.

Vine Street, the crack of the backbeat on Vinestreet.
Swingin' along on the wings of a song
And I'll lie in, secure, self-righteous, and sure
Why we've things to say that the people would pay to hear us play, on Vine Street."

166,Jerry Jeff Walker,The Ballad Of The Hulk ( LP Version ),TRTUCEK128E078CED9,1968,"The cycle of life is here 
To see in all of its fine simplicity
But the way we live it seems to be, 
Something very weird to me
And I cry out

For pettiness like lady's chatter 
Seems to complicate the matter
I grit my teeth as my senses chatter 
For nothing gets me much madder
As I leap out

For big or little, great or small, 
It really doesn't matter at all
The way we shuffle our feet and hem and haw, 
'Cause everybody's afraid they'll fall
Or else be left out

But what's right for me or strange to you 
Shouldn't make a damn on what you do
'Cause whether or not you make it through, 
I thought that you already knew
That I'll keep you going

And the World War III and the World Series
Will make the same size headlines in the news

From all I've seen of politics, 
It's just a greasy big money stick
That's geared to run on tongues 
So slick to make you think this is all there is
Boy you're lucky (You're stuck with Humphrey)

How they con the little middle man 
Into thinkin' he has got a hand
To play in the future of the Promised Land, 
he owes himself to the destiny of man
Gets ridiculous

A cheap gangster hires someone
To do his dirty work with a tommy gun
While the President just points at anyone 
And says ""I, your country needs some killing done
Go do it now boy""

The war itself is bad enough, 
It can break you down no matter how tough
But the tragedy of all the hoopla stuff, 
It makes you think you can't do enough
For the shiny symbols

And the other countries feel the same as we
And regret that I have but one country to give for my life

The preacher stands in his holy shroud sayin' 
""God forgives you if you do it now""
But if you come back when the chips are down, 
You'll find they've all gone underground
To pray for you

A homosexual, disturbed priest feels that he can preach to me
The right way to go and raise a family 
And I'm forced to look at him and say ""you mean
You're guessin""

The population is getting higher, 
The poverty poor, the pregnant tired
Are waiting on the Pope to be inspired 
For some new contraceptive attire
Saying ""It's cool now""

It's a ghost behind a one-way mirror 
Listening tip-toed at the door to hear
If someone outside won't speak the year 
Then they'll slip a note out how they feel
About pierced ear-lobes

But the rules made now 
For the changing cows
Are a little late 
And will be out of date by tomorrow

Her mother placed on virginity 
Saying it was the holy place to be
For the things boys had were evilry 
When it came time for matrimony
She froze and died there

Her sister at fourteen very well known thought all the kicks came lying there prone
But a fundamental fact not spoken at home left her feeling like a chewed on bone
And why she wondered

One chick who dug moving about, very liberal minded and often spoke out
How she was cool and understood no doubt with the blankets up and the lights turned out
And you're condescending

A couple together for five or six years, 
A marriage license they'd never been near
But social pressure and loss of job fear 
Got them married and divorced in half a year
They couldn't cut it

It's all talked about 
But still it's lived around
And what is right for me 
Could be perversity in any state law book

I'm told a minstrel at one time w
As allowed to sing and make his rhymes
To comment on the news of the times 
And say directly what's in people's minds
And he made tips for it

But today try playing on some street curb, 
Singin' the news in everyday words
The people pass by, the laughin' is heard 
Or else they hit you where it hurts
They keep their ears closed

One man said ""Boy, I dig your stuff, 
I want you to come play in my club
I'll put your name in lights up above,
But just remember I got a club to run
So don't be too strong""

It ain't your writers who sell out, 
It's the damn censors who turn about
My life learned adjectives and vowels 
And say that my mouth is much too foul
To clearly speak to you

But try to hit a nail and if the hammer fails
Then the words you use to describe 
That bruise is basic language

I hoboed around and sang the songs 
That everybody knew and hummed along
To amuse myself I wrote some songs, talkin' 
About things that could be right or wrong
And I'm a little different

A record company you know well wanted to know if my song would sell
I said, ""Yes, I like it very well, 
If you don't sir, you can go to help""
Somebody else change

So I kept playin' and bummin' around, singin' 
To the ones who dug my sound
Some guys ask ""Won't you play my town"", 
I ask fair bread they put me down
Their Caddie's mortgaged

Tried one deal, like ""it's you and me"",
This guy said he could be of some use to me
But when I found he's puttin' screws to me,
I tipped my hat and made it back to the street
Singin' new folk songs

If there's time enough, 
The hill ain't too rough
What I wrote today, 
I might someday play, 
And make tips for it"

I change out my dark-grey mohair suit, pull on my dirty jeans,
The band comes round to pick me up, I holler: ""Hello boys,
I gotta mess my hair up and gotta make some noise.""

Can blue men sing the whites?
Or are they hypocrites for singing: Whooo ooo oooH,

Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to do you a little number now that's been very lucky for us from during the depression when everybody was very depressed.

Take this place
On this trip
Just for me

Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat
It's for free

I worked like a slave for years
Sweat so hard just to end my fears
Not to end my life a poor man
But by now, I know I should have run

Run, run my last race
Take my place
Have this number
Of mine

Run, run like a fire
Don't you run in
In the lanes
Run for time

Left school with a first class pass
Started work but as second class
School taught one and one is two
But right now, that answer just ain't true

My world is spinning around
Everything is lost that I found
People run, come ride with me
Let's find another place that's free

Ride, ride my see-saw
Take this place
On this trip
Just for me

Ride, take a free ride
Take my place
Have my seat
It's for free

176,Herb Alpert And The Tijuana Brass,Talk To The Animals,TRDXKGJ128F92F611A,1968,"If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it,
Chattin' with a chimp in chimpanzee,
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah,
What a neat achievement it would be!

If we could talk to the animals, learn their languages,
Maybe Take an animal degree,
I'd study elephant and eagle, buffalo and beagle,
Alligator, guinea pig, and flea!

I would converse in polar bear and python,
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo,
If people ask me ""can you speak rhinoceros?""
I'd say ""of courserous! Can't you?""

If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal,
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals,
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals,
And they could squeak and skwawk and speak and talk to us!

If I consult with the quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have,
Asking for the crocodiles for tea!
Or maybe lunch with three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be!

If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on earth could plainly see!
Discussing Eastern art and dramas
With intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward you'll agree!

I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
And my Pekinese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say ""whynotamous?"" and I would!

If I could parlay with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm
A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
And they could talk to *me*!

I'd study every *living* creature's language
So I could speak to all of them on site
If friends said ""can he talk in crab or pelican?""
You'd say ""*like hell he can"" and you'll be right!

And if you just stop to think of it
There's no doubt of it
I would win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt no word here squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!"

Vibrations tell me it's time to leave L.A.

Going back to Big Sur
Wish I could leave today
I want to walk beneath those Redwood trees
Just south of Monterey

A little cabin, quiet and alone
No television and no telephone
Water trickling down this little stream
Makes you wonder, is it all just a dream?

Going back to Big Sur
This time, I might just stay
Going back and straighten out my head
Just south of Monterey

Gentle people all around
Never try to put you down
Makes you feel like someone new
And they don't care who you are or what you do

I dig the ocean, kiss the setting sun
The stars dancing in the sky
Sort of puts you on a natural high

So my arms reach out to you for love

Mother died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

Grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a'hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road

But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road

I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road

Bring Dynamite and a crane
Blow you up, start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road

'Cause it's home
The only life I've ever known
Oh, I despise and disapprove you
But I love ya, 'cause it's home"

Whatever happens, do not blow your cool
You've gotta have nerves out of steel
Never let folks know how you honestly feel
I've lived my whole life this way
For example, take yesterday:
I breezed home happy, bringing her my pay
Her note read: ""So long Elmer, I have run away.""
I threw myself down across our empty bed
This is what I said:
Ooowww, oh nooooo‚Ä¶
But I was cool!

I went for a drink at a roadside bar
I got so stoned that I smashed up my car
The judge threw the book at me
And when I read the sentence there I said:
Oh no, man, you just can't do this to me‚Ä¶
But I was cool!

I said, she's the only one that I have to thank
So I found her and I took my gun and fired point-blank
The bullet whistled right on past that old woman's head
Killed my hound dog dead
Oooooh, oh no, not again‚Ä¶

As they took me away I was overheard to say:
Be cool, keep cool, stay cool, be cool, be‚Ä¶
No matter whatever happens to you man,
You must always remember to keep your mind at all times
And always stay cool!"

So they looked on medicinal compound
Now they call her Milly Bee

Jennifer Eccles, had terrible freckles
And the boys all called her names
But they gave her medicinal compound
Now he joins in all the games

We'll drink a drink, a drink 
To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink
The savior of our human race
For she invented, medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case

Lily the Pink, she turned to drink
She filled up with paraffin inside
And despite her medicinal compound
Sadly pickled Lily died

Up to heaven her soul ascended
All the church bells they did ring
She took with her medicinal compound
Hark the herald angels sing

We'll drink a drink, a drink 
To Lily the Pink, the Pink, the Pink
The saviour of our human race
For she invented, medicinal compound
Most efficacious in every case"

When she turned and said

'Til they turn and say

Cutting deep down in our affairs
Preachers of equality
They said believe it

Then even if I pass you, in the night
With one last breath of life
Could we still say the words to set us free
And let all men with evil hearts beware

Say a prayer once in a while
Pray for tomorrow or somebody's child
This gives the life that we possess
Worth everything and tenderness
So cast the rain with us into the sea
Tear down the walls of fear and pride
Let's build a world with love inside
Where all good men with peaceful hearts believe, believe

Fiery serpents
Spitting gold and cinnamon

And stars were shallow
And the sword that killed him
Was a sword of willow

I hear my mother calling and I must be on my way

Could not hold him
The fire could not burn him
Nor earth enfold him
Rise up Lazarus
Sweet and salty
Brother soldiers
Stop your gambling and talk to me
The thieves were stealers
But reason condemned him
And the grave was empty
Where they had laid him

Why heroes die at sunrise
Why the birds are arrows of the wise
Why each perfumed flower
Why each moment has its hour

It's you
It's all true

Stranger than that
Stranger than that

It's more than that, more than that

Now I know it's wrong, the things I ask you to do
But please believe me darling, I don't mean to hurt you
But could you just slip away without him knowing you're gone
Then we could meet somewhere, somewhere where we're both unknown

Can you just, can you slip away, slip away, slip away, yeah
I need you so

Oh, can you slip away, baby
I'd like to see you right now, darling
Can you slip away now, baby
'Cause I got to, I got to see you
I feel a deep burning inside"

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on the hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I have been unkind
I hope that you will just let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me: ""You must not ask for so much""
And the pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me: ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free"

Em que o corpo do homem apodrece
E sua alma cansada, penada, se afunda no ch√£o
E o bruxo do luxo baixado o capucho 
Chorando num nicho capacho do lixo
Caprichos n√£o mais voltar√£o

J√° houve um tempo 
Em que o tempo parou de passar
E um tal de homo sapiens 
N√£o soube disso aproveitar
Chorando, sorrindo, falando em calar
Pensando em pensar 

Quando o tempo parar de passar
Mas se entre l√°grimas voc√™ se achar 
E pensar que est√° a chorar
Este era o tempo em que o tempo √©!!"

All she wore was lace. 
She didn't know that I was poor, 
She never saw my place.
I was there to steal her money, 
Take her rings and run. 
Then I fell in love with the lady, 
Got away with none.

The lady's name was Susan Moore, 
Her daddy read the law. 
She didn't know that I was poor, 
And lived outside the law.

Her daddy said, I was a thief
And didn't marry her for love. 
I was Susan's true belief 
Married her for love.

I was there to steal her money, 
To take her rings and run. 
Then I fell in love with the lady
Got away with none.

The house she lived in had a wall
To keep the robbers out. 
She'd never stop to think at all
If that's what I'm about.

I was there to steal her money
Take her rings and run. 
Then I fell in love with the lady 
Got away with none."

Mind tousled I came to bear some thoughts from the past amid a dash of influenza.
And then I came to see in baggage the memories of truncated souvenirs.
The war years.
High moon I said high moon lighted high moon eye to my moon.

Far beyond the blue mist enveloped lawn the blanketed night comes on.
The champagne is dead and gone.
The forest around sensitive sound forest primeval.
Through the panes cloud buttermilk war remains and twisted cross war refrains lunatic so high moon I said high moon lighted high moon eye to my moon.

Your age will most probably carry away the letters enveloped in carrion.
Vague unpleasantries of the war.
May your son's progenitorship of the state haphazardly help him to carry on.
God send your son safe home to you.

Glory to the living God
Give glory to Him
Glory to the living God
Give glory to Him

Praise be His name

Praise be His name
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever, and ever"
270,Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera,Mother Writes,TRXTPJC12903CA219C,1968,"The postman's arrived and he's brought me a letter
A handwriting shaky it's merely a scrawl
But still I can find no penmanship better
It's from an old lady who's feeble and small
It tells me that our awful dog, always hardy
Has lately been hurt in some terrible fight
I know that to you this may not be worth saying
But to me any news from home is right
From home is right

One day I'll return home
Going back while Mother's still there
""Are you coming home this year?"" Mother writes

It tells of the birds that nest in the attic
Through the hole in the roof where the rain's coming from
The house where we live is no Kensington Palace
It hasn't been painted since Father's been gone
Father's been gone

One day I'll return home
Going back while Mother's still there
""Are you coming home this year?"" Mother writes
""The weather's been awful this year,"" Mother writes
""Are you coming home this year?"" Mother writes"
271,The Byrds,Life In Prison,TRIGHGX128F427EDBC,1968,"The jury found the verdict first degree 
They swore I planned her death to be 
I prayed they'd sentence me to die 
But they wanted me to live and I know why 

So I'd do life in prison for the wrongs I've done 
And I pray every night for death to come 
My life will be a burden every day 
If I could die, my pain might go away

With trembling hands I killed my darling wife 
Because I loved her more than life 
My love for her will last a long, long time
But I'd rather die than live to lose my mind 

And I'll do life in prison for the wrongs I've done
And I pray every night for death to come 
My life will be a burden every day 
If I could die, my pain might go away 
If I could die, my pain might go away"
272,Neil Diamond,Glory Road,TRZWCRX12903C9700E,1968,"Wearin' my high boots,
Got all my worldlies here in a sack
Looking for something,
Knowing that it ain't here where I'm at
Ain't looking back
I'm comin',
Ride by thumbin',
Get by bummin'
I'm on my way

Friend, have you seen glory road
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,
And I know glory road's waiting for me

Caught me a pick-up
Down from Seattle through to L.A.
Seems like those folks
Go chasin' a new star every day
Ain't gonna stay
In Nevada, through Wyomin',
Colorado I'm on my way

Friend, have you seen glory road
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,
And I know glory road's waiting for me

Met so many others
Wanted to know which way to go
Louisiana, New York City
They wanted the answer
They'd ask of me.
Friend, have you seen glory road?
Say, friend, I got a heavy load
And I know glory road's waiting for me
Rest my load,
Now I know glory road won't set me free"

Mind flowers

Take a trip
To the center
Of your mind
To your mind

Letting only
Your conscience
Be your guide

Finding out
That life is
Where its edge
Where its edge

Sacrifice!
Of your ego!
Sacrifice,
Sacrifice..

Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go!

Falling sounds explode
Across myriad conscience
Of tomorrow‚Äôs mind

You feel yourself
Rising slowly
And yet falling down
Upon shattered dreams

Crystal sights are
Shattered and distorted
By reality‚Äôs truth

Again..
You hear the crying
Of a thousand harpies
As tomorrow is gone

You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You are cleansed
You will never hear
Distortion again

I am falling
I am falling
I am falling
Into the quicksand
of my troubled mind
my troubled mind
my troubled mind
my troubled mind

Peace,
Tranquillity,

275,Blood_ Sweat & Tears,Meagan's Gypsy Eyes,TRHDHGG128F42668B2,1968,"Meagan's Gyspy eyes 
The lyres surround me 
purple drops of rain 
the sun shone around me 

Death that clouds her life 
will be forever 
[Thee?] Is loved 
yet cannot love, not never 

Mystic thoughts of love 
And her's completely 
taught her how to run 
though not discreetly 

Meagan's not as old 
As she'd like to think she's young 
sophisitcated dreams 
are as plastic as the songs 
she has sung 
likes to think she's hung up on herself 
and aren't you lucky? 

Meagan's Gypsy eyes 
The lyres surround me 
purple drops of rain 
The sun shone 'round me"
276,Tammy Wynette,It's My Way,TRPLDRH12903CF2634,1968,"I'll live every day for you and I'll breath ever breath for you
So if I'm mean and make you blue it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue and it breaks your heart in two
I can't help the things I do it's my way of loving you

Try to understad my love look into my heart
Don't you know I'd want to die if we ever part
All my life I'm gonna love you so there may be times it may not show
That my love for you is true it's my way of loving you
If I say that you're untrue...
It's my way of loving you"
277,Gordon Lightfoot,If I Could,TRVSEPB128F428710E,1968,"If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me 
If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold
Would I stand in the marketplace before
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall
And shot by the man in blue 

If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free
Would it mean anything to you 

If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time
I would turn his head away to the river
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free
For everyone to see 

If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me"
278,Townes Van Zandt,Tecumseh Valley,TRMXPTY12903CBE372,1968,"The name she gave was Caroline
The daughter of a miner
Well her ways were free
And it seemed to me
Sunshine walked beside her

She said she'd come to look for work
She was not seekin' favors
For a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor

But the times were hard, Lord, and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh valley
But she asked around
And a job she found
Tendin' bar for Gypsy Sally

She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her Pa had died
The word come down from Spencer

She turned to walkin' down the road
From all the hate inside her
And it was many a man
Returned again
To walk that road beside her

They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
In her hand when she died
Was a note that cried
Fare thee well 
Tecumseh valley"
