0,After The Fire,One Rule For You,TRYEEBF128F92DF711,1979,"What kind of line is that when you say you don't understand a single word
I tell you all these things, you turn around and make as if you never heard
What kind of line is that you're giving me

One rule for you, one rule for me 
Too many people try to tell me that I shouldn’t say the things I do
I know that you would only do the same if it meant as much too you
What kind of line is that you're giving me
One rule for you, one rule for me

They say believe in what you like as long as you can keep it to yourself
I say if what I know is right, it's wrong if I don't tell somebody else
What kind of line is that you're giving me
One rule for you, one rule for me"
1,Suzi Quatro,Love Hurts,TRQMXHY128F1468853,1979,"Love hurts
It's a crying shame
Love hurts
Such a funny thing
That you want me back again
Well it's too late now
You're finding out that love hurts

Well I don't know why
Why you said goodbye
And I don't know when
The fire left your eyes
You said you felt your need
Your need for me had died
And now I see your heart is breakin'
You're the one that's cryin'

Love hurts
It's a crying shame
Love hurts
Such a funny thing
That you want me back again
Well it's too late now
You're finding out that love hurts
You pushed me out the door
Right on outta your life
You said that you were sure
I'd never be your wife
You kicked me in my pride
But I came through the other side

It's sad to see your smile has gone
Your heart's the one that's dyin'

Love hurts - whoo - Love hurts - yeah - Love hurts -whoo
Love hurts - yeah - Love hurts - whoo - Love hurts - yeah - Love hurts - whoo
Well it's sad to see your heart is breakin'
You're the one that's cryin'"

4,The Only Ones,Trouble In The World,TRCUJDP128F42BBE78,1979,"Everybody thinks that they're the one
Everybody thinks they're stronger than everybody else
They see what happens to their friends
They don't believe that's how they're gonna end

If you do happen to be stronger
It only means you're gonna take longer to go under

That's the trouble in this world
The trouble in this world
The trouble is

At first you got the upper hand
When people warn you, you just don't understand
You say it's an old wives' tale
And everybody's gonna die anyway

This marriage was doomed from the start
She don't wanna have money she just rips out your heart
When you part, when you escape from
Her prison

Your saviour wrote you a message
You're superstitious, you know you shouldn't break the chain
Don't be scared to have children
Anyone would have thought it was pre-ordained

If you do happen to be stronger
It only means you're gonna take longer to go under

That's the trouble in this world
The trouble in this world
Oh, trouble in this world
Trouble, trouble
Trouble in the world
That's the trouble in this world"

We can dance to the hits that he plays
You, you just have to turn him on

Everybody listens to the radio
There you go
Everybody's singing to the songs they know
Radio
Everybody listens to the radio
Where you go
You don't have to miss your favorite show

I like funk
I'm in love with disco
I like punk
Things that you are into
Oh, I could hear it alll day long

Radio

With my friend driving on the high way
Listening to songs from then and today

You wrote, ""I love you,"" I wrote ""Me, too""
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh, it's in color, your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel and soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around

I've got your picture, I've got your picture 
I'd like a million of them all round my cell
I want the doctor to take your picture 
So I can look at you from inside as well 
You've got me turning up and turning down 
And turning in and turning 'round

Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women, no fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark 
Everyone around me is a total stranger 
Everyone avoids me like a psych lone-ranger
Everyone

That's why I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so

8,Bad Company,She Brings Me Love,TRYQVDN128F9327A15,1979,"Sometimes I get a feeling,
Deep in my soul
Sometimes I get a feeling,
I just can't control

Sometimes I get a feeling,
Deep in my heart
It's such a feeling that I know we'll never part

She brings me love, love, I know it's all that I need.

Sometimes I get a feeling,
deep in my bones
Sometimes I get a feeling,
won't leave me alone

Sometimes I get a feeling,
Deep in......side
It's such a feeling that my love I can't hide

She brings me love, love, I know it's all that I need.
She brings me love, love, I know it's all that I need."
9,Dave Edmunds,We Were Both Wrong (LP Version),TRUPVEA128F4236B81,1979,"Well, my baby and I
Are apart, I'll tell you why
Now we both had views in a fight,
Why couldn't we say to each other,
""The truth was, we were both wrong?""

Well, day after day and night after night,
We would have done one another.
Why haven't we admitted to each other,
We were both wrong.

Coming out one better, 
Meant more than a letter to each other,
Make a stand, don't back down,
Just stand your ground and you'll win.

I want you back, you can't beat 'em,
After all it's been so long.
I need your love so bad.
You're breaking my heart.
Why don't we say we were both wrong?

Coming out one better,
Meant more than one letter to each other,
Just make a stand, don't back down,
Just stand on your ground and you'll win.

I want you back, you can't beat 'em,
After all it's been so long.
I need your love so bad.
You're breaking my heart.

10,Steve Goodman,Men Who Love Women Who Love Men,TRLQLEY128F92F75AD,1979,"Went out on 42nd street
That's where the elite all retreat to greet
You can see them coming from everywhere
Every kind of man and woman you will find there

There are men who love women who love men
There are women who love women every now and then
There are men who love men because they can't pretend
They are men who love women who love men

There are those who make love for pay
And there are those who make love anyway
And over in the bar with a bottle of scotch
There are those who would rather just watch

All the men who love women who love men
And the women who love women every now and then
There are men who love men because they can't pretend
They are men who love women who love men

There are those who make love to machines
That don't talk back and are easy to clean
And there are those who will tell you out loud
That they can only make love in a crowd

A crowd of men who love women who love men
And women who love women every now and then
There are men who love men because they can't pretend
They are men who love women who love men

In the pursuit of true love's joy
Boys will be girls and girls will be boys
But sometimes it's hard to know what to do 
When you don't know who you're talking to

'cause there are men who love women who love men
There are women who love women every now and then
There are men who love men because they can't pretend
They are men who love women who love men"
11,The Only Ones,You've Got To Pay,TRYEHZA128F4267D10,1979,"I had to choose which one to lose
I couldn't do it for they each had their views
It was so hard, tearing apart
Now I know you gotta get it right at the start

I learned my lesson now
I learned it the hard way
If you wanna be in love
You've gotta pay and pay and pay

After the pain that was suffered in vain
The dark roads we travelled with nothing to gain
And though the pleasures will always be treasured
It's a shame it came to such drastic measures

Indecision, lack of conviction
Slurred diction failing what you're trying to say
If you are a slave to love
You're gonna pay and pay and pay

Our flightpath's a gradual descent from the firmament
I can tell by the tone of the letters you sent
What was once sacred is now filled with hatred
How come such love can be dissipated?

I've had enough of all this poison and decay
If you wanna come face to face with love
You've gotta pay and pay and pay"
12,Buddy Holly & The Crickets,Send Me Some Lovin',TRDSCJE128F932CA78,1979,"Send me some lovin' - send it I pray 
how can I love you - when you're far away 

Send me your picture - send it my dear 
so I can hold it - pretend you are near 

Can't you send me your kisses - I can feel their touch 
I need you so badly - I miss you so much 

My days are so lonely - my nights are so blue 
I'm here and I'm lonely - I'm waiting for you"

folhas a voar
e o inverno do meu tempo começa
a brotar, a minar

E os sonhos do passado
no passado estão presentes,
e o amor que não envelhece jamais
eu tenho paz
e ela tem paz

Nossas vidas
muito sofridas
caminhos tortuosos
entre flores e espinhos demais

Já não sinto saudade
saudades de nada que vi
o inverno do tempo da vida
oh! Deus
eu me sinto feliz

Surge a alvorada
folhas a voar..."

Just for you here's a love song
And it makes me glad to say
It's been a lovely day
And it's okay

I'll be the mail, you'll be the guard
I'll be the ink on your season ticket card
I'll be the rubbish, you'll be the bin
I'll be the paint on the sign if you'll be the tin

Ooooh, babe
Ooooh, babe
Ooooh, baby blue

On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear, flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice"
16,Manhattan Transfer,Wacky Dust (LP Version),TRTLBQD12903CE66FE,1979,"They call it wacky dust
It's from a hot cornet
It gives your feet a feeling so breezy
And oh, it's so easy to get

They call it wacky dust
It brings a dancing jag
And once it starts, then only a
Sap'll refuse to Big Apple or Shag

Oh I don't know just why 
It gets you so high
Putting a buzz in you heart
You'll do a marathon
You'll wanna go on 
Kickin' the ceilin' apart

They call it wacky dust
It's something you can't trust
And in the end the rhythm will stop
When it does, then you'll drop
From happy wacky dust

Oh we don't know just why 
It gets you so high
Putting a buzz in you heart
You'll do a marathon
You'll wanna go on 
Kickin' the ceilin' apart

When it does, then you'll drop
From happy wacky dust"

Hennes øyne er på alle.
Hun ar reisning, hun har stil,
Hun har sans for flørt og kalde -
¬kalde hender.
Så sving deg i dansen med damen i hvitt,
Og klem henne, si hun er pen,
Så blir hun så glad, la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la.

Hun er livredd for at frierne skal gå,
Mens hun holder dem på beite,
Men hun vil se hvem hun kan få,
Mens hun lever høyt på feite, feite tilbud.
Så sving deg i dansen med damen i hvitt,
Og kyss henne, si hun er skjønn,
Så blir hun så glad, la la la la la la la la la,
La la la la la la la.

Hun er barnet som vil eie deg en stund,
Hvis du kun beundrer henne,
Men hun vil surne uten grunn,
Og hun vil slå deg over ende
Neste uke.
Så sving deg i dansen med damen i hvitt,
Og takk henne, si hun er flink.
Takk henne, si hun er flink."
18,Tom Verlaine,Last Night (LP Version),TRJEELI128F14739C8,1979,"Last night a moon came out
She replaced my eyes
She said your plans undermined you
Until the shadow rings the bell
You'll only see behind you

She took her jewel
She left the kingdom
Though many say she was thrown out
Her tongue it's bitter
Her lips are sweet
There's so much she won't talk about

I went upon
This field of crosses
How I wish
I could change my vote
But there's no one there
There were no losses
Not when the fever broke

The whole wide world
Was your medallion
The stars like a necklace
So bright
I never looked
I never noticed I never saw
It was night"
19,Bee Gees,Tragedy (Album Version),TRDUAGH128F4243115,1979,"Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time, in a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin' home, I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why

With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere

When you lose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and your heart just dies
It's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on

As we go, as we go
The lucky ducks are waving us good bye
What a show, as we go

Don't forget your name, or the place from which you came
And the rest who still remain below

The best of us are taken by surprise
Even so, even so
We can't avoid the ultimate device
What a blow, even so

High and higher
How far do we go?
We can't expect to always see the sun shine
Frozen, silent, waiting in the cold
This is the longest night of all

The instruments are beating with a sigh
Yes we know, yes we know
It¹s time to close the door and say good night
Time to go, yes we know

All is cold tonight, but the stars are shining bright
And one day we¹ll see the light, I know

We can't expect to always see the sun shine

This is the longest night of all"

Oohoohooh oooh

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching, though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

""It's okay"", he smiles and says
Though this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head
But if you watch very close you'll see it all

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Have you heard about the lonesome loser?
Now, tell me, have you heard about the lonesome loser?"

I could stay here all evenin', listenin' to the music you play
Those same sweet songs of a golden yesterday

Hollerin', yes, yes, oh, what a thrill
Hollerin', yes, yes, oh, what a thrill
If you say I can stay, baby, you know I will

I will wake up in the morning and do the same sweet things
Rockin' with the record that the same sweet people sing
All the clouds from the west go east, you confess it is spring

Hollerin', yes, yes, oh, what a thrill
Hollerin', yes, yes, oh, what a thrill
I want you to want you to love you of your own free will

Baby, you're so beautiful to want me here to stay
I would be here forever, but I gotta die someday
But I will be lovin' you, baby, when I pass away

I will love you like a lover loves a lover always"

Everybody I have known
Has been and gone
With the music over
Here am i
A shadow echoing on
Spin me round...
Now there must be something
In what they say of all things
Great and small
There's dozen roses
Lying almost dying


To say all
Spin me round...
A nether world dancing toy
I'm wired for sound
Does it matter to me
Who turns the key? 
Now if life is for living
Then the way is clear
But I don't understand
Why the dream has ended
Yet I can't wake up
Lend a hand -
Spin a round..."

Brought myself along
Got a sense of conflict

So I built my place up high

Take me apart 'cause I'm out of control 
Send me a letter on a midnight scroll 

I got a lot on my head 
Most of it is you 
I got a lot on my head 
Can't forget about you 

Dance by the window in flamingo pink 
Go through the motions in your Romeo mink 
Condition's red, disposition's blue 
Why am I so attracted to you 

I got a lot on my head 
Most of it is you 
I got a lot on my head 
Can't forget about you 

Trip down the alleyway, take the back stairs 
I know it's good but good isn't fair 
That's what you said, flashbulb in your eye 
How can I hold you when you're waving goodbye

I got a lot on my head

Can't forget about you"

Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

Hold me like you'll never let me go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around 
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
The close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days, the days to come
When I won't have to leave you alone
About that time I won't have to say

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Ah, hold me like you'll never let me go

Stick it right back in the stack jack

Gaberdine Angus had a mean trick
Had a mean wang - made women sick

Gaberdine Angus - open your coat

Why waste words - risk resistance
When you can climax from a distance
Shock tactics - designed to stun
Gaberdine Angus - it isn't done

Your pink extremity has gone unseen
She doesn't give the usual nervous cough
So zip up Angus - then zip off."

But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?

Hello-hurray, what a nice day
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, I hope rain stops play
For the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles

Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the House of Commons in your brand new shoes
Composed a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing

Hello-hurray, cheers then, mate
It's the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles
Hello-hurray, an extremist scrape
With the Eton Rifles, Eton Rifles

Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a guilty schoolboy

What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns, then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing like a naughty schoolboy

We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody, and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit

37,Marianne Faithfull,The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan,TRIJTPP128F42375E5,1979,"The morning sun touched lightly on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In a white suburban bedroom in a white suburban town
As she lay there 'neath the covers dreaming of a thousand lovers
'Til the world turned to orange and the room went spinning round

At the age of thirty-seven she realised she'd never
Ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing and she sat there softly singing
Little nursery rhymes she'd memorised in her daddy's easy chair

Her husband, he was off to work and the kids were off to school
And there were, oh, so many ways for her to spend the day
She could clean the house for hours or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked through the shady street screaming all the way

At the age of thirty-seven she realised she'd never
Ride through Paris in a sports car with the warm wind in her hair
So she let the phone keep ringing as she sat there softly singing
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorised in her daddy's easy chair

The evening sun touched gently on the eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the roof top where she climbed when all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsied to the man who reached and offered her his hand,
And he led her down to the long white car that waited past the crowd

At the age of thirty-seven she knew she'd found forever
As she rode along through Paris with the warm wind in her hair"

And don't you know I think of you?

It keeps on cutting through
There's nowhere I can run to,
Can't seem to lose the thought of you
I never really was a bad girl,
But you got me in trouble again.

Well, I used to walk a straight line,
I knew what I was doing all the time.
There was nothing that could move me,
I always held my ground.
But you got me where you want me,
And now you're always here to haunt me.
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

I still remember how it felt
When you put your arms around me
But if I thought that you would love me
I was blind

But you got me where you want me
And now you're always here to haunt me
I never really was a bad girl
But you got me in trouble again

Well, you think I would have learned by now,
And I'd keep away from you, somehow
Just like a little child,
I keep coming back for more.
But baby, when you called today,
Don't you know that I'll come out and play
I never really was a bad girl,
But you got me in trouble again."

On avait chacun sa guitare
On n'était pas loin d'une gare

Et tu m'as dis quand leurs ailes sont mortes
Les papillons vont où le vent les porte
On a pris le premier chemin venu

Et quand la nuit est tombée
Sur la voie ferrée
On était bien loin de la ville
On n'entendait que des notes
Et le bruit de nos bottes
Sous la pleine lune immobile

On a traversé les semaines
Comme de vrais fêtes foraines
Sans même penser au retour
On s'est perdu dans les nuages
Comme les oiseaux de passages
A suivre les fils d'un jour

Et pour ne pas que des fous nous renversent,
On prenait les chemins de traverse
Même s'ils ne sont jamais les plus courts

Et quand la nuit tombait
Sur la voie ferrée
On était bien loin de la ville
On n'entendait que des notes
Et le bruit de nos bottes
Sous la pleine lune immobile

Et quelques fois je me souviens
Ceux qui nous ont lâché les chiens
Et jeté des pierres au visage
Ils n'ont rien empêché quand même
Puisque le seul métier qu'on aime
C'est la bohème et le voyage

Et quand la nuit va tomber
Sur la voie ferrée
On sera bien loin de la ville
On n'entendra que des notes
Et le bruit de nos bottes

So far it seems
Too bad the blues
Blew my schemes
Dynamite
Such sweet surprise
In southern heat
Or northern skies
Ain't that so
Shadows cling
Where shutters close
Who can tell
Heaven knows
Why some can laugh
And some can sing
Stand in line
Or get on down and swing
Ain't that so
Cross the street
Who's ringing bells?
Peeling walls
Of cheap hotels
Neon flare
A sudden chill
And there you lie
And time stands still
Ain't that so"
46,Gillan,Puget Sound ,TRLNQOE128F92D16AB,1979,"I remember the bus just the greyhound and us
It was in between St. Paul and Fargo
There were two days to go but we virgins were slow
And my hand hadn't moved since Chicago

Moving over your knee was new territory
We were passing through Billings Montana
As we slipped through Spokane you said something profane
And I shifted up into Nirvana

I can feel you I can see
Puget sound you belong to me
I can feel you mighty sea
Puget sound you belong to me

Lying there like a pearl oh my Ithica girl
We've got 44 days in Tacoma
And we lay in the sand with my life in your hand
I just drifted in Pacificoma

I can feel you gentle sea
Puget sound you have set me free
Feel the ocean feel the sun
Puget sound feel your waters runs

There was nothing to say we just shivered all day
And we touched and I kissed you all over
They said go west young man and it's true that you can
For an old 99 dollar rover"

People pass me by, looking for what I've found,
But to see what I see you got to know who I know,
And to be where I am you got to follow.

The roaring of the sea, the pounding of the wave,
The water calling me; my old life to the grave.

And I went under as it came over,
The holy water spoke to me,
And I went under as it came over,
The holy water spoke to me.

You light up the sky,
You're the power of the sun,
You're the starlight in the darkness,
On your laughter, shadows run,
You're a mighty wind of glory and the Father all in one,
You're the morning star,
You're the midnight son.

The sun burned through the shadows,
And Mary saw the light in the eyes of the risen saviour, as the day shut out the night,
But to see what I see you got to know who I know,
And to be where I am you got to learn to follow,
But to know who I know you got to learn to follow,
Learn to follow."

A weh dent a go sek

Cos

My people are in a mess
But nobody wants to know
Cos when you're down and out and oppressed
You've got to fight your battles from the
Lowest of the low
So keep your distance and take your stance,
Cos this could be your utmost chance.

You've had all night and day to
Consider and pray
You've brought fire on my head and
Now you must pay.

CHORUS

Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
where my people suffer...

Take Rastaman culture for instance,
Dem think is political joke,
But we people know better then that,
Cos what keeps us together is
Jah Herb that we smoke

I and I know the truth of it all,
Cos we have smashed our heads
'gainst that wall,
And now I seh we must create a scene,
We must recapture our culture
by any means.

CHORUS
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
Babylon makes the rules
where my people suffer ...

Count the times we've been let down,
And left us in despair,
And woe betide that evil man,
Who giveth not a care.
You've gotta check yourself just
One more time,
Reassure your mind -
Cos those who are chosen
by the father's hand
Must not get left behind.

Rasta seh - guidance
(4) But Backrah seh different still

Babylon makes the rules but
Jah love will carry I home."

Seeing things not there
Television flickers 
On channel One
And static cracks the air

Come sunshine
Come next time
Come...
Oh! Come along with me!
I will show you life
I will give you my eyes
I will give you security...

A nightmare of my past

57,Joan Baez,For Sasha,TRWGSLC128F92FA2AE,1979,"Here by my window in Germany
A morning bird flies close to me
On his wing I see a yellow star
The lights are on in the factory
The frost is hung on the linden tree
And I remember where we are

And I remember the holocaust
I remember all we lost
The families torn and the borders crossed
And I sing of it now for Sasha

A young German officer lies in his bed
Bandages from toe to head
A prisoner of the camps draws nigh
If you are Abel and I am Cain
Forgive me from my bed of pain
I know not why we die

It was I who ordered the building burned
The job was over and as I turned
A father and his son
Caught in the flames high above the ground
From cradled arms the boy looked down
One leap and their lives were done

And I remember the holocaust
I remember all we lost
The children gone and the borders crossed
And I sing of it now for Sasha

You in frozen streets of Heidelberg
Your youth unbearded takes form in words
And the ghosts of the past are kind
For this was your university
The years were long but the spirits free
And your river runs to the Rhine

The smoke filled taverns that you once roamed
With the discontented who'd stayed at home
You must have whiskey or you'll die
The beer garden under the old chateau
Our faces now in the candle glow
See the memories how they shine

But you remember the holocaust
You remember all we lost
The families torn and the borders crossed
And we'll sing of it now for Sasha"

A war dance, a war dance
A war dance, a war dance

Look at graffiti scrawled on the wall
You know the reason outside the door
You got something nasty in your mind
Trying to get out. Do a war dance

A war dance, a war dance
A war dance, a war dance

You've opened the pit. Honesty is sick
You try to be honest look what you get
The food runs short and then the money talks
One way out, your premonition is correct

All I see is an old man's alibi
There's a world outside
but I'm unaware
I open my books but the pages stare
It's a double edge

Communist eyes-all so blind
I can't even play the game now

I'm living through Communist times
I wave my flag and hold me head high
I can feel the glory of my
comrades in masses
But I'm waiting for the day
when this madness passes
It's a double edge..."
70,Steve Hackett,The Ballad Of The Decomposing Man (Alternate Mix) (2005 Digital Remaster),TRNNQAR128F1455AB8,1979,"In a very large factory I belong
And I work the night shift all year long
Old Freddy on a chainsaw lost his feet
Thinking 'bout a blonde he'll never meet
Tried to take his life again the other week
Keep your chin up, haven't a care 'ave you?
Just join the party, allegiance I swear

Eee what's the matter with Arthur Royal?
I'll go and top up his batteries and check the oil
Young Arthur blew a fuse two days ago,
Set himself alight, you didn't know
Nearly burnt us down the twit just had to go
Take your chances, live on hot air (wouldn't you?)
Chance of promotion, I'll take that chair

Dreaming of golden sands and palm trees
I said file these quickly and then staple these
Get yourself altered undo the seam, and get back just
In time for tea (and don't be late, mind)

Nobody's perfect least of all me
Married the job at age 23
Just keep my nose clean egg chips and beans
I'm always full of steam

...I could never afford to go to Butlins...
...But I did manage to go to Majorca once...
...Wish I hadn't bothered...
...Past the entrance, by I bored myself...
...Who are all these people in my office, anyway?...
...Who are they? Where do they come from, do y'know them?..."

I only look this way at you

Before I take you on a date
I get the heebie-jeebies
And my panic makes me late
I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before I chicken out
And decide you're not at home

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

I never noticed the size of my feet
Till I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape I'm in
For the shape I'm in

Does everyone stare the way I do?
I only stare this way at you

I want to write you a sonnet
But I don't know where to start
I'm so used to laughing
At the things in my heart
Last of all I'm sorry
'Cause you never asked for this

If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life

U say u'll call me and then u don't
I'll want 2 kiss u and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

This morning I wanted a cup of coffee
But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration
But I didn't have any dreams
Couple with the fact that u belong 2 another
Whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
with the undertaker which one will it be?
U can cry 4ever but u'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4ever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never

Give back the chains - if u don't u will die
Nothing must come between u and I

I've got 3 chains o' gold
And they will shine 4ever
If one of us has 2 go
U will go before me

If one of us has 2 go (3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me
(3 chains o' gold)
U will go before me, baby (they will shine 4ever)
Cuz I sho'nuff say u will

Vi tänkte väl förlova oss, men min pappa sa tyvärr.
Håll fingrarna ifrån den damen min son och sky henne som pest.
För du och hon har samma far och då blir det incest.

Sen träffade jag Linnea och vi prasslade en tid.
Sen kunde det inte hjälpas att Linnea blev gravid.
När hennes mor fick se min far så stämde hon upp ett tjut.
Linnea var min syster och sen fick vi göra slut.

Anita och Carina, Britt-Louise och Siv.
Ja, hundra andra damer fick jag stryka ur mitt liv.
För pappa kände deras mor och sade till direkt.
Den kan du inte gifta dig med för ni är faktiskt släkt.

Förstår du nu medborgare att jag blev ganska sne.
Varenda dam i våran by var jag besläktad med.
Mitt sexualliv krånglade till aska blev min glöd.
Så jag gick till min mamma jag och klagade min nöd.

Då sa mamma så här:
Min käre son sa mamma då uti all enkelhet.
Din pappa är en jävla bock som alla människor vet.
Och alla dessa damer är han säkert upphov till.
Men han är inte far till dig så gift dig med vem du vill."

If you caan, Follow slowly.
Thus enter as we may, by a hole, in the floor.
Deep darker than the black, seemed to hear,
Many a rat.
Tried harder as I fought, Thought my life,
Finally brought.
Knees trembling in my legs,
Wish to get out, out and about
Out and about.
Here, now, fear, let me free
Now, here, now.
Don't leave me fast here, oh please
You won't let me live again!!
This way.
come, don't be so afraid, by the fire, sit beside
Change all your whims and cares
To the tide of the night

Did the ghost, disappear
Fire deep my heart my soul, chase him off,
Very clear, very clearly."

You were standing there,
There was music in the air.

When you feel the fire is burnin'.
Everybody was there, everybody to share,

There you were on your own, 
Lookin' like you were the only one around.
I had to be with you,
Nothin' else that I could do.

But hours must really have rushed by.

But love was in your eyes.

But love went on and on...

the world is changing day to day,
it moves so fast and leaves them in another time;
an old-fashioned dancer is dancing alone,
dreaming of those music halls,
and with his lady waltzing away until the dawn,
and i thought i heard him say,
please don't take my dreams away;

they carry me back again, show me that life again,
carry me back to the places that i knew,
carry me back again, show me that life again,
carry me back to the places that i knew...

old-fashioned lovers, they walk in the park,
beside the river hand in hand,
and hurry home for tea before it gets dark,
could be you and me one day,
time will come when we will say,

carry me back again, show me that life again,
carry me back to the places that i knew,
carry me back again, show me that life again,
carry me back to the places that i knew;
carry me back again, show me that life again,
carry me back to the places that i knew..."
82,Joan Baez,Before The Deluge,TRODOPK128F92FA232,1979,"Some of them were dreamers
And some of them were fools
Who were making plans and thinking of the future
With the energy of the innocent
They were gathering the tools
They would need to make their journey back to nature
While the sand slipped through the opening
And their hands reached for the golden ring
With their hearts they turned to each other's heart for refuge
In the troubled years that came before the deluge

Some of them knew pleasure
And some of them knew pain
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
They went flying around in the rain
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered
And in the end they traded their tired wings
For the resignation that living brings
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
For the glitter and the rouge
And in the moment they were swept before the deluge

Now let the music keep our spirits high
And let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by
By and by...
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky

Some of them were angry
At the way the earth was abused
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

Now let the music keep our spirits high
And let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by
By and by...
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky"

Won't you come into this land of love?
Won't you come into this love with me?
Won't you come into this love of mine?

And take us down to, oh, Paradise Drive
Hurry, won't you hurry 'cause I just can't wait

Just take me by the hand and I'll show you the way

Mais cheia de graça
É ela menina
Que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço
A caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado
Do sol de lpanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, por que estou tão sozinha?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo
Por causa do amor"
91,Pierangelo Bertoli,A Muso Duro,TRDHVNP128F42A3DF2,1979,"E adesso che farò, non so che dire
E ho freddo come quando stavo solo
Ho sempre scritto i versi con la penna
Non ordini precisi di lavoro.
Ho sempre odiato i porci ed i ruffiani
E quelli che rubavano un salario
I falsi che si fanno una carriera
Con certe prestazioni fuori orario
Canterò le mie canzoni per la strada
Ed affronterò la vita a muso duro
Un guerriero senza patria e senza spada
Con un piede nel passato
E lo sguardo dritto e aperto nel futuro.
Ho speso quattro secoli di vita
E ho fatto mille viaggi nei deserti
Perché volevo dire ciò che penso
Volevo andare avanti ad occhi aperti
Adesso dovrei fare le canzoni
Con i dosaggi esatti degli esperti
Magari poi vestirmi come un fesso
Per fare il deficiente nei concerti.
Canterò le mie canzoni per la strada
Ed affronterò la vita a muso duro
Un guerriero senza patria e senza spada
Con un piede nel passato
E lo sguardo dritto e aperto nel futuro.
Non so se sono stato mai poeta
E non mi importa niente di saperlo
Riempirò i bicchieri del mio vino
Non so com'è però vi invito a berlo
E le masturbazioni celebrali
Le lascio a chi è maturo al punto giusto
Le mie canzoni voglio raccontarle
A chi sa masturbarsi per il gusto.
Canterò le mie canzoni per la strada
Ed affronterò la vita a muso duro
Un guerriero senza patria e senza spada
Con un piede nel passato
E lo sguardo dritto e aperto nel futuro.
E non so se avrò gli amici a farmi il coro
O se avrò soltanto volti sconosciuti
Canterò le mie canzoni a tutti loro
E alla fine della strada
Potrò dire che i miei giorni li ho vissuti."

Too bad to be true
All of my tomorrow's
Are lousy coz of you
You put the Shat in Shatter
Put the Pain in Spain
Your germs are splattered about
Your face is just a stain

You're certainly no raver, commonly known as a drag
Do us all a favour, here... wear this polythene bag

You're like a dose of scabies
I've got you under my skin
You make life a fairy tale... Grimm!

People mention murder, the moment you arrive
I'd consider killing you if I thought you were alive
You've got this slippery quality
It makes me think of phlegm
And a dual personality
I hate both of them

Your bad breath, vamps disease, destruction, and decay
Please, please, please, please, take yourself away
Like a death a birthday party
You ruin all the fun
Like a sucked and spat our smartie
You're no use to anyone
Like the shadow of the guillotine
On a dead consumptive's face
Speaking as an outsider
What do you think of the human race

You went to a progressive psychiatrist
He recommended suicide...
Before scratching your bad name off his list
And pointing the way outside

You hear laughter breaking through, it makes you want to fart
You're heading for a breakdown
Better pull yourself apart

Your dirty name gets passed about when something goes amiss
Your attitudes are platitudes
Just make me wanna piss

What kind of creature bore you
Was is some kind of bat
They can't find a good word for you
But I can...

So I wrote it in the words of this song

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

The glamour of the gay night life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flows
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life"

I've lived a life that's full and each and every highway
And that, much more than this I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did, what I have to do
I saw it through with out condemption

I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times, I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck fuck all else to do
But through it all, when there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out I faced the wall and the world
And did it my way

I've laughed and been a snake
I've had my fill, my share of living
And now, the tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat and may I say, not in a gay way
Oh no, no not me I did it my way

For what is a brat, what has he got
When he wears hats and he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words, of one who kneels
The record shows, I've took my blows
And did it my way"

111,Kansas,Stay Out Of Trouble,TRAKCAP128F426415E,1979,"Step outside and feel the tingle
Trouble finds you every night
You wonder where nobody knows you
Your civil tone is not polite
You got no friends, you don't like people
You tried it once and they let you down
And after seven years you're still hurt and angry
And inside your head is an awful sound

Some say that trouble is my middle name
I find it very easy and I sin out just the same
So stay out of trouble, don't cry
Stay out of trouble, you'll die

You're on the street the clock strikes 11
And it takes that seven years away
Now you're walking with that lovely lady
And just like that you can hear her say
""Well I know for sure you ain't got the money
for an ounce of coke or a Cadillac!""
I said, ""It ain't no use in trying to fool me
A big woman like you has got to fight back""

Some say that trouble is my middle name
I find it very easy and I sin out just the same
So stay out of trouble, don't cry
Stay out of trouble, you'll die

Inside your head it sounds like thunder
And your room becomes an ugly shell
You get in your car and you start the engine
And you drive with your right foot in hell
Well, someone said, ""ain't that funny
Well, I saw that boy just the other night""
Went into this bar and really got rowdy
With his friends and him is an awful fight

Some say that trouble is my middle name
I find it very easy and I sin out just the same
So stay out of trouble, don't cry
Stay out of trouble, you'll die"

So lets be married one more night

It's light, light enough
To let it go
It's light enough to let it go

Remember when the scenery started fading
I held you til you learned to walk on air
So don't look down the ground is gone,
there's no one waiting anyway
The Smoky Life is practiced
Everywhere

So set your restless heart at ease
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves
They waste no time waiting for the snow
Don't argue now you'll be late
There is nothing to investigate
It's light enough, light enough

To let it go
Light enough to let it go

Remember when the scenery started fading
I held you til you learned to walk on air
So don't look down the ground is gone,
There's no one waiting anyway

You can look up all my very closest friends

All I made was one mistake

I heard that you were lonely 
One careful look shows you're lonely 

All night you'll fight 
With your mind, with your mind 

After lights out, don't make a sound 
Apple blossoms, come fallin' down 
Black and white sun shining brightly 
Shelter your eyes, hold on tightly 

All night you'll fight 
With your mind, with your mind 

Love thy neighbor 
You will understand 
Coffee flavor, yours or any brand 
I heard that you were lonely 
Nothing is real when you're lonely 

All night you'll fight 
With your mind, with your mind"
132,Gal Costa,Olha,TRZXGIT128F92FE43F,1979,"Olha, você tem todas as coisas
Que um dia eu sonhei pra mim
A cabeça cheia de problemas
Não me importo, eu gosto mesmo assim
Tem os olhos cheios de esperança
De uma cor que mais ninguém possui
Me traz meu passado e as lembranças
Do que eu sempre quis ser e não fui
Olha, você vive tão distante
Muito além do que eu posso ter
E eu que sempre fui tão inconstante
Te juro, meu amor, agora é pra valer
Olha, vem comigo aonde eu for
Seja minha amante e meu amor
Vem seguir comigo o meu caminho 
E viver a vida só de amor"
133,Buddy Holly,Fool's Paradise,TRRQLNM128F93500CD,1979,"You took me up to heaven, when you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses, blinded by your charms
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

When you told me that you loved me, I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be any truth in love so new
I was lost in a fool's paradise
Good and lost in a fool's paradise

The whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance 
And my love came tumbling down

Well you treat me kinda coolish and may never let me know
That you think I'm being fooling because I love you so
I'll still get lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise

Well you treat me kinda coolish and may never let me know
That you think I'm being fooling because I love you so
I'll still get lost in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise
Lost with you in a fool's paradise"
134,The Police,Bring On The Night,TRMIMZV128E0793AC5,1979,"The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow, it's just another day
As I bid yesterday good-bye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head there in the dark
Can't see for the brightness staring me blind
As I bid this yesterday good-bye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

I couldn't stand another hour of daylight..."
135,The Babys,Turn Around In Tokyo,TRPIFSA12903CA248F,1979,"Leavin' on the runway
To another world
Still stranded somewhere
In between the earth and sky
It's 3 AM
I'm in Japan
You're still on my mind
Your long-distance love is coming through alright 
And I'm not lonely
Lost in the Orient
I'm dreamin' of
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta send it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo 
Well I feel like a stranger 
In a modern land
Outside the sky light stands like a Buddha shrine
And on the east horizon there's complete design
It's the quiet hours of darkness before the light 
The words don't come easy
Lost in the Orient
I miss you
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta make it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
I'm comin' home now

136,Kansas,Away From You,TRKQATM128F4264159,1979,"Used to think about what I would grow up to be
Good or bad, right or wrong, it was no harm to me
Was a time in my life when I wish I'd have known
You can't gamble with fate, you might end up alone

Meet me where the feeling is high, let the sound surround you
Meet me at the top of the sky, where the colors fly around you
Well, I'm lost in a world of dismay
But nothin' can take me away from you

Left you back while I worked very hard to succeed
All the distance I've gone makes it hard to believe
You and I were so close, now we're so far apart
And I remember the feeling we shared in our heart

Meet me where the feeling is high, let the sound surround you
Meet me at the top of the sky, where the colors fly around you
Well, I'm lost in a world of dismay
But nothin' can take me away from you

Again and again you return to haunt me in my dreams
See your eyes, how they glisten, your hair how it gleams
And I know I will miss you when you have to go
I return to my place until nights lets me know

Meet me where the feeling is high, let the sound surround you
Meet me at the top of the sky, where the colors fly around you
Well, I'm lost in a world of dismay
But nothin' can take me away from you"

And maybe I'll see you next time, that I'm around
Until then I hope your happy baby and good times come your way
I'm back on the road again, I'm on my way 

Well I've loved you since the day I met you and I'll love you till the day I die
But we both know the life I'm livin’ and we both know the reason why

Who could keep your heart warm when ice has turned it blue
But with the beggin' sleeping losers as they turn in for the night
I'm looking back for home and I can see the lights

I should be jumpin' shoutin' that I made it all this way
From Camden town station to 44th and 8th
Not many make it this far and many say we're great
But just like them we walk on an' we can't escape our fate
Can't you hear the sighing
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue
Both say they needed something new

So I'm standing at the gates of the west
I burn money at the lights of the sign
The city casts a shadow of the perfect crime
I'm standing at the gates of the east
I take my pulse and the pulse of my friend
The city casts a shadow, will I see you again?

The immigrants an' remnants of all the glory years
Are clustered around the bar again for another round of beers
Little Richard's in the kitchen playing spoons and plates
He's telling the waitress he's great

Ah say I know somewhere back'n'forth in time
Out on the dustbowls, deep in the roulette mine
Or in a ghetto cellar only yesterday
There's a move into the future for the USA.

I hear them crying
Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue
Both said they needed something new

Standing at the gates of the west
In the shadow again
I'm standing at the gates of the west
In the shadow again"

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't but I love you

I don't want to tie you down
Don't need a reason to have you around
But each time you walk away
Don't be suprised if I ask you to stay
Can't sleep alone at night
I just can't seem to get it right
Damned if I do
And I'm damned if I don't but I love you
I said I'm damned if I do
And I'm damned if I don't cause I love you

I ain't got a heart of stone
You haven't left me a mind of my own
But it's got such a hold on me
I don't think I could ever be free
How can I survive
I'm fighting to keep myself alive
I'm damned if I do
Damned if I don't but I love you

All with a hard luck story and a sad sad tale

I need to be by myself
I need to be by your side
I need...
Sometimes
I need the company of art
I need the company of friends
I need you

And my heart is stronger
Than a four-letter-long word

Searching the eyes of so many lonely people
Whose cowardice proved much too strong for vice

Don't say you ""love"" me -oh no
Don't ask that from me -no no no

That alphabet you call ""love""
That alphabet you call ""love""
That alphabet you call ""love""
That alphabet you call ""love""

Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do

Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love

Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone, yeah
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on

144,The Sugarhill Gang,Rapper's Delight,TRMBLKP12903CAC45C,1979,"I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow

But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well, so far youve heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y
Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:
Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T
Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac

So after school, I take a dip in the pool which is really on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again

Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend

Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well, it's on n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee

Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be

Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat

And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sure shot MCs for the affair

Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize

Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop
Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got

I guess by now, you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind

Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind

I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?

I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast

Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody and dance to the beat

I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you dont stop
Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat

I said I can't wait till the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak

And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called The Freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak

I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies

And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint

A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist
Everybody, I say, it goes like this:

Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables

This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you!
The Cassanova legend must have been true!""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane

And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose

He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest

He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""

I gon' do it, I gon' do it
I gon' do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere

Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop!

Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before

And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons

She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece""

And now, people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew

Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party, ya got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove

For you to dance, you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair

But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:
That to have a party, ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn

And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream
And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time

It was phase two, just a-doin' a do
Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive, girls, get on your feet

To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn

Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet

Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood

Like goin' up and not comin' down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do The Freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood

So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""

So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate

While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese

Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""

So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate

And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""

With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat

I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele

And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad

He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die

A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""

So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile

I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality

Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night

A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends

A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most

It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet

A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight

Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously

I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee

At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live

At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?

I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak

At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme

Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on
I say you don't stop, gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
'Cause I'm a helluva man when i'm on the miC
I am the definite feast delight
Come to the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously"

I was just coasting when I met you

Bragging and boasting
And baby won't you please tell me
Just what I have to do to stand just half a chance
To change my luck with you

Oh, how did I let that happen?

And watch them all twist pretzels by hand, by hand
And if only we all lived in Pretzel Land

Six days a week, when he wakes up
She will fill his coffee cup
Six days a week he is a working man
He wheels his wagon to the park
He sells pretzels 'till it's dark
But that's the only life that he understands
He's his own man

He's the little pretzel man, he's got his twisted pretzel hands
He's got that pretzel wife, that he's loved all his pretzel life
And he's got himself a pretzel girl, that they both brought into their world

And if only we all lived in Pretzel Land

On Sunday, when they go to church
In the seventh pew they perch
They listen to his sermon and they believe
They're grateful for the food they ate
So they put their money in a plate
They've heard of hungry children and they grieve (they believe)

So we watch them all twist pretzels by hand, by hand
And if only we all lived in Pretzel Land

We watch him sink

I can't stand the dark anymore

The shot a wide angle now 
A man is banging on the door 
Of a chrome elevator
Lights go out no air inside 
Get no lift from this lost ride 
On a cracked generator

Let me out...
Let me out...
Let me out...
I can't stand the dark anymore

The lift goes down 
Night creeps in 
The screws go round 
Blood runs cold

Theme tune in, the credits roll
The story told

One by one we left home.
We went so far out there.
Everybody got scared.
My uncle did it; my daddy did it.
I'm beginning to think that it runs in the family
Oh no, runs in the family.

All the boys could have gone to school.
All the girls were pretty enough to play the fool
Something about the danger zone
Wouldn't leave the bunch of us alone.

I remember that night.
It was the one I picked a fight with you.
I'm holding the bag
Just like my mama did;
Just like her mama did.

I'll hold on though the whole world tells me I'm wrong
Someday, someday
But it seems so long

Ask me to prove my love and I will do anything
So if they turn off the light of the sun why should I care
I'll hold on thought the whole world tells me I'm wrong
Then in the morning as you leave me
You touch my hand to show how much you care
But just when I need you
You won't be there

Oh I'll hold on but I need a shoulder to lean on

Why must our love be something in the air

We were so close and nothing came between us and the world
No personal situations

And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together

We stole from the schools and their libraries
We stole from the drugs that sent us to sleep
We stole from the drink that made us sick
We stole anything that we couldn't keep
And it was enough, we didn't have to spoil anything
And always be as thick as thieves

Like a perfect stranger, you came into my life
Then like the perfect lone ranger
You rode away, rode away, rode away, rode away

We stole the love from young girls in ivory towers
We stole autumn leaves and summer showers
We stole the silent wind that says you are free
We stole everything that we could see
But it wasn't enough - and now we've gone and spoiled everything
Now we're no longer as thick as thieves

You came into my life 
Then like a perfect stranger
You walked away, walked away, walked away, walked away

Thick as thieves us, we'd stick together for all time
And we meant it but it turns out just for a while
We stole the friendship that bound us together

We stole the burning sun in the open sky
We stole the twinkling stars in the black night
We stole the green belt fields that made us believe
We stole everything that we could see

But something came along that changed our minds
I don't know what and I don't know why
But we seemed to grow up in a flash of time
While we watched our ideals helplessly unwind

No, we're no longer as thick as thieves - no
We're not as thick as we used to be, no

We're not as thick as we used to be

Once or twice you've shown the face I like
And it's affected me more than I'd want it to

It's so very wrong to hold a love so strong
And never have the chance to share it

Bye bye now my sweet love

Bye bye those tears I cry
I need you only to say goodbye

And then she talks to me and I can't think of nothing else, oh yeah.

You know I think I'm in another world, oh yeah.

Laughter runs across her face again
And tears, they seem to vanish in her arm embrace, oh yeah
And she whis-whis-whispers something in my ear, oh yeah.

But the valley was infected, by a different kind of beauty
And the Indians they knew, it was a devil's sanctuary.

Out of this unholy dawn, a car came stirring up the sand
And a woman from a passion play
Held up the limousine that brought me
All this way today.  And I didn't need to turn around
So strong was the message, and the man who planned her life
Commanded all that followed: Well they bellowed, and they hollered
And they threw each other down, down in this valley
This cruel and lovely valley, Oh it should have been an alley
In some low down part of town

As the lights came up, there was no sun
And brandy splattered all over the ground
As this woman with her head held high
Yelled love and why oh why, you're killing me oh follow me-
As I watched safe and clean, from the frosted windows of that limousine

Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down


Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley
Oh it sould have been an alley, in some low down part of town

Before he'd been so funny, imagining the best:
That he'd escaper recrimination, for abandoning the nest
He'd been joking and stoned, while he was entertaining me
But then turned and was stunned, by her panic and her misery

And I was in the get-away car
Giving him a chance, to get away
Get away, get away

And how the valley smoked, as he crossed Route 25
With his cymbals and his shattered crown, leaving all alone
His eyes fixed on the ground.  And he didn't even turn around
So strong was the message, and he fell into the shallow sky
And was swallowed.
Well they bellowed and they hollered, and they threw each other down
Down in this valley, this cruel and lovely valley
Well it should have been an alley, In some low down part of town"

192,Stan Rogers,Rolling Down to Old Maui,TRBWRLR128F4271E0D,1979,"It's a damn tough life, full of toil and strife, we whalermen undergo
And we don't give a damn when the gale is done how hard the
winds did blow
'Cause we're homeward bound from the Arctic ground with a good ship
taut and free
And we won't give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls
from old Maui

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys, rolling down to old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui

Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and
wind and rain
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon
shall see again
Six hellish months we've passed away on the cold Kamchatka sea,
But now we're bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys, rolling down to old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui

Once more we sail with the northerly gale, towards our island home
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain't got far to roam
Our stu'n's'l booms is carried away, what care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us, thank God we're homeward bound!

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys, rolling down to old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui

How soft the breeze through the island trees, now the ice is far astern
Them native maids, them tropical glades, is awaiting our return
Even now their big brown eyes look out, hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails, running 'fore the gales, rolling down to old Maui

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys, rolling down to old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui

Rolling down to old Maui, me boys, rolling down to old Maui,
We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground, rolling down to old Maui"
193,Nick Drake,Strange Meeting II,TRUCKBD128F428F54A,1979,"Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand.

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand.

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand.

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone. of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand.

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and i'll hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sand."

I never wait, or hesitate
'Cause I love the life I live, I'm gonna live the life I choose
You gotta understand
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues 

All of my life I've had the same reputation
I've been the black sheep of the family all along
I never know if in my heart I'm really guilty
But I've been accused of never knowing right from wrong 

Everyday I realize, you can see it in my eyes
I never wait or hesitate
'Cause I love the life I live, gonna live the life I choose, yeah

I'm walking in the shadow of the blues

He said what you gonna do?
I left with my guitar and said
I'll leave it up to you

I'm gonna live the life I love
And live the life I choose, yeah
And I'm walking in the shadow of the blues, huh

I love the blues, they tell my story
If you don't feel it I will tell you once again
All of my life I've been caught up in a crossfire
'Cause I've been branded with the devil mark of cain

It was cold in the night (It was cold, it was night)
I was with you some time ago
But you were laughing to hide your crying (You were laughing and you were crying)
In shock and dazed, we walked away (The night was black, it was raining)
You said ""be careful"", some lights were shining
They came much closer, we started hiding
Then it was silent, I heard you breathing
But far away, someone was screaming

Some dogs were growling, we started running
We kept on running until the daylight
And it was cold, the smoke was heavy (And it was cold, it was night)
Casualties high, no one was ready (I was with you some time ago)

It was cold in the night
I was with you some time ago
You said now no in desperation (You said ""be careful"", some lights were shining)
The world we know in desolation (They came much closer, we started hiding)"

200,Pierangelo Bertoli,Srotolando Parole,TRHTISC128E07966FD,1979,"(B.Marro - P.A.Bertoli) 

Il sole traccia trappole di luce, arabeschi di colori 
Le case dei guardiani della mente sono piene di valori 
Srotolando le parole 
Scoppiano frontiere di calore 
Mentre sui mondi di pellicola sostano tutte le navi 
E sulle piazze del presente c'è il mercato degli schiavi. 

Il tempo degli errori si è concluso e non mi sento di tornare 
Sotto le macerie del passato c'è ben poco da salvare 
Io che ho cercato di comprendere 
Io che ancora non mi voglio arrendere 
Io che ho creduto nelle favole e sono rimasto da solo 
Sono sicuro solamente che a sbagliare sono loro. 

Nell'alba nata male ammalata di ricordi 
Di ciechi che volevano vedere, di cervelli nati sordi 
Sulle miserie stese al sole 
Lanciavano torrenti di parole 
Di discussioni interminabili, di libri messi al posto dei cannoni 
E di giochi intellettuali senza senso e senza fine e condizioni. 

Così che combattendo con discorsi troppo grandi da capire 
Avendo come pubblico quei pochi che potevano sentire 
Contrabbandando la ragione 
Hanno creato solo confusione 
Solo un passato da comprendere e adesso tutto è tutto da rifare 
E l'unica speranza che rimane è che non debbano tornare. 

La vita lentamente ha dipanato i suoi sentieri 
Confuso le mie strade con le altre, i domani con i ieri 
Io che ho cercato un altro tempo 
Io che sono sempre contro vento 
Io che non cerco di nascondermi e urlo davanti alla porta 
Rimango fermo qui a pensare che la vita non è morta."

Past the rings of Jupiter, canals of Mars

Past the edge of time in our universe
It's an endless flight on an unknown course
Though a million lifetimes yet to come
Fly the crystal ships and children of the Sun

Through colours man has never seen
To places man can never dream
On shafts of light the ships are spinnin'

Stasera ho chiesto al caso 
Che cosa devo fare 
Sono stanco del mio ruolo 
E ho voglia di cambiare 
Non so se andare avanti 
O se e' il caso di scappare 
O se e' solo il bisogno 
Di un nuovo sogno da sognare. 

Adesso che ho quello 
Che ho sempre voluto 
Mi sento un tantino legato, 
Vorrei sparire 
Per ricominciare da capo 
Con un nuovo mazzo di carte 
Un nuovo gioco. 

Ma il libro mi ha detto: 
""Tieni la testa a posto, 
Datti una regolata e 
Guarda bene dentro te stesso, 
Non giudicare gli altri 
E cerca invece di capire, 
Butta via lo specchio 
Che c'e' il mondo da guardare"" 

Vorrei essere come l'acqua 
Che si lascia andare, 
Che scivola su tutto, 
Che si fa assorbire, 
Che supera ogni ostacolo 
Finche' non raggiunge il mare 
E li si ferma a meditare 
Per scegliere 
Se esser ghiaccio o vapore, 
Se fermarsi o 
Se ricominciare..."

Life is new and there's things to be done
You can't wait to be grown up
Acceptance into the capital world
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young

But you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end

But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time

You're fearless and brave - you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say ""it's fun""

And you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to understand
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam

It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn

Judging by the things you do
If only you could see the tears of pain
In the eyes of the world

Dust to dust by the million
Broken dreams in the ground
Aching hearts in the heartbeats of hope
When their spirits are down
Evil takes, evil kills
With no shame or concern
Killing me, killing you
Watch the end of the burn

Maybe you don't understand
We don't need you anymore
If only you could see the tears of pain

For the hate in our soul
For the blind and the sick in the heart

To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life"

But I just can't hide it.

The loneliness will show.

And the small fame that you've acquired
Has brought you into cult status
But to me you're still a collector

There's tarts and whores but you're much more
You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds
And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride
It's just a face on your pillowcase
That thrills you

And you started looking much older
And your fashion sense is second rate like your perfume
But to you in your little dream world
You're still the queen of the butterfly collectors

As you carry on 'cause it's all you know
You can't light a fire
You can't cook or sew
You get from day to day by filling your head
But surely you must know the appeal between your legs
Has worn off

And I don't care about morals
'Cause the world's insane and we're all to blame anyway
And I don't feel any sorrow
Towards the kings and queens of the butterfly collectors

So che cos'hai

ma chi ti vedrà

Vedo il tuo dolore

odi chi passerà

comprerà

And there's smoke you could click on
 
What are we going to do now?

Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown

We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

The judge said five to ten but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown

Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
Do you know that you can use it?

The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you

The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy, get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

You grow up and you calm down
And you're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
And you're working for the clampdown

So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now

In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown

Ha, get along, get along
Working for the clampdown
Ha, get along, get along
Working for the clampdown

Working hard in Petersburg
Working for the clampdown
Working for the clampdown

The words don't come so easy but I'm trying
I'm searching for a melody or some forgotten line
They can slip away from us so quickly
Don't be unkind I'm not complaining
I only feel it needs explaining

(Chorus)
Though I've said it all before I'll say it once again (one more time)
Everyone needs something to believe in

So turn around, turn around it's on the other side
Feel the sound, feel the sound, it's coming from deep inside
It will fill you with emotion, if you let it be your guide so
Turn around; turn around, it's on the other side

I'm waiting for the day to end another to begin
Somehow I've forgotten what it stood for
I look into your face and see the searching in your eyes
I will he your servant till the end
The music plays, and for a moment I feel
That all there days an so fulfilling

(Chorus)

Desperation shows its ugly face in many ways
No one can escape the times we live in
The answers are so simple and we all know where to look
But it's easier to just avoid the question
And if I seem too inconclusive
It's just because it's so elusive

The heart that breaks the dawn.

And every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock and roll
Grabs the mic to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
That he who fucks nuns will later join the church

And you say OK
Don't wanna play the show
And all the while you're thinking:

Playin' the blues with pennies
Sure looks better now

Every dragging hand clap over every dragging beat
That's just the beat of time, the beat that must go on

247,Tommy Collins,You Better Not Do That,TRYWBGW128F9300D09,1979,"I'm just a plain ol' country kid and I like to do what's right
But just like any other boy I like to hold 'em tight
Sometimes I got resistence, but no matter how I try
When a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I say ""You better not do that"", and she say ""Why?""
And I say ""Because you just better not do that""

When I was in the country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satified
I'd say ""Honey, you better not do that"" and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

(Instrumental Break)

When I was a little older, I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun, I wasn't thinkin' about romance
But the dim lights just lured 'em on and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long, 'cos I'm human you see
And I'd say ""Baby, you better not do that"", and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

Now that's the way my life has been, ain't it a cryin' shame
How much longer can I last if I keep playin' a game
Sometimes I don't know who I am, don't they know what they're doin'
I'm afraid in years to come that girls will be my ruin
And I'll say ""Now honey, you better not do that"", and she'll
say ""Why?""
And I'll say ""You just better not do that"", and she'll say ""Why-y-y?""
And I'll say ""Oh...well...oh...aah...oh...well it's alright if you do that"""

And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind

So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?

Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You

And I think I'm fading fast
It's complete, I won't weep
Though I see my life flashing past.

With all the things I wanted to do
And all the places that I've never seen
All the love I should have given to you
And all the things that might have been.

Don't let time catch you empty handed
Bitter and resentful at the end
But take these dying words as an example
They're easy enough to comprehend.

I'm too weak and can't sleep
So .....................................
And write words and set it to music
But it's a song that someone else will have to sing.

Like all the songs I should have been singing
All these years in my ears they were ringing
It's too late, yes, I understand
It's not too late for another man.

Don't let time catch you empty handed
Bitter and resentful at the end
So take these dying words as an example
They're easy enough to comprehend.

Don't let time catch you empty handed

Tell me of the way of things and how such beauty
Can divide our hearts and hands while holding
Out so closely now.
King of kings will oversee the dawning of truth
The overworld, pain is borne as love surrenders
Higher ever higher ever true to you.

Rain will fall and wash us evermore beside the

Everflowing ease.

Full of open hearts, turned to stone.
All together, all alone.
All at once, my whole world had changed.
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall,
Lit the strobe light up the wall.
I close my eyes, and dance til dawn.

Dance away the heartache,
Dance away, tears.
Dance away the heartache,
Dance away, fears.
Dance away...
Dance away...
Dance away...

Now I know, I must walk the line
Until i find an open door,
Off the street or onto the floor.
There was I, many times a fool,
I hoped and prayed, but not too much,
Out of reach is out of touch,
All the way is far enough.

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Is there anybody there who feels that vibration
Who shows me the way to my love
Is there anybody there with that inclination
To bring back to sun to my heart

Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion
Where's a place that I can stay

When you're in my arms I'm a king on a throne
But when we're apart I walk the streets alone
One day happiness
The next day, loneliness

When love brings so much joy why must it bring such pain
Guess it's a mystery that nobody can explain

Maybe I'm a fool to keep on loving you

I want you though I know that

Take a look around you
Is it true what they say

Life in a day
Ooh, life in a day
Is there no place to hide
Could there be some other way

Can you see how they run
Do you believe what they say
They'll soon be looking for you
For sure they'll get you away

The premonition came true
Look all around and you'll see
Some say it takes two to know
Or could it all just be me

Our loving is over, 
To lose that love was such a shame, 
Remember then, then, then, then, then, 
Remember then, then, then, then, then. 

Our love is in the past, 
Why has it gone so fast, 
Why couldn't our love last.

Since we have parted now,

Is another stupid question

Don't deny that I show disrespect
Ask me why I don't change the subject
Justify, but it has no effect
My reply is that I've been ship-wrecked

You try to be sly but you're so overt
And you know the main objection
If the passionate pressure that you exert
In the opposite direction

I'm afraid that it seems evident
though you stayed, now it's time that you went
Don't persuade me with your blandishment

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: ""Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said: ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been!""

Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil finished Johnny said:
""Well, you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said: ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
'Cause I've told, you once you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been!""

And he played Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough

I remember that night we were together
sharing Jah love with one another.
Those nights I can't forget
Lord knows I did sweat.

Abortion, abortion. You got to have caution.

Due a minor strain of contraceptive
blood vessel bursts in their brain.
Oh what a shame! Oh what a strain!
To see my black sisters going down the drain.

Abortion, abortion. You got to have caution.
Abortion, abortion. You got to have caution.

A woman was made from the rib of a man
to multiply and not to divide.
So leave your pills and thrills
and your world of sodomy.
Show unto yourself woman no sympathy.

Abortion, abortion. You got to have caution.
You got to have caution.

Throw away the pills

So you ask me what do I see
When I look into your eyes
I see things that have never existed before

Shall I tell you all that I find
In those beautiful eyes I can try
But it never existed before

A silvery moon... a will in the park
The tunnel of love... a kiss in the dark
The light of the stars... the clouds in the sky
The fireworks on the fourth of july


And you ask me what do I hear
When you whisper my name
Music plays that has never existed before
Oh, and I don't know why
But it's there just the same
And it's plain that it never existed before

The song of the rain on flowers in spring
The wind in the willow trees murmuring
The laughter that falls the children at play
Like church bells that call all the people to pray

So you ask me why do I glow
Well, I think you should know
I'm in love and I never existed before"

Tell the truth
