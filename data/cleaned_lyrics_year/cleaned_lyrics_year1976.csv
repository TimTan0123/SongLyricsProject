0,John Denver,Leaving On A Jet Plane,TRLDYNY128F428A239,1976,"All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I let you down
So many times I've played around 
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
But I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go"
1,Patti Smith Group,Pissing In A River,TRFVEDB128F4293508,1976,"Pissing in a river, watching it rise 
Tattoo fingers shy away from me 
Voices voices mesmerize 
Voices voices beckoning sea 
Come come come come back come back 
Come back come back come back 

Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon 
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free. 
When are you coming ? Hope you come soon 
Fingers, fingers encircling thee 
Come come come come come come 
Come come come come come come for me oh 

My bowels are empty, excreting your soul 
What more can I give you ? Baby I don't know 
What more can I give you to make this thing grow? 
Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you 

Should I pursue a path so twisted ? 
Should I crawl defeated and gifted ? 
Should I go the length of a river 
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river] 
Everything I've done, I've done for you 
Oh I give my life for you. 
Every move I made I move to you, 
And I came like a magnet for you now. 

What about it, you're gonna leave me, 
What about it, you don't need me, 
What about it, I can't live without you, 
What about it, I never doubted you 
What about it ? What about it ? 
What about it ? What about it ? 

Should I pursue a path so twisted ? 
Should I crawl defeated and gifted ? 
Should I go the length of a river, 
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river] 
What about it, what about it, what about it ? 
Oh, I'm pissing in a river."

3,Elton John / Kiki Dee,Don't Go Breaking My Heart,TRLXPMB128EF342C12,1976,"Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Uh honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off of me
Oh honey, when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

Hoo hoo, nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Hoo hoo, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
Oh oh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
Now it's up to us, babe
Whoa, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I got your heart in my sights

Hoo hoo, nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Hoo hoo, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
But right from the start
I gave you my heart

4,Jaco Pastorius,Come On_ Come Over,TRHEFKG128F4273E9C,1976,"Come on, come over
As fast as you can
You're afraid that you won't like it
But you don't understand

One thing, my brother
I can tell you true
The more time you spend feeling happy
The less time you'll be blue

Come on, come over
Everyone's waiting on you
We're wondering when you'll get tired
Of wondering what to do

There is something here that cannot be denied
Get on the floor, get on down
Don't knock it until you try

Come on, come over
The pleasure is all mine
Music's playin', the door just opened
You don't have to stand in line

People of the world
Have been uptight far too long
While you're busy making stands
Everybody's making plans
To move on, move right along"
5,Thin Lizzy,Whiskey In The Jar,TRPQDEV128F428A02E,1976,"As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, ""Stand and deliver, or the devil he may take you!""

Musha ring dum a doo dam a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dam a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my Molly with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels

Musha ring dum a do dam a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like to hear the cannon ball a-roarin'
Me, I like sleepin', 'specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a do dam a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o"
6,Bad Company,Honey Child,TRVWQEV128F932799A,1976,"Well, the first time that I met you, You were only seventeen, 
But I had to put you down, 'Cause I didn't know where you'd been.
You had a long black dress, Your hair in a mess,
You didn't seem to have no class, But the look on 
your face was no disgrace, I knew I had to move real fast.

Honey Child, Don't you know you drive me wild! Oh, Honey Child, 
Don't you know you drive me wild! Just about to lose my mind.

Well the second time that I met you, You were just turned 
twenty-one, An' all your talk about love, Love was gone, long gone.

Oh, Honey Child, Don't you know you drive me wild! Honey child, 


Don't you know you drive me wild! Just about to lose my mind.
Yeah, yeah.

Oh, honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild, mm. 
Honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild. Honey child, 
Don't you know you drive me wild. Oh, yeah, honey child, 
Don't you know you drive me wild. Oh, oh, honey child, 
Don't you know you drive me wild. Honey child, now, 
Don't you know you drive me wild, Yeah, yeah.
Honey, honey, honey, honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild."
7,Hello,New York Groove,TRMNQYY128F92D0D7A,1976,"It's been a year since I was here
On the street I'm just passing my time away
To the left and to the right a town of stone grows to the sky
And it's out of sight in a fading light

Here I am again in the city
With a fist full of dollars
And baby, you better believe

I'm back
Back in the New York groove
I'm back
Back in the New York groove
I'm back
Back in the New York groove
I'm back in the New York groove, in the New York groove

In the back of a Cadillac
With a lady by my side tell you where I'll be
Stop at third and forty-three
Dance into the night
It's gonna be ecstasy
This day was made for me

I feel so good tonight
Who cares about tomorrow?

I'm back (New York groove)
Back in the New York groove (New York groove)
I'm back (New York groove)
Back in the New York groove (New York groove)

la lana e l'amianto

""Anvedi che santo vestito d'amianto"".
E Berta filava e filava con Mario

9,Tony Bennett,Stranger In Paradise,TRAAAJO12903CAAC69,1976,"Take my hand, 
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed, 
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside 
An angel like you
I saw your face, 
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended 
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms 
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more"
10,Stan Rogers,Barrett's Privateers,TRJRNQS128F42201EA,1976,"Oh, the year was 1778, 
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
A letter of marque came from the King,
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Oh Elcid Barrett, cried the town,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She'd a list to the port and and her sails in rags,
And the cook in scuppers with the staggers and jags

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the King's birthday we put to sea,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay,
Pumping like madmen all the way

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Yankee lay low down with gold,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Then at length we stood two cables away,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now --
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the main truck carried off both me legs

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

So here I lay in my twenty-third year,
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been six years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday!

God damn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears --
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers"
11,Uriah Heep,Make A Little Love,TRWFWBG12903CD139B,1976,"I walked you to your doorstep
Believin' we could make a little love
And I let you have my heart
I was as certain as the stars above

Looked here and there
Every everywhere
I even searched beyond the dawn
But you were nowhere to be found
And I was going round and round
Lost like I'd never been born

Time after time
I've lost my love for a rhyme
A reason seemed good enough
You always put me down
While you made me run around
I can't take anymore of that stuff

Time after time
I've lost my love for a rhyme
And my reason
Seemed good enough
You always put me down
And you make me run around
I can't take anymore of that stuff"
12,Be Bop Deluxe,Sleep That Burns,TRZKMRX128F145B1F8,1976,"Nelson

A brass band is playing, rehearsing it's thrills,
All half-moon and cloudy, all golden and shrill . . . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . . .
Got a sleep that burns all night. 
I'm locked in your dark world
where hearts hold the keys,
Half-opened, enchanted, half-truth and half dreams . . . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . . .
Got a sleep that burns all night. 
I'm sitting in a cafe in paradise . . .
Naked as a razor, I'm as loaded as a dice . . .
The waitresses all ask me for my price,
I laugh and say I'm leaving and this is only dreaming,
So hold me while I'm screaming . . . 
Now . . . ! Is the moment of truth . . .
Your youth is a mask but it's not made to last
For we all have a past to out run
when the mask comes undone
And we race on and on
through the fiery portals of hell . . . ! 
Go and tell all your friends
that you've witnessed the end
of the world in a dream . . . 
The night winds are howling . . . seducing the trees,
I wake in a cold sweat
with the sheets 'round my knees . . . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . . .
Got a sleep that burns all night. 
I lay in the darkness with visionless eyes . . .
Exhausted and reeling . . . all heartbeats and sighs . . . 
But the sleep still burns, yes, the sleep still burns,
Got a sleep that burns all night . . .
(sleep is coming, don't you worry . . .)"
13,Flying Burrito Brothers,Close Up The Honky Tonks,TRNXFMB128F4248969,1976,"She's in some honky tonk tonight, I know
She's dancing where the music's loud and the lights are low
In a crowded bar, she likes to hang around
But as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle down

So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

I wish I had the power to turn back the time
And live again the hours when she was all mine
'Cause it hurts to see her running with that crowd downtown
But as long as there's a honky tonk, she'll never settle down

So close up the honky tonks, lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks, throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me"

15,Nino Bravo,Libre,TRVHWUW128F42155B0,1976,"Tiene casi 20 años
y ya esta cansado de soñar,
pero tras la frontera está su hogar
su mundo y su ciudad.

Piensa que la alambrada sólo es
un trozo de metal
algo que nunca puede detener
sus ansias de volar

ESTRIBILLO

Libre,
como el sol cuando amanece
yo soy libre, como el mar.
Libre,
como el ave que escapó
de su prisión
y puede al fin volar.
Libre,
como el viento que recoge
mi lamento y mi pesar
camino sin cesar
detrás de la verdad
y sabré lo que es al fin
la libertad.

Con su amor por bandera
se marchó
cantando una canción.
Marchaba tan feliz que no escuchó
la voz que le llamó.

Y tendido en suelo se quedó
sonriendo y sin hablar
sobre su pecho flores carmesí
brotaban sin cesar.

ESTRIBILLO"

and a body like a tiger tiger (uh huh, uh huh)
She was looking at me 

Now you know that I ain't no dancer
But there's gotta be a way to meet her
So I just walked up to her and said
Are you hot to trot? 

Well I knew I was looking cool
Pretty sharp like a razor razor (uh huh, uh huh)
She was smiling at me 

So I said if you got the notion
We could take a little trip to the ocean
She said that'll be OK
'Cause I'm hot to trot 

We were having a ball by the water
Talking about life and philosophizing (uh huh, uh huh)
She was really talking to me 

She said I can't understand why you gotta hustle
Struttin' and posin' and flexin' muscle
So I said, well that's easy baby
I'm hot to trot"
17,Wishbone Ash,Runaway,TRQVWVZ128F4272379,1976,"I thought I had been every place a man could be,
'Till I met a lady who brought me to my knees.
The day I stop loving is the day that I die,
But now I'm running from her game 'cause the lady is a lie. 

I've got a choice
Run away or be torn to shreds.
I've got a life and I want to live
Don't want to be dead. 

I met her down in the underground,
Got a taste of the low life, just creepin' around.
I got what I came for and more, that's for sure,
'Cause now I'm running from her game, can't take any more. 

I've got a choice
Run away or be torn to shreds.
I've got a life and I want to live
Don't want to be dead. 

When I first met you, baby,
I knew you could come on strong.
But when you held a knife to me,
You know, that just ain't too friendly.
I've heard of liberated,
But that's so understated.
I should have listened to them
When they told me you were crazy
And you said I was a runaway."

Just beneath the Great White Way
Alfred Beach worked secretly
Risking all to ride a dream
His wind machine
His wind machine

New York City and the morning sun
Were awoken by the strangest sound
Reportedly as far as Washington
The tremors shook the earth as Alfie
Blew underground
Blew underground
He blew underground

Ahh, all aboard sub-rosa subway
Had you wondered who's been digging under Broadway?
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
It's Alfred
Poor Al, oh no, Al

As for America's first subway
The public scoffed, ""it's far too rude""
One station filled with Victoria's age
From frescoed walls and goldfish fountains

Ette osaa muuta kuin verottaa

Kaikki pitäis kerralla erottaa

On siinä meillä omituinen sakki
Kaikki sitä johto hommiin pääseekin
On nyt jo tyhjä joka jätkän takki
Mutta verotus vain jatkuu hurjemmin

On aivan turhaa enää tehdä työtä
Verot vievät koko palkan kuitenkin
Saat viettää monta unetonta yötä
Herrat teki elämästä helvetin

Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta
Ette osaa muuta kuin verottaa
Muutenkin touhu tuntuu holtittomalta
Kaikki pitäis kerralla erottaa

On herrain helppo lakejansa lyödä
Sillä ei ne niitä koske kuitenkaan
On hauska edustaa ja lounaat syödä
Kansa lystin kustantaa kun hommaillaan

Ja kun on verorahat kaikki juotu
Kansa kyllä pikku vipin järjestää
Vain päätös niin on lisävero luotu
Sillä lailla kassahuolet selviää

Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta

A secret rendezvous they planned for days.
A sea of faces in a crowded cafe,
A sound of laughter as the music plays.

Jean-Claude was a student at the University,
Louise-Marie is just a world away.
He recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words were music as she turned away.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...
But Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...

Each cigarette would light a thousand faces,
Each hour that pass seem like a thousand years.
Midnight was turning into empty spaces
The sound of laughter disappeared.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...
Oh, but Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...

A summer morning on Les Champs Elyses,
The empty table in the street cafe.
The sunlight melting through an open doorway,
Jean-Claude has left to face another day.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,

The sky's the only place to hide.
And as I floated in the moonlit night
You arrived to take me home.
I kissed your hand and I came back to life
And all the wrong became all right.

In all of my dreams
You rescue me
It always seems you rescue me.

I was wandering down endless roads
A fallen angel in the cold.
You appeared before me like a vision
To whisper love I used to know.
So easily you gave to me secret promises
Like only magic words can flow.

Das coisas que aprendi nos discos
Quero lhe contar como vivi
E tudo que aconteceu comigo
Viver é melhor que sonhar
Eu sei que o amor é uma coisa boa
Mas também sei que qualquer canto 
É menor do que a vida de qualquer pessoa

Por isso cuidado meu bem
Há perigo na esquina
Eles venceram
E o sinal está fechado prá nós que somos jovens
Para abraçar seu irmão e beijar sua menina na rua
É que se fez o seu braço, o seu lábio e a sua voz

Você me pergunta pela minha paixão
Digo que estou encantada com uma nova invenção
Eu vou ficar nesta cidade, não vou voltar pro sertão
Pois vejo vir vindo no vento, o cheiro da nova estação
Eu sei de tudo na ferida viva do meu coração
Já faz tempo que eu vi você na rua
Cabelo ao vento, gente jovem reunida
Na parede da memória
Essa lembrança é o quadro que dói mais

Minha dor é perceber
Que apesar de termos feito tudo que fizemos
Aínda somos os mesmos e vivemos
Aínda somos os mesmos e vivemos
Como nossos pais

Nossos ídolos ainda são os mesmos 
E as aparências não enganam não
Você diz que depois deles
Não apareceu mais ninguém
Você pode até dizer que eu 'tô por fora
Ou então que eu 'tô inventando
Mas é você que ama o passado e que não vê
É você que ama o passado e que não vê
Que o novo sempre vem

Hoje eu sei que quem me deu a idéia
De uma nova consciência e juventude
Tá em casa guardado por Deus contando vil metal
Minha dor é perceber
Que apesar de termos feito tudo, tudo, tudo que fizemos
Ainda somos os mesmos e vivemos
Ainda somos os mesmos e vivemos
Ainda somos os mesmos e vivemos
Como nossos pais"

Hand's on the plow and my feet's in the ghetto

Stand up, sit down

Stuffin' down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rockin' the streets

I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me 
Is the prarie and the sky

I don't wanna hear your sad story
About heartache and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain, in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive 
I have come to listen for the sound 
Of the trucks as they move down 
Out on highway ninety five 
And pretend that it's the ocean 
coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
Baby do you know what I mean

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

sento in alto il grido 
delle aquile nel cielo che volteggiano. 
Aquile vigili 
scrutano, controllano 
che mai nessuno pensi 
di scegliere tra sonno e libertà. 
Corri, mangia, dormi, non pensare 
non cercare nuove verità 
non tentare di sfuggire 
tanto sai che un' aquila ti prenderà.

Your greedy, seedy,

You . . . and your dancin shoes,
You . . . and your sad glad news,
about your boyfriend Stan . . .
He's a dirty flirty man . . .
and he'll get you if he can . . . 
Here I stand in a daze, axe in my hand,
Another fool on the stage with a traveling band,
There's a space in my heart . . . permanent flame,
Just give me your body and I'll give you my brain,
it's a fair exchange . . . 
Now Venus-De-Milo, a statue of note,
she lays in the gutter
With a knife in her throat . . . naked as sin,
no, not even a coat,
She gave you a thrill so you gave her a grope,

Still, I expect you expect a lot from me,
I know you all . . .
The show goes on despite the wrong,
the strong still rise
And the weak still fall,

even though it almost lied . . ."

Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy

Oh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better
I'm funkin' out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin', no I won't

I vanished in the air
Am I still there
Wake me gently
If you can	Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve

Is where I want to leave
And in my sleep
I look so lifeless on this bed
Laid out on satin sheets
This dream's a novel
That I don't dare complete
No happy ending read
I think the hero's dead
Wake me gently

Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve

Is where I want to leave
Me to my slumber
And I'll never come home
Please help me, I'm frightened
Of what's going on
What's going on
And if I can't wake up	Will I be all alone
A stranded orphan here
Or will I bump into
Some other wandering soul
And will they talk to me
Somebody, somebody please rescue me
Wake me gently
If you can
Wake me gently
Just touch my hand
Wake me gently
Pull my sleeve

She's gone and I know, that the pain is beginnin' to show, I'm hurting inside.
My world fell apart, but love's still burning in my heart, but where can I hide?

Love turned to stone, and I'm tired of bein' alone,
Yeah, burnin' the midnight oil - Yeah, burnin' the midnight oil.

There's a voice in my head runnin' over everything she said, and I can't erase it.
Love was a game, well I lost and it's a cryin' shame, but I gotta face it.

Nowhere to go, and time is moving slow,

With new life pushing through
That I looked from the citadel down to the narrows and asked what it's coming to
I saw Upper Canadian concrete and glass
right down to the water line
I have heard an old song down on Fisherman's Wharf
Can I sing it just one time?

With half-closed eyes against the sun
for the warm wind giving thanks
I dreamed of the years of the deep laden schooners splashing home from the Grand Banks
The last lays done in the harbor sun
With her picture on a dime
But I have heard an old song down on Fisherman's Wharf
Can I sing it just one time?
CHORUS:
And haul away and heave her ho
This song is heard no more
No boats to sing it for
No sails to sing it for
There rises now a single tide of tourists passing through
We traded old ways for the new
Old ways for the new,
Old ways for the new, for the new

Now you ask ""What's this romantic boy,
Who laments what's done and gone?""
There was no romance on a cold winter ocean and the gale sang an awful song
But my fathers knew of wind and tide, and my blood is maritime
And I heard an old song down on Fisherman's Wharf
Can I sing it just one time?

Christy Moore

In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn't a shilling.
His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea. 
Nolans and Dolans and all the O'Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
While songs went round as plenty as water,
The harps that are sounded through Tara's old hall,
Biddie Grey and the rat catcher's daughter singing away at Lanigan's ball.

CHORUS

Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan's ball.
She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan's ball.


They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
I spent six months in Brook's Academy learning to dance for Lanigan's ball.
Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
Dancing around in their couples and groups.
An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
He put his boot through Miss Finnerty's hoops.
She fell down in a faint and cried, 'Holy murder!'
Called her brothers and gathered them all.
Carmody swore he'd go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan's ball.

CHORUS

Boys oh boys 'tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
Moloney the piper was near gettin' smothered.
They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan's ball.

Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!

Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!

And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I knew a girl so gloomy
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
And put on a happy, happy face
Put on a happy, happy, happy face
Oh, come on bubby, smile its your birthday"

Libby, we’ll go to Paris
Dance along the boulevards
And have no one to embarrass
Puttin’ on the Ritz in style 
With an Arab and an Heiress
Libby, we’ll fly anyway, heyyyy
And leave behind our blues
Half sung melodies
We'll trade them all in
For a Paris breeze
Libby we’ll fly

See how dark the circles grow
In a town that has no light
So many eyes just staring out
Into the bloodshot night
And Libby, I hate to see you cry
And I want to share it all with you
And if it brings us to our knees
We’ll trade it all in for a Paris breeze
Libby we’ll fly

They say it don’t come easy
And they say that love is blind
If you’re afraid to be close
Then love is hard to find
And if you spend too much time winning love
There’s no time to be kind
And Libby I’m guilty of your crimes
I’m just another passenger
Traveling on these crazy high seas
Very likely be the same
In a Paris breeze
Libby we’ll fly

If all our flights are grounded
Libby we’ll go to Paris
And wish we were back home again
Or sailing on the ocean
Just a window and a drink
To set our dreams in motion
But Libby, we’ll fly anyway, heyyyy
And leave our blues
Half sung melodies
Trade them in for a Paris breeze
Libby we’ll fly"

95,Harry Chapin,The Mayor Of Candor Lied (LP Version),TRDVJIL128F4292CB9,1976,"In the little town of Candor in the last year of my youth
I learned the final lesson of the levels to the truth
My father was a farmer he'd go tilling in the ground
My mother was a neighbor she'd go visiting around.

But I didn't care.
For I had found the answer to a plowboy's lonely prayer.
She was the daughter of the Mayor.

The Mayor fought my courtship for he'd made other plans
He saw her married to a better man than a boy with farmer's hands.
I said -- I hate your father, it's so hard not to strike him.
She said --You know I love you because you're so much like him.

And so I'd go sneaking in the evening
And there she'd stand a crying in the dawn as I was leaving

But the Mayor of Candor lied
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter.

One day with father on his tractor and mother off again
I go to find the mayor and work out what I can
But he is not at his office, he is not at his home
When I find him in the countryside he is not alone

He is holding a woman and imagine my surprise
As she jumps back from his arms I look into my mother's eyes

All my thoughts of outrage, embarrassment and pain
Were washed away by what came roaring through my brain
The Mayor's at my mercy and I hear my own voice say --
Your run for re-election is just one month away.

And the world will never know of what I've seen here sir
But I'll be with your daughter is my meaning clear?

My mother looks in horror at the compromise we made
But the Mayor's rueful smile says the piper must be paid
I had a month of joy in heaven from this deal I'd made in hell
What was to happen then my friend a prophet could not tell

The day after his re-election and the victory celebration
The Mayor takes his family on a month long foreign vacation

Oh Coleen -- you know how much I love you
There is no one I'd ever place above you
Oh Coleen -- you don't even know me
To have you there's nothing that's below me.

But time always passes after all
And as the summer follows spring so does the winter follow fall

The day that they return I stand waiting on the road
I watch the car drive up I watch the passengers unload
Of course she isn't there of course I should have known
The Mayor says that she has stayed the decision was her own.

I spit out my hatred and my fury at his lies
When he says you tried to blackmail me you're just as bad as I
He says -- Go and do your damndest, throw your mother to the streets
You know it's been too many years I had to be discreet

And as he stands there saying we're just two of a kind
It hits me like a thunderbolt exploding in my mind

As I look into his leering aged wrinkled mirror of my own face
He laughs and sneers and says -- Of course dear son --
Where do you think you came from in the first place?

The Mayor of Candor lied 
When he offered me his only daughter
The Mayor of Candor tried 
To take her across the water
What a thing to do to a young man in love
What a thing to do to your daughter."

I've got to hide what's killing me inside

97,Billy Joel,Prelude/Angry Young Man,TRTMILI128F4267237,1976,"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl,
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost,
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.

Give a moment or two to the angry young man,
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand.
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood,
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good.
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door,
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.

I believe I've passed the age
Of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight.
I once believed in causes too,
I had my pointless point of view,
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right.

And there's always a place for the angry young man,
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand.
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes,
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks.
But his honor is pure and his courage as well,
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man.

Yes, there's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl,
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost,
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man."

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine!""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in their masters' chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax"", said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave"""

Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say, ""I'm easy come, yeah, and I'm easy go
And easy to love when I stay""

Left snow on the mountain, raised hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum, and a son-of-a-gun
And a hobo with stars in my crown

Won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down?
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say, ""I'm easy come, yeah, and I'm easy go
And easy to love when I stay""

Won't you ride me down easy, Lord, ride me on down?
Leave word in the dust where I lay

And easy to love when I stay"""

How did it feel? How did it feel?
When shepherds and kings with precious things adored him
it had begun, here was the one.

Down from a gleaming heaven, I can hear the voices call
When you comin' home now, son, the World is not for you
Tell me what's you point of view

Hey there Mister Madman, wat'cha know that I don't know
Tell me some crazy stories, let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing, he turns and walks away
Tell me what made you that way

Here I am just waiting for a sign
Asking questions, learning all the time
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love, and miracles out of nowhere

Tell me now dear Mother, what's it like to be so old
Children grown and leavin', seems the world is growin' cold
And though your body's ailin' you, your mind is just like new
Tell me where you're goin' to

It's so simple right before your eyes
If you'll only look through this disguise
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere

I sang this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the western heroes do
Tell me what you're gonna do

Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life I knew that it was mine
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere"

Me, shine on me
Let it shine on
Shine on
All I have to do is let it shine on

Please look about and tell me what you see
All noise and dirt and plastic people
Cause love is clean
And ours has been a bluer shade of jade
Than black or white is

Take me on a ride, girl

115,Christy Moore,Little Musgrave,TRFOBSK128F92F7C36,1976,"It fell upon a holy day as many are in the year
Musgrave to the church did go to see fine ladies there.
Some were dressed in velvet red and some in velvet pale,
Then in came Lord Barnard's wife the fairest among them all.
She cast an eye on Little Musgrave as bright as the summer's sun,
Said Musgrave unto himself this lady's heart I've won.
""I have loved you Fair Lady full long and many's the day.""
""And I have loved you Little Musgrave and never a word did say.
I have a bower in Bucklesfordberry its my heart's delight
I'll take you back there with me and lie in your arms all night.""
Standing by was a little foot page, from the Lady's coach he ran
""Although I am a lady's page I am Lord Barnard's man.
My Lord Barnard shall hear of this whether I sink or swim.""
And every where the bridge was broken he'd enter the water and swim.
""My Lord Barnard! My Lord Barnard! You are a man of life,
But Musgrave is at Bucklesfordberry asleep with your wedded wife.""
""If this be true my little foot page, this thing that you tell me,
All the gold in Bucklesfordberry I gladly will give to thee.
But if this be a lie my little foot page this thing that you tell me
From the highest tree in Bucklesfordberry hanged you will be.
Go saddle me the black!"" he said, ""Go saddle me the grey!
Sound you not your horns,"" he said, ""lest our coming it betray!""
But there was a man in Lord Barnard's train who loved the Little Musgrave
He blew his horn both loud and shrill. Away Musgrave, away! 
""I think I hear the morning cock, I think I hear the jay,
I think I hear Lord Barnard's men, I wish I was away.""
""Lie still, lie still, my Little Musgrave, and hug me from the cold,
it's nothing but a shepherd lad a bringing his flock to fold.
Is not your hawk upon its perch? Your steed eats oats and hay.
You a woman in your arms, why would you go away?""
So they turned around and they kissed twice and then they fell asleep.
When they awoke Lord Barnard's men were standing at their feet.
""How do you like my bed?"" he said, ""and how do you like my sheets?
How do you like my fair Lady that lies in your arms asleep?""
""It's well I like your bed he said. Great it gives me pain.
I'd gladly give a hundred pounds to be on yonder plain!""
""Rise up rise up, Little Musgrave, rise up and then put on.
It'll not be said in this country I slayed a naked man.""
So slowly, slowly he got up and slowly he put on,
Slowly he went down the stairs thinking he'd be slain.
""There are two swords by my side, dear they cost my purse,
You can take the best of them and I will take the worst.""
And the first stroke Little Musgrave struck it hurt Lord Barnard sore
But the next stroke Lord Barnard struck Little Musgrave ne'er struck more.
Then up spoke the lady fair from the bed whereon she lay,
""Although you're dead Little Musgrave, still for you I'll pray.""
""How do you like his cheeks?"" he said, ""How do you like his chin?
How do you like his dead body now there's no life within?""
""It's well I like those cheeks she cried and well I love that chin.
It's more I want that dead body than all your kith and kin!""
He's taken out his long, long sword to strike the mortal blow.
Through and through the Lady's heart the cold steel it did go.
""A grave! A grave!"" Lord Barnard cried, ""to put these lovers in!
With my lady on the upper hand, for she came from better kin.
For I've just killed the finest knight that ever rode a steed,
And I've just killed the finest woman that ever did a woman's deed!""
It fell upon a holy day as many are in the year
That Musgrave to the church did go to see fine ladies there."
116,Thin Lizzy,Massacre,TRLAQKU128F1463738,1976,"At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo

Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit is forced to yield

There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but doesn't care though
In fact he don't care at all

The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

If God is in the heavens
How can this happen here?
In his name they used the weapons
For the massacre

There's a point below zero
Where the sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lie dead beneath the sand"

She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire

Everybody turn when my baby walk by
She's something to see, she really catches the eye
I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree

Told my mama and a papa too
Just exactly what I wanna do
Wanna get married on a night in June
And boogie by the light of a silvery moon
I love her, she loves me

Can't even find a friend
Woah, my love, my love she's not waiting
Think I might've been gone, I've been gone too long
People make me crazy
I can hardly sing my song
Hustlers stand around me, 
I'm lost and all alone
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm lost ins the woods, I'm lost in the woods
Big city gamblers, gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time
Yes and your sweet, your sweet understanding
Cant' fix this broken heart of mine
The vultures fly around, come and take me home
Can't tell the bad from the good

I'm a man gone crazy in the woods
I'm wandering around the bush"
128,Van Der Graaf Generator,Masks (2005 Digital Remaster),TRUQGCG128E0794981,1976,"He's a man of the past and one of the present,
a man who hides behind a mask behind a mask;
a clown, a fool, believing it cool to be down
or that the game is all about who laughs the last.

So he tells all his problems to his friends and relations,
exposes his neuroses to their view.
They accept as fact every masochistic mumble of his act –
But how could they know what was false and what was true?

Sometimes when he wakes
he feels he's walked into a dream
but all it takes
to remind him things are what they seem
is the belief that the man behind the mask can really dance

Pirouetting smile
he feels himself cavorting,
Pierrot for a while
before aborting
to find relief in the shelter of the dark, most telling mask.

After all the pantomimes are ended
he peels all the make-up off his face
to reveal, beneath, the tears running all down his cheeks:
alone, he opens to the world… but it's much too late.
He's been left, in the end, without a face."

Paradise if you pay the price
Inlaid with love she satisfies.
She has to pray alone everyday,
Lying in wait for the whole wide world.

What a good thing that God made girls and boys.

Let the smooth side show
While you pull that load

Such a good thing that a man can see
What a good thing the Lord above has done.

Such a good thing we're not old for long
What a good thing that making love is fun.

Ooh, show me some affection
Ooh, give me some direction
Ooh, know you're my connection

Just a jet-age gypsy looking for a gypsy queen
I sometimes think I'm on the brink of knowing what I mean
Cities come and cities go but still I cannot find
A place to call a home when there's a woman on my mind

Ooh, show me some affection
Ooh, give me some direction
Ooh, know you're my connection

If hanging out with you was spent in hanging in
I'd still be out of time with time just waiting to begin
Have no preconceived ideas of how things have to be
I'll just take life as it comes and hope that it takes me

We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Getaway

Watch for the signs
That lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way
Into what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating

So come, take me by the hand,
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can getaway
Getaway

Lay awake every night
Till the sun comes up in the morning
Nothing exciting, it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
To your road, you just don't doubt it.

So come, take me by the hand,
We'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Getaway"

I just can't beg you anymore
I'm just gonna let you pass

I'm gonna last
'cause time will tell just who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're breaking and you're always aching
But you know how hard you try

Sometimes it gets so hard to care
You just can't be this way everywhere
I'm gonna let you pass

Well the judge he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

You say you're sorry for telling stories
That you know I believe are true

And I guess I believe you do

You say my kisses aren't like his

A single soul will go
Footsteps on the white

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come?
When the siren calls, you go
To run with the wolf

When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That a sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin

By the end of the rain
The feeling's passed again
From the things that snap and bite
An unholy light

There's a hole in the sky

Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long way
Such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day"

Ho! He! Ho! He! Headin' for the deep blue sea
I went down to the corner, just for to meet my pal
I found him talking on the sidewalk, talking to my gal
I went back to the bar room, to get another drink of gin
But the first thing I knew I was reeling, rocking drunk again

Ho! He! Ho! He! You're just as drunk as me
Ho! He! Ho! He! Headin' for the deep blue sea

I kept on drinking liquor, to way out in the night
My pal came into the bar room and we had an awful fight
I reached down for my razor and then we messed around
But when I drew my pistol, I quickly smoked him down

Hey! He! Hey! He! You're just as drunk as me
Hey! He! Hey! He! Headin' for the deep blue sea

So I headed on back to the bar room, stopping in at the bar
And there I met a policeman, sitting in a motor car
We kept drinking lots of liquor, that flat-footed cop, and I
I thought he would never leave me. I knew that he had to die
And I laid my head on the bar room floor

Never get drunk anymore
I pawned my watch, my golden chain
I pawned my baby's diamond ring

Hey! He! Hey! He! You're just as drunk as me

168,Bob Dylan,Isis,TRYJGMA128F92D1BE8,1976,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
But I could not hold on to her very long.
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.

I came to a high place of darkness and light.
The dividing line ran through the center of town.
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.

A man in the corner approached me for a match.
I knew right away he was not ordinary.
He said, ""Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?""
I said, ""I got no money."" He said, ""That ain't necessary.""

We set out that night for the cold in the North.
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word.
I said, ""Where are we goin'?"" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said, ""That's the best news that I've ever heard.""

I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold,
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace.
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.

How she told me that one day we would meet up again,
And things would be different the next time we wed,
If I only could hang on and just be her friend.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.

We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice.
He said, ""There's a body I'm tryin' to find.
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price.""
'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind.

The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious,
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had.
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly,
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed,
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.

She said, ""Where ya been?"" I said, ""No place special.""
She said, ""You look different."" I said, ""Well, I guess.""
She said, ""You been gone."" I said, ""That's only natural."" 
She said, ""You gonna stay?"" I said, ""If you want me to, yes.""

Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child.
What drives me to you is what drives me insane.
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain."

Nuvolari ha le mani come artigli, 
Nuvolari ha un talismano contro i mali 
Il suo sguardo è di un falco per i figli, 
I suoi muscoli sono muscoli eccezionali! 
Gli uccelli nell'aria perdono l'ali quando passa Nuvolari! 
Quando corre Nuvolari mette paura 
Perché il motore è feroce mentre taglia ruggendo la pianura 
Gli alberi della strada 
Strisciano sulla piana, 
Sui muri cocci di bottiglia 
Si sciolgono come poltiglia, 
Tutta la polvere è spazzata via! 
Quando corre Nuvolari, quando passa Nuvolari, 
La gente arriva in mucchio e si stende sui prati, 
Quando corre Nuvolari, quando passa Nuvolari, 
La gente aspetta il suo arrivo per ore e ore 
E finalmente quando sente il rumore 
Salta in piedi e lo saluta con la mano, 
Gli grida parole d'amore, 
E lo guarda scomparire 
Come guarda un soldato a cavallo, 
A cavallo nel cielo di Aprile! 
Nuvolari è bruno di colore, Nuvolari ha la maschera tagliente 
Nuvolari ha la bocca sempre chiusa, di morire non gli importa niente 
Corre se piove, corre dentro al sole 
Tre più tre per lui fa sempre sette 
Con l' ""alfa"" rossa fa quello che vuole 
Dentro al fuoco di cento saette! 
C'è sempre un numero in più nel destino quando corre Nuvolari 
Quando passa Nuvolari ognuno sente il suo cuore è vicino 
In gara Verona è davanti a Corvino 
Con un tempo d'inferno, 
Acqua, grandine e vento 
Pericolo di uscire di strada, 
Ad ogni giro un inferno 
Ma sbanda striscia è schiacciato 
Lo raccolgono quasi spacciato!

Batte Varzi, Campari,

Encourage the babies every time they say,
""Self-preservation is what's really going on today...""

Say I'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day,
But how can I turn loose when I just can't break away! (When I just can't break away!)

Oh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...
You and me...

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true;
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you...
Don't love you...

Oh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...

You - the hero
So many times
You've loved
And didn't linger
Now my finger
Points at you
- Another loser
You - an island
On your own
Complete
In every detail
Monumental
A precious jewel
Or just a fool
Innovator
It's in your mind
And blood
I watch it simmer
I see you're courting
More despair
No hope?
Not a glimmer
Now you're nothing
But second hand
In glove
With second rate now
Now you're flirting
With heroin
- Or is it cocaine?
Casanova -
Is that your name
Or do you live there?
I know my place
Is here with you
Tonight
But not together"

On your heart strings

Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat

Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me, how do you feel right after all?
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

Ooh, love 
Ooh, lover boy
What ya doin' tonight? Hey boy
Write me a letter, feel much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone

When I'm not with you
Think of you always I miss you
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
(Think of me always, love you, love you)
(Hey boy where did you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?)
I learned my passion
In the good old-fashioned school of lover boys

Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock)
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine
Come on and get it
Ooh, love
There it goes again
Ooh, lover boy
There he goes again just like a good old-fashioned lover boy

Ou será que a moça lá no alto
Não escuta o sobressalto
Do coração da gente

Que papai tá lá na roça
E mamãe foi passear
E todo marmanjo da cidade
Quer entrar
Nos versos da cantiga de ninar
Pra ser um Tutu-Marambá

Ai, como essa moça é distraída
Sabe lá se está vestida
Ou se dorme transparente
Ela sabe muito bem que quando adormece
Está roubando
O sono de outra gente

Ai, quanta maldade a dessa moça
E, que aqui ninguém nos ouça

As the damage they try to recover

Counting stars and flowers

In hopes that you still would be there

che non merita nemmeno l' attenzione della gente, quante cose più importanti hanno da fare,
se tu te la sei voluta, a loro non importa niente,
te l' avevan detto che finivi male...

ti sognava laureata, era fiero di sua figlia,
se solo immaginasse la vergogna,
se solo immaginasse la vergogna,
se solo immaginasse la vergogna...

E pensare a quel che ha fatto per la tua educazione, buone scuole e poca e giusta compagnia,
allevata nei valori di famiglia e religione, di ubbidienza, castità e di cortesia,
dimmi allora quel che hai fatto chi te l' ha mai messo in testa o dimmi dove e quando l'hai imparato
che non hai mai visto in casa una cosa men che onesta
e di certe cose non si è mai parlato

E tua madre, che da madre qualche cosa l' ha intuita e sa leggere da madre ogni tuo sguardo:
devi chiederle perdono, dire che ti sei pentita, che hai capito, che disprezzi quel tuo sbaglio.
Però come farai a dirle che nessuno ti ha costretta o dirle che provavi anche piacere,
questo non potrà capirlo, perchè lei, da donna onesta,
l' ha fatto quasi sempre per dovere,
l' ha fatto quasi sempre per dovere,
l' ha fatto quasi sempre per dovere...

E di lui non dire male, sei anche stata fortunata: in questi casi, sai, lo fanno in molti.
Sì, lo so, quando lo hai detto, come si usa, ti ha lasciata, ma ti ha trovato l' indirizzo e i soldi,
poi ha ragione, non potevi dimostrare che era suo e poi non sei neanche minorenne
ed allora questo sbaglio è stato proprio tutto tuo:
noi non siamo perseguibili per legge,
noi non siamo perseguibili per legge,
noi non siamo perseguibili per legge...

E così ti sei trovata come a un tavolo di marmo desiderando quasi di morire,
presa come un animale macellato stavi urlando, ma quasi l' urlo non sapeva uscire
e così ti sei trovata fra paure e fra rimorsi davvero sola fra le mani altrui,
che pensavi nel sentire nella carne tua quei morsi
di tuo padre, di tua madre e anche di lui,
di tuo padre, di tua madre e anche di lui,
di tuo padre, di tua madre e anche di lui?

Ma che piccola storia ignobile sei venuta a raccontarmi, non vedo proprio cosa posso fare.
Dirti qualche frase usata per provare a consolarti o dirti: ""è fatta ormai, non ci pensare"".
E' una cosa che non serve a una canzone di successo, non vale due colonne su un giornale,
se tu te la sei voluta cosa vuoi mai farci adesso
e i politici han ben altro a cui pensare
e i politici han ben altro a cui pensare

How many people watch you ridin' by
Like a thunder cloud that floats
Across the Arizona sky
And wonder if they're looking
At a mighty happy man
Or just a lonely breeze that drifts
Across the endless desert sand

Well it's gettin' kinda cold in Readosa
Abilene ain't gettin' any closer
One more drink, one more hand of poker
‘Cause a fool and his money's
Gonna have to part

You're too proud to ever show your sorrow
You don't steal and you won't beg or borrow
You may be here today but you're gone tomorrow
There ain't no strings on your boot heels
Or your heart

Wonder why you never promise
To come back some day
Maybe thinking you were holding
All the pieces in your hand
Or are they slippin' through your fingers

Just stand against the wall
Once I was just two feet high
Today I'm six feet tall

But knowing who to listen to
Is something else again
Words just whistle ‘round my head
Like seasons in the wind

All across the water the clouds are sailing
They won't let me look at the sky
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes

In searching for the way to go
I've followed all the rules
The way they say to chooses between
The wise men and the fools

I listen to the words they say
I read what I should read
I do whatever's right to do
Try to be what I should be

Someone let me in I think the sky is falling
Seems I've gotten lost on my way
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes

Ah, but wisdom isn't underground
Nor on a mountainside
And where am I to take myself
There's no place here to hide

All across the universe the stars are fading
Seems we've gotten lost on our way
All I want to do is try and find myself
Come and let me look in your eyes
Come and let me look in your eyes
Come and let me look in your eyes"

Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took the ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever gonna know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving diving diving diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky

I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky

Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky"

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, none can equal the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty

You can feel it surrounding us all.

men jag borde vetat att det
inte var lönt att tro att det skulle
vara för gott.
Nu blir jag skjuten igen

Och göra det i garderober

har skylten slocknat
som blinkade: Minns.
Och jag vill inget hellre
än få reda på
vem du är
och hur det skulle gå.

Jag vill ha ett Lejon

Att jag ska ha ett Lejon.
Det är dom enda jag kan lita på.

Jag satt i rummet helt aningslös
och strunta i musiken.
Och jag kände det
långt innan du kom

Den fula gula soppan
står där och glor.
Jag vet att jag kommer att
dricka av den
tills jag inte vet var jag bor.
Men tigern som vaknat
i djungelns natt
lockas snart hitåt
av fåglarnas skratt.
Och innan ens silvret
har hunnit ner

Beim Arabellahaus
Und wenn man da links abbiegt
Geht's nach Grosslappen naus
Dann rechtsherum durchs Siegestor
Vorbei an Hellabrunn
Da siegst a Schild nach Allach
Doch da kümmerst dich nicht drum!

Vorbei am Dom, in Richtung Riem
Des kommt dir komisch vor
Seit wann is Nordbad denn in Giesing
Links vom Isartor?
Doch dann, gleich hinterm Waldfriedhof
Da kommt ein Krankenhaus –
Das ist das rechts der Isar
Und da kennst dich wieder aus!

Ueber d'Donnersbergerbrückn
Und durchs Leuchtenbergtunnel
Dann die Abkürzung nach Solln naus
Denn die is besonders schnell!
Die Ludwigstraß nach Sendling
Rechts vorbei am Kronebau
Und des ois so nah bei Giesing –
Daraus werd ich gar nicht schlau!

Beim Haus der Kunst in Moosach drauss
Da stell ich plötzlich fest
Der Bahnhof München-Giesing
Geht ja durch bis Aubing-West!
Doch dann kommt schon der Friedensengel
Und es fällt mir ein
Von da weg bis nach Ramersdorf
Kanns nicht mehr recht weit sein!

Doch erst kommt noch der Harras
Milbertshofen und Hochbrück
Und ich hab leise den Verdacht
Mein Ziel liegt weit zurück!
Auf einmal ist es doch soweit
Wir sind in München-Ost
Vom MUH bis Ottobrunner Straß –
Fragn's nicht, was sowas kost!"
240,Joan Baez,Blowin' In The Wind,TRVJJDQ128F92FAE37,1976,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
How many years must some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
And how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many times can a man look up
Before he sees the sky?
How many ears must one person have
Before he can hear people cry?
And how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?

The answer, my friends, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Oh, the answer, my friends, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind"
241,Kansas,The Wall,TRGEHVW128F4266419,1976,"I'm woven in a fantasy, I can't believe the things I see
The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall
And with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost
It rises now before me, a dark and silent barrier between,
All I am, and all that I would ever want to be
It's just a travesty, towering, marking off the boundaries my spirit would erase

To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak
And those are few who've seen it through to glimpse the other side,
The promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride
The moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision's in the air
It's standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that's me
It's just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me
I want to see

Gold and diamonds cast a spell, it's not for me I know it well
The riches that I seek are waiting on the other side
There's more that I can measure in the treasure of the love that I can find
And though it's always been with me, I must tear down the Wall and let it be
All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony
Shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross
There is no loss"
242,Warren Zevon,Backs Turned Looking Down The Path,TRWARBG128F92EB8B7,1976,"I was caught between the years
Cost me nearly all my tears
With my back turned, looking down the path
Hit me like a ton of bricks
Had to get my outlook fixed
With my back turned, looking down the path

People always ask me why
What's the matter with me?
Nothing matters when I'm with my baby
With my back turned, looking down the path

We'll go walkin' hand in hand
Laughin' fit to beat the band
With our backs turned, looking down the path

People always ask me why
What's the matter with me?
Nothing matters when I'm with my baby
With my back turned, looking down the path

Some may have and some may not
God, I'm thankful for what I got
With my back turned, looking down the path
With my back turned, looking down the path
With my back turned, looking down the path"

Searching for a silver lining
Hoping that the clouds I'm climbing aren't hiding rain.

Nowhere left to go,
For every show now disappoints me.
Still the ghost of love lost haunts me till my dying day.

I could fly away,
Over the river of tears.
But I think I'll stay,
To face all my troubles and fight like a man.
I won't fear.
Love is near.

Crying to the sky
Weeping like a silver fountain,
Praying on the holy mountain that it won't rain.

I could say goodbye
Follow the Sun and the Moon
But that would be a lie.
My heart's in your hand
And I'm leading a band full of blues
Just for you

Crying to the sky
Searching for a silver lining
Hoping that the clouds I'm climbing aren't hiding rain."
251,The Alan Parsons Project,A Dream Within A Dream,TREZFLQ128F4263CA2,1976,"(spoken)

For my own part, I have never had a thought which I could not set down in words, with even more distinctness than that with which I conceived it.

There is, however, a class of fancies, of exquisite delicacy, which are not thoughts, and to which, as yet, I have found it absolutely impossible to adapt language.

These fancies arise in the soul (alas, how rarely!) only at its epochs of most intense tranquillity -- when the bodily and mental health are in perfection -- and at those mere points of time where the confines of the waking world blend with the world of dreams.

And so I captured this fancy, where all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream."

So do come, we beg you
Please interstellar policeman
Won't you give us a sign
Give us a sign that we've reached you

And transmit thought energy
Far beyond the norm
You close your eyes, you concentrate

To send the message

Surgeon general has determined that I may as well die.


Jesus are you watching or have you gone blind.
Evil souls are upon us and we're surely runnin' out of time.

I tried religion and some holy roller steals my tenth.
In the grave yard I ain't strong enough to jump the fence.
Some men they say they got more soul than both my shoes.
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.


I might be workin' on a scene that I can never act.
Everybody's gonna think that my mind is cracked.
I don't care because it's my right to win or lose.
Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues.


Crazy, am I crazy for wanting so much more.
