0,Cole Porter,I Hate Men,TRDMRSX12903CB5C80,1949,"I hate men.
I can't abide them even now and then.
Then ever marry one of them, I'd rest a maiden rather,
For husbands are a boring lot that only give you bother.
Of course, I'm awful glad that mother had to marry father,
Still, I hate men.

Of all the types of men I've met in our democracy,
I hate the most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy.
He may have hair upon his chesst, but sister, so has Lassie!
Oh, I hate men!

I hate men.
They should be kept like piggies in a pen.
You may be wooed by Jack the Tar, so charming and so chipper,
But if you're wooed by Jack the Tar, be sure that you're the skipper.
For Jack the Tar can go too far. Remember Jack the Ripper?
Oh, I hate men!

If thou shouldst wed a business man, be wary, oh be wary:
He'll tell you he's detained in town on business neccesary.
The business is the business that he gives his secretary!
Oh, I hate men!

I hate men.
Though roosters they, I will not play the hen.
If you espouse an older man through girlish optimism, 
He'll always stay at home and night and make no criticism.
Though you may call it love, the doctors call it rheumatism.
Oh, I hate men!

Of all I've read, alone in bed, from A to Zed about 'em,
Since love is blind, then from the mind, all womankind should rout 'em.
But, ladies, you must answer too, what would we do without 'em?
Still, I HATE men!"
1,Cole Porter,So In Love,TRDWCCX12903CB5C7A,1949,"Strange dear, but true dear,
When I'm close to you, dear,
The stars fill the sky,
So in love with you am I.
Even without you,
My arms fold about you,
You know darling why,
So in love with you am I.
In love with the night mysterious,
The night when you first were there,
In love with my joy delirious,
When I knew that you could care,
So taunt me, and hurt me,
Deceive me, desert me,
I'm yours, till I die.....
So in love.... So in love....
So in love with you, my love... am I...."
2,Ernest Tubb,Warm Red Wine,TRAZIPR128F42A7AB5,1949,"Put a nickel in the jukebox and let it play for my heart is so cold with pain
Take the cork from the bottle of the warm red wine and fill my glass up again
Fill my glass to the brim till it flows o'er the rim
Like the tears flow in this heart of mine
And I'll say so long to the dreams that are gone on account of the warm red wine
A prison of stone with its cold iron bars is no more a prison than mine
I'm a prisoner of drink and can never escape from the chains of the warm red wine
Fill my glass to the brim..."
3,Fats Domino,Detroit City Blues,TRCEFME128F930E5AA,1949,"Detroit City
It was the finest city it was
Yes Detroit City
It was the finest city it was
I'm crazy 'bout that city
And I love its pretty girls
When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
When you leave that city
And you feel this kind of love
Just one goes out easy
And you find a good place to go

You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
You don't need a lot of money
To have a real good time
Just be a real good boy
And everything will turn out fine"
4,Fats Domino,The Fat Man,TRTNDTF128F1459664,1949,"They call, they call me the fat man
'Cause I weight two hundred pounds
All the girls they love me
'Cause I know my way around

I was standin', I was standin' on the corner
Of Rampart and Canal
I was watchin', watchin'
Watchin' all these creole gals

Wah wah wah, wah wah
Wah wah waah, wah wah wah
Wah wah waah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah

Wah waaa-ah wah
Wah wah wah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah

I'm goin', I'm goin' goin' away
And I'm goin', goin' to stay
'Cause women and a bad life
They're carrying this soul away."
5,Frank Sinatra,Fools Rush In,TRWLSEV128F424894F,1949,"Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see
The danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in"
6,Frank Sinatra,Laura,TRDWSIL12903CA89FA,1949,"Writer(s): David Raksin - Johnny Mercer 


Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The LAUGH that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura
But she's only a dream"
7,Frank Sinatra,One for My Baby (And One More for the Road),TRYGSQP12903CFD2F2,1949,"It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place except you and me
So, set 'em up, Joe, I got a little story you oughta know
We're drinkin', my friend, to the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I got the routine, so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feelin' so bad, wish you'd make the music pretty and sad
Could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code
So, make it one for my baby and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy, you simply gotta listen to me
Till it's all talked away

Well that's how it goes and Joe, I know your gettin' pretty anxious to close
So, thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear
This torch that I found must be drowned or it soon might explode
So, make it one for my baby and one more for the road
That long, long road"
8,Gene Autry,Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,TRGSCSR128F9313B67,1949,"You know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history""

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight""

Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history"
9,Hank Snow,I Wonder Where You Are Tonight,TRTHSVF128F4278100,1949,"Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
Although you've gone and found another I wonder where you are tonight

That old rain is cold and slowly falling upon my window pane tonight
And though your love was even colder I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me though you said you often cared
And now you've gone and found another someone to know the love I've shared
That old rain is cold...
[ fiddle - steel ]
Then came the dawn the day you left me I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me that lingers in my heart tonight
That old rain is cold..."
10,Hank Snow,Nobody's Child,TRJQSDY128F92F212A,1949,"I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
And stopped there for a moment, just to watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry

I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child
I'm like a flower just growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child

People come for children and take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me by and I am left alone
I know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm blind
They always take some other child and I am left behind

No mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish that I could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids there'd be a home for me

I just can't seem to figure out why the folks all pass me by
Cause I know that it's true that God takes little blind children with him in the sky
And they tell me that I'm oh so pretty and they seem to like my big curls of gold
But then they take some other little child and I'm left here all alone

I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child
I'm like a flower just growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child"
11,Hank Thompson,Soft Lips,TRMJBRG128F42A7916,1949,"Soft lips that feel so divine soft lips pressed close to mine
The thrill of your kiss is heavenly blessed
Your tender caress I could never express
Soft lips I love you so soft lips don't ever go
My heart would break don't you see if you ever took from me
The thrill of your soft lips
[ steel - fiddle ]
Soft lips I love you so..."
12,Hank Thompson,I Find You Cheatin' On Me,TRWGFRI128F92E1271,1949,"I find you cheatin' on me like you have done before
There ain't no greetin' for me when I walk through the door
I find you cheatin' on me but then I'm not surprised
All the things you told me were little white lies

A secret love you're hiding behind the heart that beats for him
While you're kind with me you're fighting you got me way out on a limb
I find you cheatin' on me but this is the end
We'll be lovers no more we'll just be friends
[ steel - fiddle ]
I find you cheatin' on me but then it's nothing new
Your heart ain't beatin' for me countless times I've been blue
I find you cheatin' on me just when my back is turned
That little flame of love for me don't burn

The love now you have twisted and choked my heart with pain
My love is unassisted because you cheated once again
I find you cheatin' on me but this is the end
We'll be lovers no more we'll just be friends"
13,Hank Williams,Lost Highway,TRGZEZU128F1459DF9,1949,"I'm a rollin' stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
Oh the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I take a cost on the lost highway

Now boys, don't start to ramblin' around
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway"
14,Hank Williams,Mind Your Own Business,TREOXHK12903CCC74F,1949,"If the wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.

Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.

I got a little gal that wears her hair up high, 
The boys all whistle when she walks by.
Why don't you mind your own business 
(Mind your own business)
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine.

If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.
Just mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine. 

Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why don't you mind your own business
(Mind your own business)
If you mind your own business, you'll stay busy all the time."
15,Harry Belafonte,Close Your Eyes,TRMISIF128F9326A34,1949,"Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes
And I will close mine
Close your eyes
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep
Close your eyes
Oh this is divine
Music play something dreamy for dancing
While we're here romancing it's love's holiday
And love will be our guide
Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near by your side
So won't you close your eyes"
16,Harry Belafonte,Lean on me,TRBTMIA12903D0D9B5,1949,"Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
But if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.
Lean on me, when you're not strong and I'll be your friend.
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody
To lean on.
Please swallow your pride, if have things you need to borrow.
For no one can fill those needs that you won't let show.

You just call on me brother when you need a hand.
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand.
We all need somebody to lean on.

Lean on me when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend.
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna' need
Somebody to lean on.

You just call on me brother if you need a friend.
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand.
We all need somebody to lean on.

If there is a load you have to bear that you can't carry.
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load if you just call me.

Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me"
17,Leon Payne,I Love You Because,TRWWXAK12903CBD352,1949,"I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I tried to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you

No matter what the world may say, about you
I know your love will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide

No matter what
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you"
18,Lightnin' Hopkins,Morning Blues,TRNBIUT128F4247E67,1949,"You know I went down to my baby's house, fell down on my knees,
crying please, please help poor me, help old me
She said, ""Lightnin' I wished I was rich and you were poor""
The meals that you've been getting, I will see that you never get them no more
She's talking to me and I'm down on bended knee
Somebody help me, help me, please
You know I went to my house, wasn't nobody there but me
That was trouble, that was worry, Lord, Lord, like the whole world would see
Somebody please help me, I've been wondering about my fate
Her little smiling, baby, I can't see
Well I'm about to make it up in my mind to let her go ahead on
Baby, you go have a good time, while I walk my floor and moan
You may not miss me now, but you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well I just can't do nothing but cry, I just got to walk my floor and moan"
19,T-Bone Walker,T-Bone Shuffle,TRBTSNF12903C9572C,1949,"Let your hair down baby 'n' let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby, 'n' let's have a natural ball
'Cause when you're not happy, it ain't no fun at all

You can't take it with you, that's one thing for sure
You can't take it with you baby, that's one thing for sure
There's nothing wrong with you baby, that a good T-Bone shuffle can't cure

Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing
Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing
You can't tell what might happen, that's why I love to sing"
