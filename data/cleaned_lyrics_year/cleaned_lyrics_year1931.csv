0,Bessie Smith,Safety Mama,TRISTAT12903CFCBA1,1931,"Let me tell you how and why what no-good man done to me
He called me pretty, young and wild, after that he let me be
He'd taken advantage of my mouth, and that you understand
So, wait a while, show you, chile, just how to treat a no-good man
Make him stay at home, wash and iron,
Tell all the neighbors he done lost his mind
Give your house rent shake
On Saturday night
Monday morning you'll hold collectors good and tight
You see a man you really like
Let him bite that monkey, brother, in his back
When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down
Hold him where you got him make him stay in town,
'cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man
Make him stay at home, help me wash and iron,
The neighbors know he done lost his mind
I give a house rent shake on Saturday night
Monday morning I held collectors good and tight
I seen a man I really like
I let him bite that monkey, brother, smack in his back
When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down
I hold it where I had it and he stayed in town,
I'm a safety woman, and I had to have a safety man
I ain't good lookin', I'm built for speed
I've got ev'rything a pigmeat needs
'Cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man"
1,Charley Patton,Dry Well Blues,TRMQIVO128F422A92B,1931,"Way down in Lula, hard livin' has done hit
Way down in Lula, hard livin' has done hit
Lord, your drought come an' caught us

An' parched up all the tree
Aw, she stays over in Lula, bid that ol' town goodbye
Stays in Lula, bidding you the town goodbye

Fore I would come to know the day
Oh, the Lula well was gone dry

Lord, there're citizens around Lula
Aw, was doin' very well
Ctizens around Lula, aw, was doin' very well

Now they're in hard luck together
'Cause rain don't pour nowhere

I ain't got no money and I sure ain't got no hope
I ain't got no money and I sure ain't got no hope
...come in, furnished all the cotton and crops

Boy, they tell me the country, Lord, it'll make you cry
Lord, country, Lord, it'll make you cry
Most anybody, Lord, hasn't any water in the bayou
Lord, the Lula womens, Lord, puttin' Lula young mens down

Lula men, oh, puttin' Lula men down
Lord, you outta been there, Lord
The womens all leavin' town"
2,Skip James,Special Rider Blues,TRMFMAE128F4261D15,1931,"I ain't got no, special rider here
I ain't got no, no special rider here
I ain't got nobody
To love and feel my care

I woke up this mo'nin
Looked at spec-special risin' sun
I woke up this mo'nin
I looked at special risin' sun
Now, I pray up to the good Lord
That my special rider, she would come

I got up off-a my pallet

I laid down 'cross my bed
I got up off my pallet
An I laid down across my bed
When I went to eat my break'qast
An the blues was all in my bread

You know, I got a letter
How do you reck'in it read?
I got a letter
An how do you reck'in it read?
You better hur' up an come home
Because yo' special rider, she's dead

That's the reason I ain't
Got no special rider
Rider, here
That's the reason I ain't
Got no special rider, here
Now, I ain't got nobody
To love and feel my care"
3,Skip James,Cypress Grove Blues,TRMXUVK128F930CE32,1931,"I would rather be buried in some cypress grove
I would rather be buried in some cypress grove
To have some woman, Lord, that I can't control

And I'm goin' away now, I'm goin' away to stay
And I'm goin' away now, I'm goin' away to stay
That'll be all right, pretty mama, you gonna need my help someday

And the sun goin' down, and you know what your promise means
And the sun goin' down, you know what your promise means
And what's the matter, baby, I can't see

I would rather be dead and six feet in my grave
I would rather be dead and six feet in my grave
Than to be way up here, honey, treated this a-way

And the old people told me, baby, but I never did know
The old people told me, baby woman, but I never did know
""The good book declare you got to reap just what you sow""

When your knee bone's achin' and your body cold
When your knee bone's achin' and your body cold
Means you just gettin' ready, honey, for the cypress grove"
4,Skip James,I'M So Glad,TRWDEOJ128F93454CC,1931,"And I'm so glad, and I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad
I don't know what to do, don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I'm tired of weepin', tired of moanin', tired of groanin' for you

And I'm so glad, I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad
I'm tired of weepin', tired of moanin', tired of groanin' for you
And I'm so glad, and I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad

I'm so tired of moanin', tired of groanin', tired of longin' for you
I'm so glad, and I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad
I don't know what to do, know what to do, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, and I am tired, I am tired...

And I'm so glad, I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad
I don't know what to do, know what to do, I don't know what to do
I'm tired of weepin', tired of moanin', tired of groanin' for you
And I'm so glad, and I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad

I'm so tired, and I am tired, I am tired, I'm tired
I'm tired of weepin', tired of moanin', tired of groanin' for you
I'm so glad, and I am glad, I am glad, I'm glad
I don't know what to do, know what to do, don't know what to do"
5,Skip James,Devil Got My Woman,TRCYBTD12903CF37BD,1931,"I'd rather be the devil, to be that woman man
I'd rather be the devil, to be that woman man

Aw, nothin' but the devil, changed my baby's mind
Was nothin' but the devil, changed my baby's mind

I laid down last night, laid down last night
I laid down last night, tried to take my rest

My mind got to ramblin', like a wild geese
From the west, from the west

The woman I love, woman that I loved
Woman I loved, took her from my best friend

But he got lucky, stoled her back again
But he got lucky, stoled her back again"
6,Tampa Red,Bumble Bee Blues,TRWWSRH128F4280585,1931,"Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
He got the best old stinger
Any bumble bee that I ever seen

He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
Lord, it got me to the place
Hate to see my bumble bee leave home

Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I can't stand to hear him
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Come in, bumble bee
Want you to stop your fuss
You're my bumble bee
And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough

Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I don't mind you going
Ain't going to stay so long
Don't mind you going
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

I can't stand to hear him
Buzz, buzz, buzz
Come in, bumble bee
I want you to stop your fuss
You's my bumble bee
And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough
