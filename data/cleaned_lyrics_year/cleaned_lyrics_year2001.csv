I got a tattoo on my arm with your name
A Ragin' virus burnin' through my skin
Can you tell me why this has to end?

I didn't mean to hurt anyone
I didn't mean to she'd no, she'd no blood yeah

Baby you will set me free

It's I who live here now
I don't know how I got here
There's this man who comes every night

And hour passes
Then i another
Smoking slowly

Her death
Was she already dead
When i came ?
I mean enought to bury

I am in her room
It's I who live here now
I don't know how I got here
There's this man who comes every night

I count my cigarettes"

Don't mess with Bill

I loved him more than before

3,Feeder,We Can't Rewind,TRVHYYN128F14520BD,2001,"You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in a cloud
You're trying to find your way in
To let your soul shine back out
We're just a twist in a seam
A splash of paint on a screen
We're making all kinds of shapes
Somehow we can straighten out the bends

This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out
And we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
Our place to shine now
And we can do it anyway - we can't rewind

Do you think we can change
A different colour and shade
I guess a new kind of thing
Somehow we can straighten out the bends

This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out
And we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
Our place to shine now
And we can do it anyway
Oh yes we can do it our way then

Stop taking me for a fool now
I've got this feeling inside me
But I guess you knew
We can work it out
We can find some place new
We can't rewind, we can't rewind

Your just a face in a crowd
A tiny hole in a cloud
This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out
And we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
A place to shine now
And we can do it anyway

This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out
And we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
A place to shine now
And we can do it anyway"

With your hair piled up high, I will never forget
I'm drunk right now, baby, but I've got to be
Or I never could tell you what you mean to me

I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie

You're the song that the trees sing when the wind blows
You're a flower, you're a river, you're a rainbow
Sometimes I'm crazy but I guess you know
And I'm weak and I'm lazy and I've hurt you so

And I don't listen to a word you say
When you're in trouble I turn away

I love you, I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you, Marie"

Tu verrais comme il a grandi
Il ne marche plus à quatre pattes
Tu verrais comme il me sourit
Tu ne crois donc pas que tu te déboîtes
T'as perdu le nord égaré le midi
Tu sais aujourd'hui ce qui me frappe
C'est que je te plains mon pauvre ami
T'as tellement peur que ça soit bien
T'as tellement peur que ça s'arrête
T'as tellement peur de croire au bien
T'as tellement peur de la défaite
Regarde un peu comme le temps se gâte
Quand je t'ai connu t'étais plein de vie
Et regarde-moi comme tu te détraques
Si tu voyais comme il a grandi
Toi, du moment que l'on se tache
C'est que l'on est encore en vie
Alors tu t'éloignes tu te détaches
Ton seul bonheur c'était ici
T'as tellement peur que ça soit bien
T'as tellement peur que ça s'arrête
Que tu te contentes de trois fois rien
T'es vraiment pas doué pour la fête"
7,Dolly Parton,Will He Be Waiting,TRRIDZJ128F92FC07B,2001,"I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me 
The road that led me out of his life 
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder 
The day that I told him good-bye 

I never should'a left him 
Never should'a gone 
Oh what a crazy fool I've been 

Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
And will he take me back again 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

Shadows from the trees 
Shade the path that I am walkin' 
As I make my way back up that windy road again 
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume 
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end 

I wonder if he missed me 
Wonder if he wants me 
I wonder does he love me still 

Will he be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Oh how I hope he will 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died 
He will be waiting for me 
He will be, won't he 
Or will I find that this time 
I'll be the one to cry 

Cry, mmmm"
8,Melanie Thornton,No Tears,TRVTPYT128F4250649,2001,"Music by Melanie Thornton and Todd Chisolm
Lyrics by Melanie Thornton 

Verse 1
So long I've waited, patiently
Did what I was told was best for me
Blindly I'd follow, trustingly
And never question why
Unaware of the power inside of me
It was a gift of love that was meant to be
Something shared with the world, faithfully
It was my only dream

Chorus 
No tears to cry, no sad good-byes
I'm spreading my wings and I'm ready to fly
No tears to shed, only happiness ahead
This millennium will be my time to be free

Verse 2
Through it all I have grown, no regrets
I can say I've learned my lesson well
The struggle and pain I won't forget
It's made a mark on me
But with all of the strength I possess
I've gotta go for the chance of a life so sweet
No doubt in my mind, I am blessed
I'm gonna live my dream

Chorus

Breakdown
No, no, no tears...
Oooh I wanted it so bad I could cry
No, no, no tears
But when I got it, it wasn't right
No, no, no tears
It was somebody else's vision of me
No, no, no tears
And now I'm gonna live mine

Chorus"
9,Phantom Ghost,Electronic Alcatraz,TRQTKWG128F422B513,2001,"the rattle in my brain
drove me off the dancefloor
the tune stayed in my head
as they led me to the door
and the sky was mighty big
but I could still hear them talking
a muffled hum vaguely resembling
the voice of stephen hawking

the gossip of the famous
the blessed and the respected
the skin that was shown appeared to be known
its weakness is detected
I can't quite recall the joke you made then
I remember its punch line well
I might assume that this is art
but who needs wallpapers in hell?

look at the crowd
the dancefloor never was a prison cell
I'll stay here
you can calculate what I might sell
if you must
you might say in the morning we`ll be dust
but for now
to every thought there is a tune in alcatraz

I had considered all the options
consulted all the experts
when I stopped by your apartment
to see if the light was on
and like in the movies when the monster´s behind you
my ears could trace a roar
I heard my track rolling up your stairs
scratching at your door
and when the whole street got silent
I heard it ring your bell
something waited to deliver
some long papers from hell

to every thought there is a tune for you in alcatraz (2x)

if you must
you might say in the morning we´ll be dust
but for now

to every thought there is a tune in alcatraz (3x)

if you must
you might say in the morning we´ll be dust"
10,Gibonni,MIRAKUL,TRPROBI12903CC9D78,2001,"Divno je kad žena ima petlju
Da te uzme k sebi
Onda kad si slab

Divno je kad æutiš snagu njenu
Koja vadi me iz moga blata van
Divno je...

Divno je kad izlaziš na svjetlo
Dok priviknu se oči
Znam da nisam sam

Divno je i ne dogaða se često
Taman toliko da sam o njoj ovisan
Divno je...

Je te donne ma liberte
A to ne sliči na mene


Jer sve je moje njeno
Kao zapleteno
Prokleto i sveto za mene

Something in my bones
Something under skin
Something in her words
It's miracle for me
It's a miracle


Je te donne ma liberte

She makes me a better man

Odakle joj pravo
Znati me ovako
I ući mi pod kožu zauvijek?
Odakle joj pravo?


Something in my bones
Something under skin
Something in her words
It's miracle for me
It's a miracle
She makes me a better man."

(Krayzie - repeat 4x)
I'ts Krayzie Bone (Krayzie, Krayzie, Krayzie)

(Chorus)
Homie, y'all don't know me (know me)
Mighta heard my name (my name)
Ain't nobody feelin hold me ( hold me)
Not in this game (not in this game)
Homie, y'all don't know me (know me)
Mighta heard my name (my name)
But ain't nobody goin to hold me(hold me)
Especially in this game

(Verse 1: Krayzie)
Excuse me, but do you know me?
You've seen me on TV and in the video
Got caught up in Crossroads forgot that we was criminals
That's right, we them same niggaz to come up from nothin
To what up with them figures?
Nigga, my album got better thangs
And people changed when I got in the game
Niggaz call me I don't even know how you know my name?
How the fuck you get my number?
What the fuck is going on?
Then I got these haters leavin threats on my phone
They messages be records that they made just for me
I'm not on that don't give a fuck if you rap faster than me
But when it come to being the realest niggaz that ever did it
You know Bone Thugs gonna be contendin for that position
Listen, if y'all niggaz wanna trip with us, bomb ya fall witcha dick in the
dust
Get up, what up? Thought ya had me figured out you didn't
Remember next time, that last time that nigga wasn't bullshittin

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Krayzie)
Homie, y'all don't know me
Y'all mighta heard my name once or twice
Don't start none (drama), won't be none (drama)
Cause however they want it, they can come get it believe I got it
Can't be faded keep thinkin Krayzie ain't really crazy
Haters, that pressin me to make me show this lately
Afraid that they mistaken that they thinkin Kray ain't hip, hip, hip
To those who pose as friends
But are phony before they can infiltrate but can't immitate us for long
They better not come talkin no shit cause I'm servin 'em some
And fuck whatcha heard, believe whatcha see please
Dap is cheap, dramatical action speaks
Did you hear it, hear it?
I know ya feel it, feel it the twelve gauge eruption

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Krayzie)
We got a game full of clones that can't hold they own
So they be fast to bite
Nigga don't like Bone, then why the fuck you rappin like me bastard
You know you like it, nigga'z funny
Be bobbin they head to my music, but when they see me they mean muggin
Keep lookin ugly, niggaz but jut don't jump
Cause I'm a nervous nigga, and I'll buck, buck, buck
Thug haters they get me violent
Cops make me riot
You bitches make me sick and tired, sin keeps me wide up
And I needs to be high, just for fuckin with y'all
And I dedicate this one to all them bustas I knew would fall
Had to get rid of the dead weight that was holdin me down (holdin me down)
The Thugline officials and it's goin down (down)
So wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dawg
No need, don't even try to fade us, y'all
Who the nigga in the halls, big balls?
That's Sawed Off Slim
Don't try to get with him cause playa, playa

12,Monster Movie,Ooby,TRFNGJL128F9331084,2001,"I saw the earth beneath me
I took a flight cause I know they're out there
Did you know the mornin'

Oh well I know what we're thinking
Moving too fast, get a glimpse of it all
And maybe it's you that is moving in circles
But I sure hope that this thing is built to last"
13,Immortal Technique,Speak Your Mind,TRSVQHK128F4299980,2001,"(Intro)
You have to speak the truth
You have to speak your mind

(Verse 1)
Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical
The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
Beyond anything ever studied that's metaphysical
Man fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal
But obviously terminologies that are statistical
Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
Habitually utilizing typical rituals
With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
TO individuals who believe in biblical miracles
Instead of themselves, because they're not thinking original
And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
Like microscopic miscarriages lynched wit the umbilical
Only a fuckin imbecile would think their uncorrectable
Cause your susceptible to becoming more than a spectacle
Remember that your flesh your blood and you body are dissectable
Ill beat you until your vegetable
And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals
In a fetal position wit your face sewn to your testicles
Thinking that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles
Technique, I'm like ya soul nigga.. indispensable
Wit no respect for those that cower at the hour of revolution
Cause the government owes my people restitution
Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me
Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
In school my teachers blinded me
But now I can see
I'm mentally and revolutionarily free
Broadening Horizons about what my people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot locked or OD
You see families bleed because of corporate greed
And monopolizing weed is virtually impossible
So it wont be legalized and thats another obstacle
But I'm still rollin up pocket fulls of tropical
The governments involved directly so its unstoppable
Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins that invade the ecological
Improbable that the average intellect could understand
So I encrypted this into hip hop thats in high demand
and spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
Cause I'm tryin to save the earth, but your just next in line to rape her"
14,Maija Vilkkumaa,Suomen neito,TRUVRPI128E0786873,2001,"Mä olin nuori silloin, vielä Dianakin eli
kun Marjo mut kisoihin houkutteli

ja jos hyvin sattui niin limousiini kotiin vei

Ja niin kimmelsi yössä
kruunut ja kyyneleet
ja kun on juhlissa työssä
joka hetki kuljettaa väistämättä kohti sitä aamua

Kun lehdet täynnä on mua
tässä hän taas jua!
ja hän ennen oli kaunis ja hyvä
jee, tässä hän suutelee
kameraa pakoilee
ja hän ennen oli kaunis ja hyvä
ja niin päätäni särkee taas
päätäni särkee taas
päätäni särkee taas

Nyt monet sanoo et muss on enää sievää vain kuoret
ne ei tajuu et juhlii ne muutkin nuoret
ja toisin kuin moni mä en ole mikään pummi
mä oon työteliäs, tyylikäs ja klinikan kummi mä oon

Tää maa on kylmä ja harmaa

vain yksi täällä on varmaa

Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real

Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind
Got me wanna boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance

Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me
Girl cuz I'ma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be

Envejecido, por la humedad, la oscuridad

¿Qué más da? La cárcel
Es profunda y de piedra
No hay buenos días para mi

Nadie me conoce bien, nadie sabe
Cuales son mis sueños
Todas las noches, recuerdo tu
Cuerpo tirado bajo el sol

Te lo juro, nunca lo
Quise hacer, estoy desesperado
Estoy arrepentido
Daría cualquier cosa, por poder volverte a ver

Solo hay luz, cuando no hay oscuridad,
No sé cuanto tiempo pasará, solo puedo
Esperar, a que entre un poco de luz,
Para ver la divina imagen, la que me dejó
Mi dios en la pared

La que me dejó, mi dios en la pared"

For the tears and the pain

I don't know what I can say

All my life has lead to this decision
To return and ask You this one thing

Remember all of those nights when you told me you had to work late?
Think back to the times you stood me up and the countless broken dates
I got tired of the aggravation so I made a reservation
A special evening I planned just for you

Party of one at a table for two
waitin' on me like I waited on you
I can just see you now 
I can picture your face
Checkin' your watch 
Fellin' so out of place 
Now you're gonna find out how it feels
to be lonesome and blue
Bein' a party of one at a table for two

Hey babe
By now you must be wonderin' what the heck is takin' so long
You think I'm probablystuck in traffic
But boy you couldn't be more wrong
I call and tell you that I'll be later 
I left a message with your waiter
Says I hope you enjoy your night alone, bein'......

Tonight maybe messin' with your mind
Might teach you a lesson this time
Surely you're smart enough to know
That you always reap what you sow

Well, I am an intensive out-patient
Without scripts without pills
November was so cold coming down

And I, well I'm all alone
Watching the snow fall on the pines
And the smell, the smell of the stoves
Burning wood makes me miss better times

And I'm reading The Overcoat again
And I feel just like a clerk
Maybe better but more likely it's worse
Nothing seems to work.

Semi's from the mill
Are rolling by with freshly cut pine
They don't stop for black ice
Leaving the lights in this mill town behind

And it's New Years Eve
And there's nothing to do and there's no where to go
So i get a pass from my counsellor
To go walk in the snow

Maybe I'm going in circles again
But it's hard to say
Cause my tracks keep on filling up with snow 
And they fade away"

A curtain moves behind a window
You're now completely out of range

Standing on the edge, casting lots to set me up
Before you knock me down
Off the summer's edge and drown me
We're betting on our own lives
Making up for all the time we lost

In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades
(One breath, one step, could knock it all down)
But you lead with your eyes and you give it away
(Decide, Design, to cut from the clouds)
When the people you love get lost in the shuffle
(When you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts)
You let it go and then you fold

So we stay on the open road
We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all
Driving in your car
Miss the stop sign fall in love
Just to get knocked down
Off the summer's edge and drown me
We're betting on our own lives 
Making up for all the time we lost

In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades

But you lead with your eyes and you give it away

The Godman Christ cause cursed man to the test.
And this Goddamned cross crushed into my chest I'm still doing my best.

And so the winter time comes calling.
Through the skies I'm crawling, from cloud nine, I've fallen.
And then the foolish times rush in.
It's no longer mine, life on cloud nine.

Place your dreams in a bottle, smash it to the ground, slip off you slippers and dance all around.
It's blood baby, it's just blood baby, it's just blood baby, it's just your precious blood.

I've come this far and I said I'd go all the way but these fevered winds sway stronger each day.
Yeah I'm fool's gold, and my heart's not right but I'd still sell what's left in my soul just to pay the tithe.

You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why, 'cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

You crave for the needle to stick in your vein
Can't wait for the poison to kill all the pain
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride
That beautiful flower is eating your mind

You try so hard to quit, but you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why, 'cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

Your name means nothing, you don't know the score
Body is aching, you still crave for more
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns

You're chasing the dragon, you're chasing the high
A bird with one wing who's still trying to fly
You're all out of spirit, a dead man alive
A born again junkie, you'll never survive

You try so hard to quit, but you'll never admit
You're the junkie
There's no reasoning why, 'cause the mirror don't lie
You're the junkie

Junkie
Junkie
Junkie
Junkie"

Reach and grasp beneath my skin.

See my fate.
Wreck a lifetime.
Gain my heart.
Kill my visions.

In those days I denied you for every second.
And now I can't accomplish anything.
Still got so much more to give in this life.
I guess I'm heading for regrets.

Once I sold my soul.
That's one sweet regret."

 of the first verse)

You know God damn well I don't smoke this shit Meth
*coughing* Know damn well I don't smoke this sheyit
Know damn well!
I remember when we used to go down to the creek
Member when we used to go down to the creek?
And used to dip your head in the water?
Everybody thought you had it in you, you know
You used to jump out the water

C'mon baby baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, c'mon!

Verse One:

Superlogical this, superlogical that
I detect a nigga dialect by the way he rap
I elect myself President MC

Verse Two: Method Man, Ol Dirty Bastard

Crazy, lurkin in the shadows, I'm shady, sheisty
Get your weight up, don't take me lightly
Blasted, dirty to the grain I be stained with the madness
It's the Meth-Tical with the Bastard

Verse Three: Method Man

This one here's for my people, my people
Enter the 36 chambers, the sequel
Part two, for me and the cipher troop
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what?
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin
Straight from the beginning, of the game
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger

Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard

The hardware, choose the hardware
Ask you a question, test the Ason
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one
which you intrigue, do your rap fatigue in the...

They say that love is blind
But I think that dumb is what they had in mind
I could let it go, but I'd rather know
If I sit around, will another show

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
I could lay in bed, like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
If I may say myself
I'm not bad at life, I'm not good as well
And though life goes on, I can't plainly see
Just what is it for, if its not for me ?

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Oh...babe...

I'm going nowhere, nowhere is where I wanna be
And then I'm good for nothing
Nothing is good enough for me

Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Oh, please..

I'm good for nothing.
Nothing is good enough for me.
Anything, anything can come to anybody
Everything, everything can come to someone, sometime

Sometime
Opportunity passes right by me didn't even slow,
I can't breathe and think and I need a drink,
All this common sense made a fool of me.

Sometime
I like to sit around

I can lay in bed like my momma said
Don't just do something, sit around instead

Sometime
I get to fly so high
That the sun burns my wings, but I will fly
Just a little too far, cause thats where you are
And I won't bring you down, believe in me

Sometime
I get me all confused, and the resons why are confusing too
I could be with you, try to sort it out
If I tell the truth, I like to lie about

Sometime
Though its a big surprise
I made compromise the thing I most desire
I can say with pride, hold my head up high
That I had a great idea but nevermind.

Sometime
I like to sit around
and just contemplating sitting round
Although life goes on, I can't plainly see
All this common sense made a fool of me

I don't want to live but I can't resist

I've got some reasons and I made list

I'm gonna drown before my ship comes in

And I forgot to ring my mum again

se desnuda en el alba,
se dibuja en el sueão,
se refugia en el alma.
Se prolonga en el tiempo,
y en el tiempo se acaba,
nadie puede tenerla
aunque puedan comprarla. La belleza es tan breve,
la belleza es tan casta
que hay que andar con cuidado
para no deshojarla.
Es tan pura y tan dulce

Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
Cuz I had to say goodbye

By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

How can I adjust
To the way that things are going
It's killing me slowly
Oh I just want it to be how it used to be

Cuz I wish that I could stay
But in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why oh

By now I should know that
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad

if it couldn't be that bad
tell me why?

We tryna win girl
In order to win, there's gotta be a leader
And that's me, but I don't mind sharing the light with you

If you leave, I don't even trip
That's the way I kick it oh
All my folks say I'm stupid for that
They just jealous of you cause I don't need a ride like that
One thing I always said if I find a girl I'll treat her right
I'm saying I think that's you tonight

Your long gone face had been replaced
with better thoughts now runnin' through my mind
when you left you cut my heart in half
just took some time but now I'm makin my way back

CHORUS:
I feel more like me(She compromised and justafied No matter what the cost)
I've let go of your memory(Inch by inch became a mile until she just got lost)
NOw the hands of time have been so kind
And finally set me free(free, free)
I feel more like me

Ther was a time when I was strong
Wild and free runnin' with the wind
And now the chains are finally gone
And I know I'll be that way again
You took my soul and tore it clean in two
But ever since I saw that open door and walked right through

CHORUS

I compromised and justafied 
No matter what the cost
Inch by inch became a mile until I just got lost
But there's no more cryin'
'Cause I'm flyin' and today's a brand new day
Just look at me go now
And I think it's safe to say that

Four little black girls killed for no goddamn good reason
All this hate and violence can't come to no good end
A stain on the good name.
A whole lot of good people dragged through the blood and glass
Blood stains on their good names and all of us take the blame

Meanwhile in North Alabama, Wilson Pickett comes to town
To record that sweet soul music, to get that Muscle Shoals sound

Meanwhile in North Alabama, Aretha Franklin comes to town
To record that sweet soul music, to get that Muscle Shoals sound

And out in California, a rock star from Canada writes a couple of great songs about the
Bad shit that went down
""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"" certainly told some truth
But there were a lot of good folks down here and Neil Young wasn't around

Meanwhile in North Alabama, Lynyrd Skynyrd came to town
To record with Jimmy Johnson at Muscle Shoals Sound
And they met some real good people, not racist pieces of shit
And they wrote a song about it and that song became a hit

Ronnie and Neil Ronnie and Neil
Rock stars today ain't half as real
Speaking their minds on how they feel
Let them guitars blast for Ronnie and Neil

Now Ronnie and Neil became good friends their feud was just in song
Skynyrd was a bunch of Neil Young fans and Neil he loved that song
So He wrote ""Powderfinger"" for Skynyrd to record
But Ronnie ended up singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" to the lord

And Neil helped carry Ronnie in his casket to the ground
And to my way of thinking, us southern men need both of them around

Ronnie and Neil Ronnie and Neil
Rock stars today ain't half as real
Speaking their minds on how they feel
Let them guitars blast for Ronnie and Neil"

Welcoming my gods, an equal I am
A travel awaits before me
Encircled as a God, dead as a man
An era has now ended
But a new era will come
While my destiny fulfits itself
I glance at the world with wisdom from the end
My efforts will now be rewarded
As I enter Kingdom Come
My hate will now get fatal for those that disapproved me once
With my misanthropic these soon brought to life
I'll see an definite end for week, feeble minds
As I die I'll go further, further than any other man
To obtain powers and wisdom as a God from the other end
My death will be revenged with fury of the damned
My eternal life will be praised by the gods at the end.

Um Kraft und Weisheit zu erreichen

Kaunis laiva kantaakseen saa miehen rauenneen,

Aseet, korut, rikkaudet matkamies saa mukaansa,

kuin hiljaisten liekkien kurotus tähtiä kohti.)

Kuolemaan me jok'ikinen kuljemme;

I'm just a latch key kid with a snotty nose
High school drop out
Space, I'm around me whiteout
And I ain't dealin with no minimum wage
I'd rather construct rhymes on a minimum page
Cynical ways, cats sin for nickels these days
Pulling the chrome out
And you actin like pullin the chrome out
Hated the sound of grandma's cryin the crooked letter
You could hear it from the ground or when the sky thunders
Made you wonder 'bout early
Sunday morning
Relatives dressed in black and they all mourning
Flows be bangin in the paint, throwin elbows
My first fight was me against five boroughs
I lost my first wish
But remembered every detail of my first kiss
That's that Bronx Tale bliss
The holiest of holies
Hip hop, it was '88
Even at the age of 10, phrases levitate
Drinkin Lil' Hug quarter waters
Dodgin stray slugs on the corner in that exact order
While you playin, death is what happens
I found the passion: aerosol cans and hands clappin
Backspins, microphones and cats rappin
Linoleum and up rockers, the show shockers
Who rip Lee patches off of imposters
You ain't the Real McCoy, you a wind up toy
And it's gonna cost ya
And that's my B-Boy Alpha

Straight outta the depths of hell
Reflect the sec-ond
Inhale the buddah wisdom
Envision and edit inscriptions of Vor-Megala spiritualism
Paint a picture from the spiritual
And seriously spit a lyric
That'll rip through a phsyical ligament
Trigger livin in these city limits
Limited with no money, goin through crazy minutes
Crazy thinkin of back in the days
When blazin a lazy ridance
Before we was swallowin duces, poppin with gooses
And rockin the bubble gooses
Trouble lose kid, puffin a loosie
Hoppin off Huffy, stealin Marvel comics and water uzis
All of us canoeing through sewers with juvenile manuevers
Caught up in nooses from borders with troubleshooters
On corners where coppers'll hop outta Dunkin Donuts
Poppin they gun and shoot us
Or more of us aware
Thinkin Rudy Guili really don't give a FUCK ABOUT A MOULE!
Got me woozy, sippin Kaluha's loosin my noodles

Sprayin it live, b-boy grafitti alpha

she walked with grace

I want you to want me.
I need you so badly,
I can't think of anything but you.

I want you to want me.
I need you so badly,
I can't think of anything but you.

And I think I'm going out of my head
'Cause I can't explain the tears that I she'd
Over you, over you.

I see you each morning
But you just walk past me
You don't even know that I exist

Going out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night wrong or right

I must think of a way into your heart
There's no reason why my being shy should keep us apart

And I think I'm going out of my head

Yes, I got up one mornin', for me I couldn't even get out of my door
Lord, that was really enough trouble
to make a poor man wonder why and where to go

And I waited, I stood upon a high, high old lonesome hill
Lord, I waited, I stood upon a high, high old lonesome hill
Lord, an' all I could do was look down on the house, baby, where I used to live

I know that I'm really not here
To represent what I'm not clear
About in my head 
Sometimes I feel fucked up just like you do,
Like you do

But everything that I can say to you 
Won't help you
Everything you need is right in front of you 
Just take it

Try to make it through the daily pain 
That you feel
Maybe tomorrow won't be so bad
I know it 

'cause
I once felt that way 
Nothing I could say 
Made it go away
I lived through this
I still feel this 
I just live for my tomorrow

And I respect a man who treats his woman like a queen
I know you're not perfect, you ain't gotta be so mean
No matter how strong she is for a woman
A man should never attempt to lay his hands on her

There's more to life than what happens on your block
Just treat your women right and hold 'em at the top
Gotta raise these kids and teach 'em, never don't ya stop
You ain't no man to me if you let your family starve

Got no respect for the fools who leave they children and
I just wanna take care of my family

Got no respect for the fools who leave they children and
I just wanna take care of my family

I respect the type of girl that tries to love a man
With many flaws and broken laws but still he stands
The kinda girl who turns a boy into a man
The kinda girl who turns a flop into a plan
No respect for those who walk through life just askin' you
What you can do for them but still they hate on you
It don't take no man to make that baby
But yes, it takes a man to raise that baby

There's more to life than what happens on your block
Just treat your women right and hold 'em at the top
Gotta raise these kids and teach 'em, never don't ya stop
You ain't no man to me if you let your family starve

Got no respect for them dudes who hit they women and
Got no respect for the fools who leave they children and
I just wanna take care of my family
Got no respect if you ain't trying to do the right thing

Fellas, we gotta make a change
In the way that we treat our women and our children, yes we do
Hope that there's a better day
Put your hands to the sky
If you want a change, need a change
See all that you know, it don't really mean a thing
If you can't show some love to the ones connected by your blood
'Cause in the end all that matters is your wife and your kids

Got no respect for them dudes who hit they women and
Got no respect for the fools who leave they children and
I just wanna take care of my family

Strewn across a blue blanket

Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy
With holes punched in it

I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

The world's a roller coaster
But I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying

I wish you were here

Inevitably you will agree, your fragile ego I'm denting 
Unnecessary jealousy, why are you resenting 
Lucky Boys Confusion ripping leaves off clovers 
Adam I'm about to send the limelight over, kid 
Well, hello my my how the tables have turned 
You got your new style and the tricks that you learned 
From me, go let go of the ghetto phase 
It's like everybody's trying to earn a buck these days 
Ripping off my kids, with your ziplock bags 
You think you're rolling now, you need to step the fuck back 
We'll take care of Arizona, handle the schwag 
Shorty got a brand new bag 
When say opportunity knock on me door 
Such a shame it's not the music, it's how much they score in their pocket 
Now, the band plays I see the dollar sign in your eyes 
But guess what Mr. Parasite we can see through all of your lies 
I'm rocking mic stands daily, I'm merely 
Two blocks away from the venue, 
It's not as if you can hear me, clearly 
Bringing up on the styles which were ours, nearly 
With help from the stars of the past 
Enhanced with your modern day melodies 
Beats that kick your ass and you agree 
I'm not up here to rock the room alone 
Stubhystyle pick up the microphone 
I'm back by popular demand, some people don't understand 
Why I'm laughing fucking up all the shit you planned 
Cause your motives weren't true and either were you 
Trying to figure out how I do the things I do 
A word of advice if you already haven't 
Go out, step out, special order some talent 
Don't say I'm not a musician cause I can hold my own 
And bitch I play the microphone 
Ooooh, mama did you hear they want make me superstar 
Ooooh, mama did you hear they're gonna make me a star 
You seemed startled by the way that I approach the mic 
But isn't my tongue spitting out all the things you like 
Mixing flavors together like Neapolitan, tight 
Clam baking the limousine 
He sprinkles on his stardust before he hits the street 
A victim of his ego, pop rock society 
His gear is nice and trendy; you got your baggy jeans 
He's got a few piercings but nothing to extreme 
Radio friendly writings is the highway to money 
Maybe we'll be stars if we give them what they need 
I get twelve percent off the music I make 
And the image that they're selling you is fake"

Forse non sarà domani
Ma un bel giorno cambierà

Ma vedrai che cambierà

Preferirei sapere che piangi
Che mi rimproveri di averti delusa
E non vederti sempre così dolce
Accettare da me tutto quello che viene
Mi fa disperare il pensiero di te
E di me che non so darti di più

She had some big ass breasts, I had to catch her like a short stop on the Mets
I nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best

And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Two fresh men from garbage can gave him nookies
Rolled the back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truck load of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat

Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums

When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound

Disguised by surroundings.
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.

A cactus on a warm summer night.
But the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright.
Black as night.
Cold as ice.
Warm as home.
Ready to live.
Stars they shoot.
In a clear.
Across the sky.
As does my time.
Waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion.
Crying, breaking, loving, nothing.

Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray,
The the thrushes they were warbling,
The violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay.

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season,
Though fortune does be pleasing I 'll go along with you,
I 'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish nation,
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I 'll bid adieu.

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience,
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away,
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation,
To comfort us hereafter all in Amerika y.

Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing,
T'will cause them for smile at our late going away,
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory,
We'll be drinking wine and porter all in Amerika y.

If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying,
The sight of the lovely Bann banks, your sorrow you'd give o'er,
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower,
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more.

Then fare you well, sweet Cragie Hills, where often times I've roved,
I never thought my childhood days I 'd part you any more,
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion,
And the bonny boats are sailing, way down by Doorin shore."

[Solos- P.S., J.M., P.S., J.M.]

Look through my eyes
See through my eyes
One could lose a lifetime
praying in isolation, Hidden
from the nature of chaos
The beauty of its patterns
beguiles
Like a falling trail
of cold semen
apon her face and breasts
Between the legs
hair shorn to sensitise

97,Lila Mccann,Lost In Your Love (LP Version),TRAXKWN12903CCFB9C,2001,"I couldn't name the last three songs
Or what that last exit sign said
I guess I'm hypnotized 
By those little white lines 
And tonight playin' back in my head
And there's no way to concentrate 
On anything but you
And I don't know just where I'm goin'
But all I wanna do is get...

Lost in your love
All mixed up
So completely turned around
You've got me in so deep
That I can't find my way out
But I know I found the place 
Where I belong
When we touch, I get lost in your love

I thought I had all the lines on the map picked out
To show me where to go
And I made up my mind, I was sure this time
I'd play it safe and take it slow
But now, I'm flying up so high so fast I can't let go
The first time I stepped on this ride
I guess I should've know that I'd get...

Lost in your love
All mixed up
So completely turned around
You've got me in so deep
That I can't find my way out
But I know I found the place 
Where I belong
When we touch, I get lost in your love

Lost in your love
All mixed up
So completely turned around

98,Dimmu Borgir,Indoctrination,TRMCHXE128F930D7CC,2001,"Oh, look at those lifeless leaves
All their precious pride is taken away
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear

On behalf of water made to wine
Elements of deception must entwine
Righteous greed and derangement divine
Vacuum is given to the blind

To surrender to a faith so fake
To not comprehend while you're awake
Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake

To lose your battle before actual birth
For some sheep need the company of a shepherd
To face the scorn of the earth

Existential parasite drama across the lands
What a relief, never bother the why's
Investing illusions and folding hands
The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies

All those naked faces, empty shells
Procreation of the mind put to rest
Crippled and caged, anaesthesia adjust
The lambs of slaughter preoccupied in disgust"
99,Les Savy Fav,Tragic Monsters,TRJAZIM128F1451D5F,2001,"What we don't know can fill a truck
What we don't know cannot hurt us
Well, is that so?
We're hard to destruct
Well, is that so?
Why do we get crushed?

Prepare the isolation chamber
I'm going in
And all the people there will wonder
""Can we go with him?""

Tell me now you're only kidding
When you say ""We'll pass away""
Tell me now this yarn we're spinning
Doesn't end on judgement day

All tragic monsters are crying for themselves
In attics and in basements
In cages and prison cells
Wishing that the citizen's myth they could dispel
Until you see the faces
In the limestone on the pipe
Don't tell the tragic monsters what loneliness is like

And is there any wonder
That some misfits lose their mind?
Left to fumble asunder
In the world deaf, dumb, and blind
And can they sense our justice
When they commit their crime?
How can they abide our justice?
They're already doing time

What we don't know (x7)
Can't hurt us yet"

You got the wrong ones, outnumber right ones
They ain't got enough ground to stand on
Where you lead them, they will follow
So fill them up with words that won't leave them hollow

He twist the truth into the most bent up phrases

How far had he walked? Nobody knows
Where had he come from? Nobody knows
How was he made? Nobody knows
Taller than a house, the Iron Man stood at the top of the cliff, in the darkness.

The wind sang through his iron fingers
And his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin but as big as a bedroom,
Slowly turned to the right
Slowly turned to the left
He was hearing the sea.

His eyes like headlamps, glowed white then red
Then infa-red, searching the sea
Never before had the Iron Man seen the sea.

He swayed in the strong wind that pressed against his back
He swayed forward, on the brink of the high cliff
And his right foot, his enormous iron right foot, lifted-up, out,
Into space,
And the Iron Man stepped forward, off the cliff, into nothingness
CRASH.

Down the cliff the Iron Man came toppling head over heels
CRASH!
CRASH!
CRASH!

From rock to rock, tumbling slowly,
And as he crashed and crashed his iron legs fell off,
His iron arms broke off, and the hands broke off the arms
His great iron ears fell off
And his eyes fell out
His great iron head fell off.

All the separate pieces tumbled scattered crashing
Bumping clanging down, on to the rocky beach below
Then silence.

Nobody knew the Iron Man had fallen
Nobody knew the Iron Man had fallen."

Now I'm trying to fill the void
I'm broken, always the same thing 
When other people are around
Like an unintended rescue the shadow mask 
Clings to my neck
Choking claws, playin' my part, 
Choking claws

I'd just like to be who I am
Where should I start to seek
In my reflection I learn
There's something behind

Tug of war
Between me, myself and I
I could scream but I laugh
I could breath but I lie
I could win but I loose
The dirty, greasy costume on my skin, 
I cannot push it away
Calm down, calm down 
Inhale the screaming silence

4 times:
I'd just like to be who I am
Where should I start to seek
In my reflection I learn
There's something behind"

And I have failed to tolerate society
Still I can't find what you adore
Inside, I hear the echoes of an inner war
Nothing can take the horror from me
Your sick world, the loss of all morality
My hate has grown as strong as my confusion
My only hope, my only solution
Is a violent revolution

Violent revolution, violent revolution
Reason for the people to destroy

I do not need a cause for my rage
I just despise the nature of the human race
When all I see is repulsion and hate
Violence becomes my only friend, my saving grace
When love is lost beyond your control
A pale shadow of lust cannot enlight your soul
So keep your ice-cold bitter illusions
I don't need your empty world
My only solution is a violent revolution

A Utopia will not come
Trust I cannot feel, only pain
And my burning mind has gone insane"

Com material de ... e muita coragem
Era tudo tão puro, tão seguro e verdadeiro
Curte pela curte, nem havia dinheiro
Só concertos de hardcore com o people lá da rua
Bezanas lixadas, cada um com a sua
Uma bola bem unida que juntava uma avenida
Tínhamos respeito por direito pela atitude
assumida
Sábado à tarde no Rock Rendez Vous para curtir um
trash
Muito suor, nódoa negra, muito cheiro de haxe
Putos atrevidos com muito feeling e vontade
Mas sem uma noção muito certa da realidade

Yo, Jay – E aquela guitarra marada?
Tenho saudades, bro – Bora dar uma matada!
Yo, Jay – E aquela guitarra marada?
Tenho saudades bro, bora dar uma matada!

Yo, Jay e aquela guitarra marada?
Uma Segovia prateada espacial e estrelada
Nem queria acreditar quando a compraste
Foi usada e massacrada em todo e cada traste
Malhas bem pesadas solos numa corda só
Não sabíamos distinguir o mi do sol, o ré do dó
Foi aí que tudo começou de certa maneira...
Concertos frente ao espelho fora de brincadeira
Telediscos imaginados até ao pormenor
Com cenários de luxo, kid – tudo do melhor 
Quem diria que iríamos chegar aqui?
Ainda há tanto para curtir – esta vai para ti

Yo, Jay – E aquela guitarra marada?
Tenho saudades, bro – Bora dar uma matada!
Yo, Jay – E aquela guitarra marada?
Tenho saudades bro, bora dar uma matada!

Mudaram os tempos, mas não mudaram as vontades
O feeling é o mesmo, só diferem as idades
Fazemos o que queremos, quase como queremos
Mas nas coisas importantes sabes a sorte que nós
temos
Ganhar alguma guita a fazer o que se gosta
Concertos flashados do interior até à Costa
O Guillaz a partir os camarins, mijar nas portas
dos hotéis
Fim da noite toda a gente aos papéis 
Ahh... tou na pausa com o Quacas, conosco nunca há
macas
E as mocas já são fracas
O puto v não pára quieto e já ninguém o vê
Ambos sabemos muito bem a fazer o quê

The little brook was babbling it's tune
The village bells at noon were gaily ringing
The world seem'd brighter than a harvest moon

For there within my arms I gently pressed you
And blushing red, you slowly turned away
I can't forget the way I once caressed you
I only pray we'll meet another day

I've really come a long way from the city
And though my heart's breaking I'll be brave
I've brought this bunch of flowr's, I think they're pretty
To place upon a freshly moulded grave

If you will show me, Father, where she's lying
Or if it's far, just point it out to me
Said he, ""She told us all when she was dying
To bury her beneath the apple tree""

In the shade of the old apple tree
Where the love in your eyes I could see
When the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird
Seem'd to whisper sweet music to me

I could hear the dull buzz of the bee
In the blossoms as you said to me
With a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you
In the shade of the old apple tree"

But we ventured onward through the Tundra of Tor
Soon I had attracted a posse of trolls
Who'd grown fat and sloppy from the roasting of souls...

But we were surrounded at the Valley of Krin
And it was a battle we never could win
But still I hacked madly with my back to a wall
Heeding the horn of my funeral call

The mutilated millions I was born to appall
Heads leap from shoulders as they flock the mall

Laid waste to usurpers 'till I stood all alone

Ripped out guts
Gouged out eyes

Now I've smartened up I'm turning my back
I don't need her I gave her a smack
She failed me over and over again no surprise there she was never a friend

I've been hanging at the end of her rope (a bitch called hope)
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
I'd have given her my heart and my dreams
She then strung me along threw away these years
Don't let that bitch take you for a ride like she took me
and took most everyone I know
So I've kicked the bitch to the curb
but in the end she's left me a bitter twisted motherfucker

Was it too much to live for
Once choice you felt you had to make

And I've pissed my time away
Through countless life long wasted days
Why are all the simple things so lost in sorrow
And my perspective so unclear

Life's cold and thick with lies
Seen through the blue black eyes
We squander as we smile
Things which once appeared worthwhile

How views on life distort
When we see a life cut short

Absentia renders no debate

hear them whispering how someone's gone,
someone's missing.

Don't you find it's hard to face the floor
Don't you ever make the same mistake
Only I can tell you but I wont say a word

I can't talk anymore *4

Can't pull the curtains
Cos theres something in the sky
The animal inside me
Sits and begs for suicide
And rain comes pouring through my pillow
I'm so affected by the smallest thing I do
Nothing I remember
Hurts me half as much as you

Look at my hands - pretty picture
Look at my head - simple head
Look at my eyes - in the mirror
Looks like someone else instead

I didn't learn about this at school
There's nothing in the papers
Or my discharge report
Someone on the phone
They got a message for my dog
Someones in the bathroom
When I want to use the bog

Angers on the road to pulling through
Can't you keep it quiet
I'll put a contract on you
Don't you say a word
Don't you even breathe a sigh
David's life's in danger
He's on permanent high

He can't talk anymore
I can't talk anymore
What did I do last night"

drunk after work, here in the late night feelings
that was the way, was the way that I found you
sat in the crowd, watching the women's tennis
that was the way, was the way that I found you
saw who you were, picking up from the canvas
that was the way; I was wrapped around you,
met you while you were switching on
and checked your box on the blue coupon
that was how...I...found...

125,Lucinda Williams,Out Of Touch,TRHHHDC128F148C3B5,2001,"Once in awhile we might pass on the street 
We nod we smile and we shuffle our feet
Making small talk standing face to face
Hands in our pockets cause we feel so out of place     
Our paths may cross again in some crowded bar   
We feel a little lost cause we've drifted away so far   
Hoping to find the right words to say    
We joke a little and then go on our way     
We are so out of touch  yeah 
We are so out of touch  yeah 
La    La    La    
La  la la    la                      
We speak in past tense and talk about the weather  
Half broken sentences we try to piece together    
I ask about an old friend that we both used to know    
You said you heard he took his life about five years ago     
We may pass each other  on the interstate   
We honk and cross over to the other lane   
Everybody's going somewhere everybody's inside    
Hundreds of cars hundreds of private lives 
We are so out of touch  yeah

126,Amorphis,Grieve Stricken Heart,TROWNWP128F428CB91,2001,"Your helping hand is killing me
If you see me suffer its not your victory
Sadistic forms of new way discipline
Like I love myself I love to sin

And I want More
And I want it Low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl

Look out for number one
I pray on you it has begun
Let the night stand one thousand years
Longstanding, Everlasting
Breathless masquerade
I'm your devil in disguise

And I want More
And I want it Low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl

Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only love you fools
I love my misery too

Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only love you fools
I love my misery too

I'm the one to see your collapse
I'm on the side of destruction
On the side of black and I love to sin
Mentally transmitted disease 
Rotten wretched attraction
And I... love myself

And I want More
And I want it Low
Of course you won't forgive me
But I won't crawl

Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only love you fools
I love my misery too

Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only love you fools
I love my misery too"
127,Antonio Vega,Para Bien Y Para Mal,TRFJKHZ128F9336095,2001,"Para bien y para mal
Fue que me deje llevar
Y si digo la verdad
No sabria por donde empezar
Una mano se ofreció
Nada tienes que temer
Me subio y me subio
Y mas tarde me dejo caer
Me fue llevando la corriendo
Alli donde no hacia pie
Nada dura para siempre 
Pero para siempre dije adios a ayer
Para mal y para bien
Fue que me deje traer
Si ahora miento creeme
No la quiero la mitad
De lo que creen
Me fue arrastrando la corriente
Alli donde no hacia pie
Nada dura para siempre
Y para siempre dije adios, ayer

Aguas tranquilas y rebeldes
Rio profundo llevame
Que como el cauce a la corriente
Solo puedo dejarla correr
Para bien y para mal
A mi lado duerme ya
Porque prefiero soñar
Que buscamos solo el mismo mar
Para bien y para mal"

Puppets are planted by the CIA
The New World Order of a new decay
It all goes to shit as the ignorant pray
And bullets and bombs kill all
You're to blame as you fall"
129,Spahn Ranch,Destruction,TRIGNCU128F425A2EA,2001,"Watch one choosing paths
Watch rooms filling gas
Another spins the barrel
Roulette and suicidal
She chose to vary it
Another clone to marry it
Soon degrade what it meant
Then the cold lines are sent
Destruction
Burning all it can
Induction
Another lost cause plan
You can see them turn
What they can't is what they yearn
Another line, another borrowed
Another lie turning bridal
The car drags the cans with speed
Black out another deed
Destruction
Burning all it can
Induction
Another lost cause plan
I see the ways
That the lines are drawn
I see the days
A cut in pay is formed
I see the play
How the script conformed
Watch one choosing paths
Watch rooms filling gas
Another spins the barrel
Roulette and suicidal
She chose to vary it
Another clone to marry it
Destruction
Burning all it can
Induction
Another lost cause plan
I see the ways
I see the days"
