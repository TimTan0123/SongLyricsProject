0,Bessie Smith,Careless Love Blues,TRQYSYF128F935F350,1925,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone"
1,Papa Charlie Jackson,All I Want Is A Spoonful,TRZKAOZ128F4280C36,1925,"I told you once, this makes twice
That's last dime, don't you call or write
'Cause all I want, honey babe, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

You can brown your gravy, fry your steak
Sweet mama, don't make no mistake
'Cause all I want, honey babe, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

Just as sure as the winter follows the fall
There ain't no one woman got it all
'Cause all I want, honey babe, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

Lucy Mae's a woman that you can't understand
Well she's lookin' for you or a monkey man
'Cause all I want, honey babe, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

Now, cool kind mama, says you needn't to stall
Throw it out the window, I'll catch it 'fore it falls
'Cause all I want, sweet mama, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

I got the blues so bad, I couldn't sleep last night
My cool kind mama want to fuss and fight
'Cause all I want, sweet mama, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

Now I'm so glad that the dog can't talk
If you [can, keep him/it/'er staked, save a morning walk]
'Cause all I want, sweet mama, is just a spoonful
Spoonful 

Now if you don't believe that I can run mighty fast
Ask that man that run me last
'Cause all I want, honey babe, is just a spoonful
Spoonful"
2,Papa Charlie Jackson,Maxwell Street Blues,TRIOMVJ128F9309AD1,1925,"I was walkin' down Morgan, stopped on Maxwell Street
I was walkin' down Morgan, stopped on Maxwell Street
I asked the desk sergeant what police brought my girl in off of the street

I stood and talked to the desk sergeant, 'til he went fast asleep
Hey, Hey, 'til he went fast asleep
'Cause I knew my mama got arrested on Maxwell Street

Lord,, I'm talkin' 'bout the wagon, talkin' 'bout the push cart, too
Lord I'm talkin' 'bout the wagon, talkin' 'bout the push cart, too
'Cause Maxwell Street's so crowded on a Sunday you can hardly pass through

There's a Maxwell Street Market, got Water Street Market, too
There's a Maxwell Street Market, got a Water Street Market, too
If you ain't got no money, the women got nothing for you to do

I got the Maxwell Street Blues, mama, and they just won't 'have
Hey Hey and they just won't 'have
'Cause the Maxwell Street women gonna carry me to my grave

I live six twenty-four, mama, and I'm talkin' to you
I live six twenty-four Maxwell, mama, and I'm talkin' to you
'Cause I swear I don't want the doodlie doodlie doodlie outta you"
3,Papa Charlie Jackson,Shake That Thing,TRUEUUK128F92FD462,1925,"Now down in Georgia they got a dance that's new
There ain't nothing to it, it's easy to do
They call it shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now it ain't no Charleston, ain't no Chicken Wing
All you got to do is to shake that thing
They call it shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now the old folks like it, the young folks too
The old folks showing the young folks how to do
They call it shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now get back to me they're dyin' to do
Let your mammy show you just how to do
They call it shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

I was walking down town and stumbled and feel
My mouth jumped open like a country well
Watching 'em shake that thing, aww, watching 'em shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now Grandpa Johnson grabbed Sister Kate
He shook her just like she's taking jelly from a plate
He told her shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now old Uncle Jack the jelly roll king
He just got back from shaking that thing
Now shake that thing, watchin' them all, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now old Uncle Moe he's sick in bed
His doctor says he's almost dead
From watchin' shake that thing, watching 'em all, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing

Now the folks in Georgia they done gone wild
Over this brand new dancing style
They call shake that thing, aww, shake that thing
I'm getting sick 'n' tired of telling you to shake that thing"
