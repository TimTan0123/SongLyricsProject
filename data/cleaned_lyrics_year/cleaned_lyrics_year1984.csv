0,Dio,Egypt (The Chains Are On),TRNRKBY128F145A3BC,1984,"In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine then the story's told, yeah
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew

That the chains were on
That the chains were on

My, my, my, in the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me, and that's free

But still your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still your chains are on

You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes

When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew, yeah

That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
That the chains were on
Oh my the chains were on

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still the chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on

Hey, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Yeah, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on
Hey, the chains are on

You've seen them walking on the water
Oh the chains are on
You've seen flying through the sky
My, the chains are on
They were frightening in the darkness
Yes, the chains are on
They had rainbows in their eyes
Hey, the chains are on
Oh the chains are on"
1,Trouble,Victim Of The Insane,TRROGKT12903CBD782,1984,"You want the world to buy your happiness
Ain't it a shame you have to hurt the ones you love
Never giving yourself taking all that you can get
But you don't take nothing with you except your soul

I'm so tired of hearing that I'm wrong
Everyone laughs at me. Why me?
I'm so tired of being pushed around
I feel like I've been betrayed

We take each other's love, forget to give back
Isn't it a pity, how we break each other's hearts
I know we're only human and not to blame
But who the hell are you to cause so much pain

I'm so tired of hearing that I'm wrong
Everyone laughs at me. Why me?
I'm so tired of being pushed around
I feel like I've been betrayed

Why do you criticize me
What have I done to deserve such a fate
Why do you look at me that way
Because of all your tears your eyes can't hope to see
See that we are all the same
We are not perfect, just forgiven
Open your eyes and set yourself free
Before we are all victims of the insane"
2,Bangles,Hero Takes A Fall,TRACYMM128F9303A59,1984,"The hero is exposed when
His crimes are brought to the light of day
Won't be feeling sorry, sorry, sorry
On the judgement day
Wasn't it me who said
There'd be a price to pay
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall

Your mother told you stories
You substitute with girls who tell you more
Suddenly your sycophants are chanting
Slogans at your door
We're seeing you through now
I saw it all before
And I won't feel bad at all 
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Emotion is a virtue
For you it is the one fatal flaw
Sitting on your throne and drinking
Thinking she'll return your call
Every story's got an ending
Look out, here it comes, here it comes
And I won't feel bad at all
When the hero takes a fall
When the hero takes a fall

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
3,George Michael,Careless Whisper,TRHEOJO128F42597F9,1984,"Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the hole you find

Should have known better, yeah
Oh, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the hole you find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
(Should have known better, yeah)
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"
4,The Jazz Butcher,Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present,TRCCMIK128F422DCE8,1984,"Let's go, let's go... One, Two, Three, Four....
ESTER!
Burke and Hare!
ESTER, I'm coming for you, ESTER, ESTER.
SAUSAGES! SAUSAGES! ESTER! ESTER! SAUSAGES!
We're gonna tell you something really big (ESTER!)
Like the Alice Cooper Group.
ESTER! Alice Cooper, baby! Alice Cooper!
Uh-uhrrrmm... Like the Alice Cooper Group.
Do you wanna touch me? DEAD BABIES!

See, there's been some big, big things, and some are bigger than others,
And when one might get up and go out of the room, he gets replaced with another.
Now some of these are monsters, the kind that live in the lakes (WHEURRRR!)
And other kinds are like Metal Men, and other kinds are BIG SNAKES.
But they don't look like nothing, they don't look like nothing at all.
They don't look like nothing when you put them up against Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present.
That's: CAROLINE WHEELER'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
Did ya get that, Joe? (CRAZY!) ESTER, I'M WAITING...
Ner! Ner! Ner!
SAUSAGES! Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present was made entirely from the skins of dead Jim Morrisons (Scattered over dawn's bleeding highway, I suppose...): that's why it smelled so bad.
Caroline Wheeler checked into the lobby of the Bruce Grobelaar Leisure Centre
( Liverpool and Zimbabwe goalkeeper of the 1980's )
(they check in, but they don't check out) - she was looking for a room where she could sit down and get herself back in order (ORDER!)...
SHEESH!, thought Caroline, What the HELL was that? (Edgar Wallace!)
So she goes to the elevator, she thinks ""Well, that'll be pretty straightforward"" (Yes, STRAIGHT UP, Caroline...) You know what she finds?
The elevator breaks down with Caroline and the fish in it.
(Fish?) (Uh-oh...)
Do you know what happens if you leave a fish too long in an elevator?
You don't? (Uncontrollable Celtic whooping from Jones)
Well, here's a clue: fish is biodegradable. (THAT MEANS IT ROTS.)
Ner! Ner! Ner!

Well, there's some big, big things and they travel in big, big cars:
Cars like a Mercedes with a big tow-bar (WHERE'S ESTER?)
But there ain't no vehicle big enough,
They just ain't built the vehicle big enough yet to hold the thing that men call Caroline Wheeler's Birthday Present (caroline wheeler's birthday present)
That's: CAROLINE WHEELER'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
(Heck! Here comes the hell drivers!)
(Vroom!)
(OUCH!)"
5,Deniece Williams,Black Butterfly,TRAYZWJ128F933672D,1984,"Morning light, silken dream take flight
As the darkness gives way to the dawn
You've survived, now your moment has arrived
Now your dream has finally been born
 
Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time
Can catch your wings

Ooh-ooh...

While you slept, the promise was unkept
But your faith was as sure as the stars
Now you're free, and the world has come to see
Just how proud and beautiful you are

Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the wind can catch your wings

Let the current lift your heart and send it soaring
Write your timeless message clear across the sky
So that all of us can read it
And remember, when we need it
That a dream conceived in truth can never die
Butterfly

'Cause now you're free, and the world has come to see
Just how proud and beautiful you are

Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and your daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
set the skies, set them on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time
Can catch your wings

Fly

Yeah, yeah, yes
Fly"
6,Ultravox,A Friend I Call Desire (Work In Progress Mix),TRKMHMS12903C9854E,1984,"You live for love, I long for it
You give for love, I take from it
This friend of mine, desire
This lovers crime, desire
Emotion driving all the time
A burning need for things not mine
Desire

You need your love
I walk from it
You fight for love
I run from it
My enemy desire
Caressing me, desire
The torch I carried burnt my hand
I can't control what I can't stand
Desire

You give for love, I lie for it
You give for love, I shy from it
And the pain, and the lust, and the want
And the hurt, and the lies
And the fears, and the urge, and the feel
And the touch, and it's all
A friend I call desire

You give for love, I lie for it
You give for love, I shy from it
And the pain, and the lies
And the touch, and it's all
A friend I call desire"

8,The Flying Pickets,Only You,TRKBPSO128F1468CEE,1984,"Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love, can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
We're moving farther away, want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
When it's only a game and I need you
Listening to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay when I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine, can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand behind the closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you"
9,Richard Thompson / Linda Thompson,A Heart Needs A Home,TRPTAJL128E0784549,1984,"I know the way that I feel about you
I'm never gonna run away
I'm never gonna run away
I never knew the way when I lived without you
I'm never gonna run away
I'm never gonna run away

I came to you when no one could hear me
I'm sick and weary of being alone
Empty streets and hungry faces
The world's no place when you're on your own
A heart needs a home

Some people say that I should forget you
I'm never gonna be a fool
I'm never gonna be a fool
A better life they say if I never met you
I'm never gonna be a fool
I'm never gonna be a fool

Tongues talk fire and eyes cry rivers
Indian givers, hearts of stone
Paper ships and painted faces
The world's no place when you're on your own
A heart needs a home"
10,Los Lobos,I Got To Let You Know,TRASCPD12903D081D0,1984,"You know your love for me
Has given me a thrill
And I just can't stand still
Pretty baby, you know I love you so
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know

You know your kiss kiss kiss
Has set me off my feet
And that just can't be beat
Pretty baby, with any other girl
Because I love you and I want you, baby
I got to let you know

Every night in my dreams
I can hold you near
Even then I still feel
That loving you is real
You know my love's still strong
And I'm still holdin' on
Ain't nothing we can't do
Pretty mama, you know I love you so
Because I love you and I want you,baby
I got to let you know

Uhm, so good...

Every night in my dreams

11,Spinal Tap,Sex Farm,TRPHWAI128E0793DA7,1984,"Working on a sex farm
Trying to raise some hard love
Getting out my pitch fork
Poking your hay

Scratching in your henhouse
Sniffing at your feedbag
Slipping out your back door
Leaving my spray

Sex farm woman, I'm gonna mow you down
Sex farm woman, I'll rake and hoe you down
Sex farm woman, don't you see my silo rising high?

Working on a sex farm
Hosing down your barn door
Bothering your livestock
They know what I need

Working up a hot sweat
Crouching in your pea patch
Plowing through your beanfield
Planting my seed

Sex farm woman, I'll be your hired hand
Sex farm woman, I'll let my offer stand
Sex farm woman, don't you hear my tractor rumbling by?

Working on a sex farm
Trying to raise some hard love
Getting out my pitch fork
Poking your hay"
12,The Jacksons,One More Chance,TRMRVNR128F92F1672,1984,"Everybody loves the star 
When he's on the top 
But noone ever comes around 
When he starts to drop 

But you were someone special 
You stuck through thick and thin 
But I was much too busy 
Trying to shine 
To let your love shine in 

Let you slip away 
I must have been insane 
Stop in the name of love 
Don't make me live my life in vain 

(Chorus) 
Give me one more chance 
That's all I ask of you 
Just one more chance 
I'll make it up to you 
Just one more chance 
That's all I ask of you 
I'll build you a world for two 
I'll make it up to you 

Now since I'm all alone 
I'm talking to myself 
I know you're out there somewhere 
Having fun with someone else 

But a distant voice of hope 
Echo from within, sayin' 
(Don't give up) 
(Your ship is comin' in) 

Though my ship's alone 
I'll play right to the end 
I'm crying outside 
heaven's door 
Won't you let me back in 


You'll never know 
What I've been through 
Let your love shine in again 
This time I'll shine with you"
13,U2,Pride (In The Name Of Love),TRNQYVK128F932A828,1984,"One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?"

15,Laurie Anderson,Walk the Dog,TRUOIBT128F428C1FF,1984,"I saw a lot of trees today. And they were all made of wood.
Well, they were wooden trees—and they were made entirely of wood.

Well, I came home today and you were all on fire. Your shirt was on fire.
And your hair was on fire. And flames were licking all around your feet.
And I did not know what to do. And then a thousand violins began to play.
And I really did not know what to do then, so I just decided to go out—
And walk the dog.

I went to the movies, and I saw a dog thirty feet high.
And this dog was made entirely of light. And he filled up the whole screen.
And his eyes were long hallways. He had those long, echoing, hallway eyes.

I turned on the radio and I heard a song by Dolly Parton. And she was singing:
Oh! I feel so bad! I feel so sad! I left my mom and I left my dad.
And I just want to go home now.
I just want to go back to my Tennessee mountain home now.
Well, you know she's not gonna go back home. And I know she's not gonna go back home.
And she knows she's never gonna go back there.
And I just want to know who's gonna go and walk her dog. (Her dog.)

Oh! I feel so bad. I feel so sad. 
But not as bad as the night I wrote this song.

Close your eyes. OK. Now imagine you're at the most wonderful party. OK.
Delicious food. Uh-huh. Interesting people. Uh-mm. Terrific music. Mm mmh.
NOW OPEN THEM!"

Oh, so much for subtlety 
I can't wait for you to get your hands on me

Oh, take me, take me, please 
Oh, take me, take me

Don't leave me at the door with a good night kiss 
It's guys like you can give a girl a complex

19,Spinal Tap,Stonehenge,TRECRCA128E0793DA8,1984,"In ancient times
hundreds of years 
before the dawn of history
There lived a strange race of people - the druids.

No one knows who they were, 
or what they were doing.
But their legacy remains 
hewn into the living rock of Stonehenge.

Stonehenge - where the demons dwell
Where the banshees live 
and they do live well
Stonehenge - Where a man is a man 
and the children dance 
to the pipes of pan

Stonehenge - 'tis a magic place 
where the moon doth rise
With a dragon's face
Stonehenge - where the virgins lie
And the prayer of devils 
fills the midnight sky

And you my love, 
won't you take my hand
We'll go back in time 
to that mystic land
Where the dew drops cry 
and the cats meow
I will take you there
I will show you how

And oh, how they danced
the little children of Stonehenge 
Beneath the haunted moon 
for fear that daybreak might come too soon 

And where are they now, the little people of Stonehenge?
And what would they say to us if they were here tonight?"

You're outta my sight I'm outta my mind
We never bargained or planned on this
We gotta hold on hold on

CHORUS
I'm with you
Hold me in your heart
Keep the fire strong
Without you
Not really apart
Our love goes on and on

When we're together we pretend
That we can take the time 'cuz it'll never end
It was so easy when love began
We gotta hold on hold on

Now I'm off another city in sight
And I remember each and every night
When I could touch you it felt so right
that's why I hold on hold on

CHORUS
I'm with you
Keep me in your mind
Relive each memory
I'm waiting
No matter how long
Until you're holding me"

I was dropping past
You know I missed you
Since I saw you last

It gets lonely
Since you haven't been around
Little things don't make me cry
But still I think you could've told me why
You had to move out to the other side of town

Ahhh, you caught me out
Ahhh, you caught me out
But when I saw you (saw you)
Walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take anymore
I started cryin'
Oooh, oooh, oooh

Every night I lie awake
Afraid what shape my dreams might take
I call your name out
But I never hear a sound

You can say there's no love lost
But now I sit down and I count the cost
I wasn't ready
To surrender what I found

Ahhh, you caught me out
Ahhh, you caught me out
But when I saw you (saw you)
Walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take anymore
I started cryin'
Oooh, oooh, oooh

Doesn't seem there's any way
To say the things I want to say
It's too late for me to explain
I love you

Ahhh, you caught me out
Ahhh, you caught me out
But when I saw you (saw you)
Walking out the door
You know I just couldn't take anymore

Encendi un cigarrillo.

So wie er mal war zuvor
Niemand kommt zweimal auf Erden
Durch ein und dasselbe Tor

Niemand kann zurück sich regen
Weil er immer reifer wird
Niemand kann sich frei bewegen
Hat er sich einmal verirrt

Jeder lebt sein eignes Leben
Atmet ein und atmet aus
Will sich nicht im Schmerz ergeben
Braucht mehr Liebe als Applaus

Kaum einer ist wie ein andrer
Kann nicht immer erster sein
Mancher bleibt ewig ein Wandrer
Auf der suche nach dem neuen

Niemand wird so wieder werden
So wie er mal war zuvor
Niemand kommt zweimal auf Erden
Durch ein und dasselbe Tor

Jeder lebt sein eignes Leben
Atmet ein und atmet aus
Will sich nicht dem Schmerz ergeben
Braucht mehr Liebe als Applaus

Und so Leben wir ein Leben

Werden nehmen werden geben
Zwischen Liebe und Applaus"

At the bullriders riding on rhinos

Spring in the air (filled with love),
There's magic everywhere,
When you're young and in love.

Life seems to be (just a dream),
A world of fantasy,
When you're young and in love.

Each night seems just like the 4th of july,
With stars that spangle the sky.

The moon at night (shines so bright),
Seems to shine twice as bright,
When you're young and in love.

Dreams can come true (cry a dream),
If you believe they do,
When you're young and in love.

Chorus:
So many teardrops about to fall.
True love can conquer all,
When you're,
When you're young and in love.

Trust and you'll find (ooo),
There's no mountain you can't climb,
When you're young and in love.

Chorus:
So many teardrops about to fall.
True love can conquer all.

Spring in the air (ooo),
There's magic everywhere,
(when you're young and in love).

Dreams can come true (cry a dream),
If you believe they do,
When you're young and in love.

True love can conquer all,
When you're,
When you're young and in love,

Shoot the guns

Hoofs gallop in thunderous pound
Devouring the souls of the wretched
Trampling them down to the ground

Gripping the reins of destruction
Made of steel on his hands
Holder of forces immortal
Slaughtering all in his path"

De cables, putas y Dios, y de esta gente que espera.

Una pianola de azul. muy vieja adulta y sin voz. 
Y se abre como una flor ante un acorde sutil, 
Y cierra su corazón si lo abandono en abril. 
Mi piano un poco soy yo, yo soy un poco de él, 
Hermanos en la prisión, viajando en un carrousell 
Tus cuatro patas piden fiesta entonces hay que dársela, oh!

Making pretty speeches trying to appeal
If the left-one don't get us then the right one will

You put on my table ?
Are these clothes yours
You put on my back?
Is this ground where I sleep?
These shoes on my feet?
If they are  you can take them all back"

Along about nine o'clock
His memory was history
Before she hit the parking lot
She busted through them swingin' doors
Sashaying to and fro
She's got a new attitude yes she's over that dude
And she wants the world to know that

(Oh yes) She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight

Just like a kid in a candy store
She's checking out the merchandise
But she wants to find the keeping kind
Who will keep her satisfied



And he's gotta be strong gotta be tough
And he's gotta have a tender touch
So if you fit the bill brother don't sit still
Come on step right up 'cause

(Oh yes) She feels like a brand new man tonight
She didn't come in here to hang her head and cry
She's through throwing good love away
On some boy that don't treat her right
She feels like a brand new man tonight

(Oh yes) She feels like a brand new man tonight

For me the fight has just begun.
You get in clubs, drink alcohol,
It makes you feel you're ten feet tall.

I don't wanna grow up,
I'm never getting old.
I'd rather work from 9 to 5
Than drink to stay alive.
I'm gonna stay young until I die! (x2)

Estoira no peito um grito, à desfilada

Cresce, girassol, cresce entre açucenas
Afaga-me o corpo todo, se te pertenço
Rasga-me o ventre ardendo em fumo de incenso

Lembra-me um sonho lindo, quase acabado
Lembra-me um céu aberto, outro fechado
Estala-me a veia em sangue, estrangulada

Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove

If you don't slow down I swear that I'll come round
And mess up your place let's go for a spin
They say we shouldn't even know each other
And that we'll be undone
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire

I believe in love...I'll believe in anything
That's going to get me what I want and get me off my knees
And then we'll burn your house down 
Don't it feel so good?
There's a forest fire every time we get together

We're going to pick you up - put you down
Rip you up and spin you round
Just like we said we would
Because we're a forest fire
Believe we be - we'll tear this place down

If we get caught in this wind then we could burn the ocean
If we get caught in this scene we're going to be undone
It's just a simple metaphor it's for a burning love

Going strong

More I need, To satisfy Furthermore, never could mean a lot
Just tell me now, I wanna know why

Am I looking at you for the last time in a million years ?
Is there something you want to say ?

Don't you know I can read your mind ?
Probably do it the second time
On a day when I know it clear.

There's a town I know
Where the man who can sell his shoes and he know's it's for the last time
But he's knows he got nothing to lose.

Lose or win doesn't end the game
And I think we'll end up the same

Il silenzio gioverà.
Tanta gente che non c'è,
Ma che porto dentro me.

E cambiavo senza quasi accorgermi,
Una stanza e tanta fanasia.
Mi cercavo senza riconoscermi
E volevo sempre andare via.

Cosa sono adesso tu non devi chiederlo.
Non lo so neanch'io. Inganno o verità?
Il presente è sempre qui,
Ma lo butto via così
E passato diverrà.
Sempre a chiedermi perchè
E a combattere col 'se'.

Ora cambio senza quasi accorgermi,
E combatto con la fantasia.
E mi cerco senza riconoscermi
E voglio sempre andare via.

Chi diventerò non posso immaginarmelo.
Dove finirò?In quale realta?
Il futuro inizia qui,
Il destino va così.
Forse mi accontenterà.
Chi sarà vicino a me?
E, se esiste, ma dov'è?

Cambierò senza quasi accorgermi,
Perderò contro la mia fantasia.
Cercherò ma senza riconoscermi.
Riuscirò alla fine a andare via. (2 volte)"

Une confiance en je ne sais quoi

Y'a pas de suicide au Sahel
Pas de psychiatre en plein désert
Pas d'overdose à Kinshasa

Pour bâtir, il fallait des mains
Des bras, des muscles masculins
Pour l'amour et l'imaginaire
C'est peut-être affaire de mères

Petite fille, à quoi tu rêves
Y'a tant de baudruches qui crèvent
Y'a tant d'idées vieilles et froissées
C'est le moment d'imaginer
Petite fille, à quoi tu penses
Entre un plaisir et deux romances
Va puiser d'autres solutions
J'ai besoin d'une transfusion

Est-ce blessure, est-ce naissance ?

Weigh on me worthless 
And I shake them down and leave now
And have no royal things

You
Would consecrate the ground I paced in pain
And though those pavements
Caught your sorrow stains,
They fall from me and I say
Maybe don't fall for anything
That says it's never gonna give you everything.

I wish myself into your arms
To know that all I need is everything

The size of the sea
And the sun in my eyes
And the line in my head
Yearning for more
Only for more

These days are are bright 
As the days I have seen
In the wildest of dreams
Yearning for more
Only for more

I wish myself into your arms
To know that all I need is everything

Hold back the night

Now this rain is not something I adore
but I was standing there hoping to open up the door
I looked around
put a hand into my pocket
And found a book that I had lost
I was dressed in black
feeling out of time
just waiting for that shiny Cadillac
baby send one out to bring me back
There was no one there to tell me
And I myself I couldn't see
that the hour hadn't come
So it's left with only roses
And an uphill climb in sight
no more dancing in the wasteland
I was too wasted anyhow
I placed one hand on my forehead
I shook the other one and sighed
in the now dead room
And the only child
listen....
No one was there to tell me
And I myself I could not see
that the hour hadn't come"

With her nails painted red
And her hair so unnaturally curled
Well I think that she may be
The oldest baby in the world

She's tasted the night life
But it's left her with nothing but hunger
And all the available men
Seem to think that they want something younger
But youth is a costume
And the beauty within lies unfurled
And I think that she may be
The oldest baby in the world

Fast horses win races
And royal flushes beat aces
And everyone's playing to keep
So let's turn out the lights
And rock that old baby to sleep

She loves the sound of the rain
But you know she's still afraid of the thunder
She keeps a head full of hope
And a heart that's so full of wonder
She may look like a woman
But she's still some daddy's little girl

Searching for the undeniable truth that
A man is just a fool

Don't know why this evil bothers me
Take another chance boy, carry the fight,
You can take him if you're fast
So why is he trying to follow me?
Didn't I say if you're holding on
You'd be laughing at the last
How many reasons do they need?
I get along fine with them friends of mine
But you have to make a choice
I might just believe this time
You're singing out of tune but the beat's in time
And it's us who makes the noise

I'm talking for free, I can't stop myself,
It's a new religion
I've something to see, I can't help myself,
It's a new religion"

Can’t you see it’s common sense
Still stockpiles build up on each side of the fence
Sometimes they meet &amp; talk
They talk of peace &amp; war
Always talks fail &amp; they want to fight it here
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
Play the game
Like toys
The signs are everywhere land, sea &amp; air
Because of our silence they think we don’t care
But we do care don’t we?
Christ! Its our world too
They’re taking the piss out of me &amp; you
Surely together we can begin to create a life for ourselves
Not based on power and greed
Is there really no room in our world for caring &amp; sharing?
No room in our hearts &amp; minds so we can start preparing?
Government &amp; military leaders don’t care how we feel as they plan our
downfall
If it’s o.k. for them
Then its o.k. for us all
Just work for them &amp; their security &amp; they’ll see us all o.k.
&amp; don’t worry about the risks
It’s got good pay
But what good is the cash to your family &amp; future when both start to decay
Tell me how d’you make a living from death &amp; destruction?
Mining, refining, building, designing
You’re creating the holocaust
Making a living from the missiles, until the missiles fall
Seems so contradictory
It will destroy us all
Stupidity is the name of the game
’Cos in this game
Defence is a threat which can turn to attack
Too late when we get to the point where there's no turning back
Still it’s just a job, who cares anyway?
Lets go on make believing the threat will go away
This government will sort it out
They care
They’ll see us all o.k
So let’s sit tight &amp; hope our make believe won’t just blow away
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
Play the game
No noise (for a while)
A limited war they said
Limited to what millions dead?
They’ve killed &amp; wanna kill again
But they mustn’t fight it here
They’ve got no right to fight it anywhere
Tell them straight if you care
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
It ain’t employ
It is destroy
No way
No more"

Kiss your mother goodnight and remember that God saves.""

And close your eyes, dear, and count to seven

I pushed with all my might, I pushed with all my love

Gather round, boys, to this tale that I tell

It's guaranteed to get your own place in Hell
Just take your lovely daughter and push her in the well
Take your lovely daughter and throw her in the well

Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

Why don't you do what you do
When you did what you did to me?
Love was so good that it filled up all my needs

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Why don't you say what you say
When you say what you said anymore?
Your eyes couldn't lie
So long goodbye, close the door

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Tell me something I didn't do
Why did someone else have to pull you through?
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?
Love like this must take flight

Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me?
Remember the one we made love to endlessly

I was crazy for you
You were crazy for me
And how could something so right go so wrong
My love, sweet love

Why don't you do what you do

Contemplating

If you're aching

Let the four winds blow

And this is why I must go
Why I must go

Would be an empty place
Your tenderness, your sweet caress
Would never be replaced

Tomorrow's world is full of laughter
But our dreams could easily fade and die
If you go there's no happy after ever
We must stay together, make it last forever
(Oh) my love
If you ever go away

My world without your love
Would never be the same
No one to care, no life to share
I know that I can't face

My world without your love
Would be a tragedy
Don't let it be my destiny
A world without your love"

Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Butterfly, spread
Your painted wings
From an answer
From the Ching

By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh, yeah
Watching for the coins to fall

With eyes bigger than our bellies 
We want to but we can't look away

Eventually you'll shack those shackles off 
(Dreams above those eyes)

But we know we love extremes 
Getting to grips with the ups and downs 
Because there's nothing in between

Lookin' 'round at all the faces
I can see they're all the same
Drifting shadows on the sidewalk
Slowly walking in the rain

The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
And I follow, through rain and sun

But you see I'm walking in my sleep

And I don't know how I got here
(and I don't know, no)
And when I try to keep the beat,
you see I'm walking in my sleep

Didn't know that I was dreaming
Sunny days come out of midnight
In the darkness of the evening
Running softly from the light

The moon shines down, she sees, she knows
The star, the end, the tide, the flow
The night, so black, it looks so real
Am I awake, or am I dreaming still?

But you see I'm walking in my sleep
(can't you see I'm walking in my sleep?)
And I don't know how I got here

I'm by a window, the night so cold
My mind, my body, my room, this heat
A drain is pouring into the street

Cause we're in a gang 
Parties that we go end up in a bang 
Look at us funny and we'll shoot you dead 
While we're there we'll fill 'em with lead 
We follow the gangs, we are the worst 
We'll be the last one, 
But we weren't the first 
We've been in a gang for a year and a half 
There goes our future, 
But we live in the past 
Let's go out, shoot some people tonight 
We use guns, cause we don't wanna lose the fight 
When we fight, it's 20 on 1 it's funny that way, 
It's much more fun everyone knows that we're so bad 
Our knives are long and our day is short 
Our nights our long, and our days are sad

Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I never heard you laugh

So who is rich and who is poor
I cannot say

You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen
In the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost
Well, this is true and yet it's false
But did I ever tell you, by the way
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I never really heard you laugh

So who is rich and who is poor
I cannot say

You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied
To the back of your car"

Suspicion's rising
Answers aren't clear
I thought we made a promise
Now you've disappeared
You seem to lead
Two lives at a time
Do I still fit in
I thought you were mine

Sitting at the bar
In our favorite café
I turn to see you laughing with her
And your smile fades away
Didn't suprise me
There's nothing left to say
I've got you red-handed now
And you can't walk away

You were caught in the act
When you thought I wasn't looking at you
C-I-T-A
I can see what you're doing
Caught in the act
And I can't stand to hear your lies
Caught in the act
Don't you try to change my mind

Called me the only
You said, ""She's only a friend""
Huh
Don't pretend you're sorry
My heart will mend
Don't you come back to me
Don't you try to call
You couldn't hold my heart with love
Now you can't hold me at all

The place is crowded
Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead
(Dancing in the sheets)

Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I wanna take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me we should be dancing in the sheets

We feel the rhythm
We've got the music on our side
If we go with 'em
I'll bet we'll have a wonderful ride

Your hands are cold
So maybe we could make some heat
Love is always born on a chance
So wrap around me and baby let's dance

So you think that down's
The only way out
A sad excuse for lovers
With your head held high
And your heart still full of doubt
It's just like you to scorn
The only one who'll mourn
The day he doesn't love you

Chorus:

When the time comes I'll cry
On the day you cut the thread
When my heart tears I'll cry

So you gave up giving
And you sit and smile
When the awkward silence falls
Deny the life you're living
Just a fleeting love
That you only half recall
It's just like you to make
A passion turned to hate
The day he doesn't love you

(Chorus)

Still we're here together
Feeling helpless as our heaven turns to hell
The taker and the giver
Washed in anger
When we think how far we fell
It's just like you to take
The step than makes the break
The day he doesn't love you

When the time comes I'll cry
When the time comes I'll cry
When the time comes I'll cry
When the time comes I'll cry"
130,Leonard Cohen,Night Comes On,TRSDABQ128F42671BB,1984,"I went down to the place
Where I knew she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow
I said, Mother I'm frightened
The thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone
She said, I'll be with you
My shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go
And the night came on
It was very calm
I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, Go back to the World

We were fighting in Egypt
When they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die
There was this terrible sound
And my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side
He said, Try to go on
Take my books, take my gun
Remember, my son, how they lied
And the night comes on
It's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young

We were locked in this kitchen
I took to religion
And I wondered how long she would stay
I needed so much
To have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way
But my son and my daughter
Climbed out of the water
Crying, Papa, you promised to play
And they lead me away
To the great surprise
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the World

Now I look for her always
I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer
Saying, When will she summon me
When will she come to me
What must I do to prepare
When she bends to my longing
Like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air
And the night comes on
And it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song

Now the crickets are singing
The vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair
I'll go down to Bill's Bar
I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there
Yes, and here's to the few
Who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care
And the night comes on
It's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
But she says, Go back, go back to the World"

queimam no asfalto
Os carros passam -
vêm e vão
Eu dobro a esquina
Eu vou na onda
Pego carona na multidão
Você olhor, fez que não me viu
Virou de lado, acenou com a mão
Pegou um taxi, entrou, sumiu
Deixou o resto de mim no chão
Vai ver que a confusão
Fui eu que fiz Fui eu
Há algo errado no araíso
É muito mais que contradição
Sou eu caindo num precipício
Você passando num avião
Você olhou, fez que não me viu
Foi como se eu não estivesse ali
Desligou a luz, deitou, dormiu

When it got a hold of me
Still recovering from my last time out 
Doing my best to learn to live without it
Just when I thought all my feelings had died 
Something came over me that can't be denied

Don't under estimate the power of love
You're never down so low that it can't lift you up
Don't under estimate what it can do
I'm living proof of the power of love.

It didn't hit me like lightening 
From a dark and stormy sky
It came on more like a peaceful wind
It made me feel like trying again
I didn't realize how good it could be
Until love worked its magic on me.

Don't under estimate the power of love
You're never down so low that it can't lift you up
Don't under estimate what it can do
I'm living proof of the power of love.

What can I do?

And with that voodoo
I keep thinking of you

What can I do?

And I'm so, so, so much calmer, I feel better
'Cause the stars already crossed our paths forever
And the sooner that we realize it, the better

Sounds of metal crashing the avenue overlords
Kings of black leather with words made of steel
Lock all your doors very soon you will feel

Under the knife. Feel the revenge. 
Under the knife. You'll get it in the end. 
Under the knife. You'd better run for your life. 
'Cause you're under the knife! 

Bishops of the street, authors of corruption, leaders
in the night just waiting for an eruption. 
A rider dressed in black screams out
""You fuckin' clowns! Bring your best you fools and I will tear him to the ground!"" 

Hear the rumble around you, it's a blood curdling sound
Blood stained heads and bodies all are breaking on the ground
A .45 caliber flashing life's ending with a bang

His friends smiled and raised a glass then drank another beer
Their hearts were strong with feelings for they knew what they had found
A whole new world was waiting for the men who stood their ground
The time was right 
The time was right
But the time for truth was over
The time was right 
The time was right
But now that time is dead and gone
People cried tears of blood 
as the young men marched away
Prayers were heard from the crowd 
""Return them safe one day""
But all night long as darkness filled the sky
The old man's friend was dreaming of the day when he would die
The sun shone on the battlefield where a lonely figure stands
Full of shame he cries out loud this is something I don't understand
The days are short but the nights so long when you can't stop thinking back
Betray your trust to someone and he'll stab you in the back"

Heavy duty
Brings out the duty in my soul

I see you dancing there in front of the band
You're playin' the solos with no guitar in your hand
I don't pull no punches I wouldn't waste your time
And just cause it pays, that ain't no crime

Heavy, duty
Heavy duty rock and roll
Heavy duty
Brings out the duty in my soul

Don't need a woman, I won't take me no wife
I get the rock and roll and that'll be my life

How I miss you, when I miss you, love
And though
All the days that pass me by so slow
All the emptiness inside me flows, all around
And there's no way out
I'm just thinkin' so much of you
There was never any doubt...
I can wait forever, if you say you'll be there, too
I can wait forever, if you will, I know it's worth it all
To spend my life alone with you

When it looked, as though my life was wrong
You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong
I'll be here, when hope is out of sight
I just wish that I was next to you tonight, and oh
I'll be reachin' for you even though
You'll be somewhere else, my love will go
Like a bird, on it's way back home
I could never let you go, that I just want you to know...
I can wait forever, if you say you'll be there, too
I can wait forever, if you will, I know it's worth it all

Where are you know?
Alone, with the thoughts we share
Keep them strong somehow
And you know, I'll always be there...

150,The Style Council,My Ever Changing Moods,TRBGZEQ128F147A63D,1984,"Daylight turns to moonlight - and I'm at my best
Praising the way it all works - gazing upon the rest
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm
I wish to stay forever - letting this be my food
But I'm caught up in a whirlwind and my ever changing moods
Bitter turns to sugar - some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet - for me won't be too soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
I wish we'd move together - this time the bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children - who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through - another's evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
I wish we'd wake up one day - an' everyone feel moved
But we're caught up in the dailies and an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues
and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge
the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late
I wish we'd come to our senses and see there is no truth
In those who promote the confusion for this ever changing mood"

Without your love it's a melody played in a penny arcade

What goes on inside of you
In the cathedral of the mind
All the worshippers are blind
Like a toilet from outside
A cathedral from inside
There behind your open face
Lies an awful lot of space
And if I ever look into your open eyes again
I'll remind myself to stare until I'm looking through your eyes
When I'm hurt you feel the pain
You've been in my head again
You're projecting onto me

They don't know who picks me up when no one is around
I drop my sword and cry for just a while
'Cause deep inside this armor
The warrior is a child

Unafraid because His armor is the best
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest
People say that I'm amazing
Never face retreat
But they don't see the enemies
That lay me at His feet

They don't know that I go running home when I fall down
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around

Nowhere soon
Tomorrow you'll pick up the Sports Page, the Financial News
What escapes your attention is easily read
You look like you, think you'd be better off dead
 
But you, you're always fallin' apart
It was just too easy to break your heart
 
What's been paid for in misery's
Been brought back with luck
I ache for the truth like you
Break from my touch
The mirror I'm watchin' won't
Tell what to say, or how to
Explain that I'm going away
In a palace of lights that dim on command
The wind machine works to cool me again
From the top of the building, six flights up
I watched an impotent city, go up and you
 
You're always fallin' apart
It was just too easy to break your heart
It's just too easy to break your heart

I don't raise the shades
On the day that I'm leaving you
I don't wash the face that will say goodbye
I won't write a letter, I didn't meet you that way

To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style

If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

Ive done all to be done 
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise, 
Shall follow the feel of constant care) 

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...

He's watching your pussy, he will his food
And when he arised you think it's a lover
But he likes strange practices, you'll discover

You lie on your bed,
You view real seems great
But instead of his prick
He's drawing his blade

That you couldn't stand it

Gives sight to the blind
Transforms himself
He's not of our kind

He knows not that he's been defied

Demon lords won't you ride with me
Mount your horse to Gethsemane

Judas Iscariot, money man and thief of Judah
Tell me haven't you dined with the man
And preached with him in Galilee
You deny being one of the twelve
Wish to trade your king for gold
Thirty silver pieces be your reward
And may your rotten conscience never grow old

I am in you, you are in I
You have defied me
I see through your eyes
Beware the kiss of death

Pharisees I fall to my knees
We must nullify the contract we have made
I have pined, defied innocent blood
And returned the silver pieces that you've paid
What's this you say, who is he to us
See to thyself you greedy man
The place of the skull
In where lies your king
We have washed our hands"

One day you'll understand why Too late to give it a try
Back at home they wonder why I never call
Now we're through with it all
One day when everything's out of the way
Only the memories stay
We'll both be wondering who, when or where
But we don't really care, then we'll wonder
One day you'll realize why Just when you've given up trying
One day you're gonna go back to the place
Check it out just in case, and you'll wonder

She beat me up and left me out in the pouring rain
Without no keys without no reason to go back again
She left me empty-handed she left me empty-hearted
Not no money not nothing but the blues

All because of Patience
I get the pressures of life 
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love

She said the one thing that she needs is happiness
I don't believe that she's happy until she sees that I'm in distress
No...all because of Patience
I get the pressures of life 
Through lack of Patience
I get the pressures of love
...and I swoon"

Your so called friends, they're trying to break us up
They say that I'm cheating on you, that I can't allow

It won't take a minute to talk it out, I'll make you believe me somehow

There ain't a woman like you in the world baby
Can do what you do, thrill me like you do
There ain't a woman in the world, can start such a fire the way that you do
There ain't a woman like you, there ain't a woman like you, no
There ain't a woman like you, there ain't a woman like you

No use pretending to you, you know I've been around
Won't be no more lying lady, all that's in the past

You ain't the first girl I really loved, but you'll be the last

There ain't a woman like you in the world baby
Can do what you do, thrill me like you do
There ain't a woman in the world, can start such a fire the way that you do
There ain't a woman like you, there ain't a woman like you, no

169,Sheila E,The Belle Of St. Mark  (LP Version),TRUNXTJ128F1473AB8,1984,"The belle of St. Mark was a frail but a passionate creature
Ebony hair and eyes a deep blue-green
The belle of St. Mark wore clothes that belonged to his father
Even though he was only 17

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

You can tell from expressions that he makes public
That he suffers from a badly broken heart
He smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons
But he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

The belle of St. Mark, he don't talk to strangers, he's so mysterious
His erotic persuasion provokes me like no other man
The fire I have for him is undoubtedly serious
I need to make him see that he needs love to forget
And if anyone can help him, I can
I can help, I can help you

His Paris hair, it blows in the warm Parisian air
That blows whenever his Paris hair is there
The woman that hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping
'Cause the belle of St. Mark is a beauty extraordinaire

Oh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die
And if he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die
And if he don't, I'll die"

And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
Is all of heaven away

Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade

A race is on, I'm on your side
And here in you, my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
Or running away
Stars come down in you
And love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
You can't give it away

Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade

Don't you go, it makes no sense
When all your talk and supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain?
And love (love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
Is only heaven away

Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade
The ghost in you, she don't fade
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade

And you fell on the floor
With your hand on the knob
Looking up and abruptly
Forget what you're thinking
Fire alarms go off in your head
You live

In the nightgown of the sullen moon
How the windows lean into the room
In the nightgown of the sullen moon

Drug trip, it's not a drug trip so you feel a bit insulted
Space walk, it's like a space walk with the corresponding weight loss
And you're nothing but air, with your hand in the air
And your shoelaces tied up together with care
There's a feeling of boredom
Of the big whoredom
Following dressing up

In the nightgown of the sullen moon
How the windows lean into the room
In the nightgown of the sullen moon

In the nightgown of the sullen moon
How the windows lean into the room
In the nightgown of the sullen moon

Forever is a long time

If you tear yourself in two again,
If I could, yes I would
If I could, I would let it go.
Surrender, dislocate.

If I could throw this lifeless life-line to the wind,
Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night, and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame.

If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day.

To let it go and so to fade away.
To let it go and so fade away.
I'm wide awake.
I'm wide awake, wide awake.
I'm not sleeping.

If you should ask, then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Bruised silken sky and burning flak.
Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes.

If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go.

This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation
Let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so to fade away

I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake, wide awake,
I'm not sleeping
Oh no, no, no."

Time on my side
I got it all
I heard that pride
Always comes before a fall
There's a rumour goin' 'round the town
That you don't want me around
I can't shake off my city blues
Everywhere I turn, I lose

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die

You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die

Time is no healer
If you're not there
Lonely fever
Sad words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

174,Bruce Springsteen,Working On The Highway,TRAUJTZ12903CF7BB4,1984,"Friday night's pay night, guys fresh out of work
Talking 'bout the weekend, scrubbing off the dirt
Some heading home to their families, some are looking to get hurt
Some going down to Stovell wearing trouble on their shirts

I work for the county out on 95
All day I hold a red flag and watch the traffic pass me by
In my head I keep a picture of a pretty little miss
Someday mister, I'm gonna lead a better life than this

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I met her at a dance down at the union hall
She was standing with her brothers, back up against the wall
Sometimes we'd go walking down the union tracks
One day I looked straight at her and she looked straight back

So I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

I saved up my money and I put it all away
I went to see her daddy but we didn't have much to say
""Son, can't you see that she's just a little girl?
She don't know nothing about this cruel, cruel world""

We lit out down to Florida, we got along alright
One day her brothers came and got her and they took me in a black and white
The prosecutor kept the promise that he made on that day
And the judge got mad and he put me straight away

I wake up every morning to the work bell clang
Me and the warden go swinging on the Charlotte County road gang

I'm working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway

Working on the highway, laying down the blacktop
Working on the highway, all day long I don't stop
Working on the highway, blasting through the bedrock
Working on the highway, working on the highway"

I want to lay my heart on the line
It's no infatuation

There's no need to fear
We can let our hearts collide
Attraction, reaction

Will I lose control

I just go crazy
'Cause I love you too much
'Cause I'm mad about you
You got to know
And you save me
You just amaze me
When I think of your touch
I go crazy
'Cause I'm bad without you, ooh
I go crazy

'Cause I love you too much
I go crazy
'Cause I'm mad without you
Will I love you more

I imagine you into my future
You and I in love
Making dreams come true of us together
Girl, it makes me nervous
'Cause I know you're not my very own, not just yet

I say leave
When I mean stay

And so she moves away
What we really want
You know we rarely say
Such is the language of love

It's tooth for tooth
And eye for eye
We hide our hearts
And then we won't say why
It's truth for truth
And lie for lie
Such is the language of love

One cries foul
And will not speak
The other claims a little victory
And all the time
You know we fail to see
This is the language of love

When a loves begins to wander
No one ever knows
But we feel it deep inside us
Long before it shows
Long before it shows

We hem and haw
We balk and bluff
Our words don't ever 
Seem to say enough
But a simple smile
A tender touch
Speaks the true language of love

When a loves begins to wander
No one ever knows
But we feel it deep inside us
Long before it shows
Long before it shows

I watched the tall ships go
With the drift wood on the flow
With pride that grows in hardship
And I knew you were below

I hear your voice
And it keeps me from sleeping
Why must it always be dreams
When your voice comes to me

I dreamed you felt the typhoon spit
And walked into the heart of it
While the seagulls cry
I know how to feel that call
It never suited me at all
But some are born to it
And you seemed so bright and hard
Like a bloody edge of sword
But if you're an enemy
Then you look a lot like me

I hear your voice
And it keeps me from sleeping
Why must it always be dreams
When your voice comes to me

I dreamed you sailed me to the swamp
In a black boat
You spoke to me of things
Of the shame that years will bring
And I felt your hand shake
Though you always seemed so hard
Now I never see the sword
And I find the enemy
Has to feel the same as me

Run with the blind but just keep in mind
Your symbols are the symbols of aggression
Run with the pack there's no turning back
The call of fools is no exception
Hell is just a flutter away in the heart of your passion play
You're so dramatic 

Following your guiding light
To the fine and deadly fight
Who will turn the day to night
Must everybody suffer for your lack of sight

To mutually assured destruction
Run with the herd the crazed the absurd
Blindly follow your instructions

I really did't think you'd go

Because today
I could have sworn I heard you say
I love you 
I want you
I need to be with you
Today
I saw something in your face

Stay here
Beside me
I need your love to hide me
You lied
And now you've gone away
And left me crying like a baby"

Nostalgia burns in the hearts of the strongest

The wind and sails
These are years with a genius for living

The rope is cut, the rabbit is loose

The blood of a poet, the ink in the well
(It's all written down in this age of reason)

The animals run through harvested fields of fire
The bitterness shown on the face of the homeless
Picasso is painting the flames from the houses
The sudden rain

Yesterday ain't gone

Out in the jungle

There's a different smile on your face today
Though you wear it well
There's a lot to say
There's a different mood in the world tonight
We can do it right

John he washed it over with a confidence tan
I know that peace and love ain't prevention

Build them up it's so sad they forget you

Don't wanna end up digging holes in the road

Everywhere we go they shout you got a chip on your shoulder
A chip on your shoulder

I'm gonna shout gonna scream don't wanna job too soon
I wanna fight on a Saturday afternoon
Runnin' riot might as well
Me little brother gone and joined the T.C.L.

A messenger comes with the beating of drums
It's not a message of love

Our children are born, and we keep them warm
They must have the right to live in the light
To be safe from the storm

Out of the blue, with wings on his heels
A messenger comes bearing regrets
For the time that he steals

But steal it he will, my children's and mine
Against our desires, against all our needs
Our blood spilled like wine

Over and over we call . . . no one hears
And further and further and further we fall
And though we pray that we soon will awake
It is clear, that it's no dream at all
Our lives are at stake

I cannot believe, nor even pretend
That the thunder I hear will just disappear
And the nightmare will end

So hold back the fire 'cause this much is true
When all's said and done, the ending will come
From out of the blue"

Fino alla strada e poi ancora più giù
Scappati dopo aver mangiato spaghetti

Yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well, when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me, an' you told me boldly
That someday, well, I'll be blue

Well, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes, that'll be the day when you make me cry
You say you gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

con il cielo, con gli occhi

vorrei rapire il freddo
in un giorno di sole
che potrebbe tornare in un attimo solo.

Forse stanotte,
se avro' attraversato
la strada che non posso vedere
poi in un momento
copriro' le distanze
per raggiungere il fuoco
vivo sotto la neve.

I nostri occhi impauriti
nelle stanze gelate,
al chiarore del petrolio bruciato
e oltre il muro il silenzio,
oltre il muro solo ghiaccio e silenzio.

Aspettero' questa notte pensandoti,
nascondendo nella neve il respiro,

It brought back the memories of feelings we once knew
My senses played tricks on me, for we're long overdue
I know what the reason is; I want you

We met very casually, or so it seemed
Our light conversation was a part of Cupid's scheme
One dance in the full moonlight, one touch of a dream
I know what this feeling is; I want you

Come go away with me and wrap me in desire
Draw unto me, my dear, and then put out the fire
Let's go to the land of love, watch the sunrise draw nigh
Yes, I know what this yearning is; I want you"

Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday
And this is where the cowboy rides away

We've been in and out of love and in-between
And now we play the final show-down scene
And as the credits roll a sad song starts to play

For a good time tonight

You get 'em once and they fall at your knees
I wish that I would've known better
Before I played the dirty deed

And chain them to reality

218,Rez Band,Wendi's Rap,TRZXCPF128F4278376,1984,"(I'd like to tell you a story about a little girl. She was a happy little girl. She would wake up each morning, just kind of excited to be alive and wondering what great thing would happen that day. She had a lot of love and trust. She had that real spark of childlike innocence and faith. She was four...not quite five. She had a brother and a sister, they were younger. She had a mother whom she dearly loved and dad who was really struggling with alcoholism. In one day, in this child's world, it just came to an abrupt change. This little girl's mother woke up blind in one of her eyes. It was a freak virus. No one knew why, but it was terrifying. She didn't know if it was going to attack the other eye or what was going to happen. She was looking for a miracle; she was desperate, she wanted to keep her family together. She went into the hospital looking for a healing, and the three children went off to the grandparents. Now this seemed like a very good idea for the little girl; the grandfather was a pastor in a small, Southern town, a respected man in his community. But there was something about him that a lot of people didn't know, and that was the fact that he was a child molester. And within that time, while her mother was in the hospital, the little girl went through unspeakable horrors...and that childlike light, that innocence, that trust, that faith, it was stomped on, and it was gone. Now I know about that, because I was that little girl.

My mother, she got her sight back, and we were reunited as a family...but I was never the same. I was angry, I wondered why, wondered what I had done wrong. By the time I was a teenager, I was just a bubbling cauldron of emotions, getting ready to erupt. I lived like a crazy person; I didn't care what happened. I'd use a person, they'd use me - hey, it didn't matter; what was love? And right around my eighteenth birthday, my sister invited me to come to this coffee house and...it's kind of a rock club. And there was this group playing on the stage, and they were playing, you know, some good music; it was my kind of music. But it was very weird because they were talking about God. And, in between the songs, this man got up and he said that no matter what you've done, no matter what has been done to you, you can be like a little child again.

It was like an arrow piecing my heart. I started to get all shook up, and I thought, ""I'm gonna cry in front of these people, I gotta get out of here."" I went and I hid in the ladies bathroom. I thought, ""Hey, I'll get a big drink of water, I'll swallow the big lump in my throat, and I'll leave here."" But, as I walked out, someone touched me on the shoulder and they asked me...they said, ""Do you want to pray?"". I didn't know if I could trust God, but I took a chance; I didn't have anything to lose, and I desperately wanted to be a new person. I wanted to be that little child again. So, that night I trusted Jesus Christ with my problems, my fears, my hurts. And every night we do a concert, I know that Jesus Christ is piercing someone's heart...and his love is right there for you.)"

You and I have been together
For so many years
If love is right, why do you fight
To hold back needless tears

Tell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night

Bring your pretty head just closer
Get it close to mine
Your eyes are saying something
But the words are hard to find

Love don't know it lasts forever
Ours is here to stay
After all the love we've given
Please don't look at me that way

Tell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night

Feelings come and hearts fall broken
Slipping through our hands
The ways of life and love
I'll never never understand

If it's true what you've been saying
If there's still a chance
Why is it that the two of us
Can't rescue this romance

Faded love don't ever come back
So the story goes
There is a side of you and I
Where love no longer goes

Tell me babe, it'll be alright
But when I'm deep inside I realize
That this our last night"

That all you need is money
To be free from what is poor
Well that's the lie of looking up
From somewhere down

Because the sun will show to testify
That all the time between belongs to you and I
To be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused
To be still on fire

Somewhere in the middle
We could see through all the people
And be playing second fiddle
And be feeling sore
Shown the door
To chase out all the child in you
Is throwing out the baby for the
Chance to make it easy to be more

Because the sun will show to testify
That all the time between belongs to you and I
To be still on fire
And when the strongest words have all been used
And all the new ones sound confused

The thoughts you've locked away
When tomorrow comes you'll wish
You had today 

And as we sit here alone
Looking for a reason to go on
It's so clear that all we have now
Are our thoughts of yesterday

If you're still there when it's all over
I'm scared I'll have to say
That a part of you has gone
Since yesterday

And as we sit here alone
Looking for a reason to go on
It's so clear that all we have now
Are our thoughts of yesterday

Well, maybe this could be the ending
With nothing left of you
A hundred wishes couldn't say
I don't want to 

And as we sit here alone
Looking for a reason to go on
It's so clear that all we have now
Are our thoughts of yesterday

It's so clear that all we have now
Are thoughts of yesterday"

We're living in a different reality
We're toeing the same line
We give in we call it neutrality,
A joke with no punchline
The silver plated hero
Meets the golden hearted whore
The odds'll give you zero
She'll be leaving in a few days more
Movin' on forever, maybe she don't care
Holding on together, maybe it just ain't there

You're dancing on a high wire
You need to be so sure
There used to be a lifeline
There isn't anymore

We are the same with no similarity,
We talk at the same time
We believe in freedom and charity
As long as I get mine
The ivory madonna is walking
Through the door
You watch her from a window,
It doesn't matter anymore
Moving on forever, maybe she don't care
Holding on together, maybe it just ain't there

You're dancing on a high wire
You need to be so sure
There used to be a life-line
There isn't anymore"

Exanimate a penance
Not fit for man nor beast
Innocent of mortal sin
Do hear me out at least

Man of strong mind and soul
Deserves a second chance
Just to see a glimpse of light
Would warm my icy hands

Any kin or family
Just an echo in my mind
Silence loudens tribulations
That I left behind
Just then a beam of light projects
From underneath the rock
Could it be escape I'm free
I'll dig my fingers raw

Deep in your mind look for the answer
It'll be there
Life, strange illusion
Stay low, I'll take care
Time is the sentence in which
You must abide
Make sin your companion
Then Satan be your bride

The tunnels deep and twisting
As I press my body through
Entrapped in this one way passage
The light I must pursue
I grasp the bars at the end of my crawl
As I gape down to the sea
The skeleton of a man who tried
A fool just like me"

In a spaceship over the mountains
Chasing rainbows in the setting sun
Leaving heart and home for the city of angels
I feel my life is undone

There are pathways winding below me
In pleasure I've gone where they go
In the quiet stillness I can hear symphonies
The loveliest music I know

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again

Oh, it's been a long time since I've listened
Still longer since I've walked with you
For the first time I know what I'm missing
Some answers are no longer true

So I question the course that I follow
I'm doubtful and deep in despair
My heart is filled with impossible notions
Can it be you no longer care?

Still, I ride on the wings of a high wind
Blowing steady and strong behind me
As the clouds surrender my fate is for certain
I'm a sailor who runs to the sea

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again"

I see time is a lover
I feel her slip away

Count them one by one
Seconds rolling round your heart, they tick away
Growin' old in style
She's the child who makes the world keep waiting
For a better place
Runnin' out of space

She never stays

Watch her slip away

You start ignoring the fears I have felt
'Cause you know you can always make my poor heart melt

Please don't take what I'm saying amiss
Or misunderstand at a time such as this
Because if such close friends should ever fall out
What would there be left worth fighting about

Power and glory, justice and right
I'm sure that you'll help them to see the light
Will you save our children, will you save our land
And protect us from all the things we can't understand?
Power and glory and justice for all
Who will we turn to when your hard rain falls?"

Wipe the tears and find the things that she needs to get along

But it's with your heart you're searching all the time 

I want you with me

I want so much from you anew 

The dreams we had were rather common line 
And in their wake there came the fear you'd changed your mind

Y jugaste con mas hombres sin tener piedad
Tu fría mirada y en tus ojos sangre.....
Sangre, sangre.... de diablo.....

Han pasado muchos años desde la ultima vez

Reynard left and went to Warwickshire, to a mound near a railway line,
with canals and a freezing swamp. He climbs high up above the countryside
and breathes freely. To the south he could see Polesworth, and to the
north he could just make out the ruins of the priory where Joss and I
played cricket as children. We were only three miles away, probably drinking
tea and talking,

(Have you heard about the orphan, sitting by the coffin)

at the same time as he was taking the stanley knife out of
the bag. He pushed the point into his stomach,

(His Father's not a sinner no more)

until the light shone right
through. And then he reached down, and he took the bag.
It's a plastic bag
With plastic handles
And plastic sides

The time is short, is running low
On the river's surface, appears a mill
It sunk a long, long time ago

The old, lame miller goes ashore
I know what he's searching for

Death, pain,agony
Famin is spread all through the land
Death, pain,agony
The white fog is carried by the air

Pale, bony fingers search through the fields
They scratch out nourishing seed
The wicked miller fills his bags
With all the stolen winter wheat

He grinds the corn and flour fills the air
Flour turns to fog bringing hunger and dispair

Death, pain,agony....

Everytime when this fog appears
There'll be no harvest only hunger and tears

Death, pain, agony...."

Ow

I like the way she walks
I like the way she talks
she turns me on with a special concern
now I'm a different guy
and I don't compare to many
but next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
that surrounds the girl wherever in the world
she's a 9, a 10 a 25th
she's bittersweet and .....

She's strange
and I like it

Just the way she is
Strange
Walking down the avenue
She's strange
Always doing something new

She's the kind of person everybody knows
She reeks distinction from head to toe
She's my twilight zone, my Al Capone
She's my rolling stones and my Ava Perone

And I like it
Yes I like it
I like it
The way she wears her hair
And I like it
Oh oh
I like it

In room 123, she elusive you see, like the invisible man in drag,
and when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her, she'll be waving her skirt as a flag,
Like the cold in October she'll take you right over,
It's not mean to be facetious
and that look in her eye says your the guy she plans to spend this evening with

She's strange

So many times I'm tempted to ask You why,
But I can never forget it for long.
Lord, what You do could not be wrong.
So I believe You, even when I must cry.

Chorus:
Do I trust You, Lord?
Does the river flow?
Do I trust You, Lord?
Does the north wind blow?
You can see my heart,
You can read my mind,
And You got to know
That I would rather die
Than to lose my faith
In the One I love.
Do I trust You, Lord?
Do I trust You?

I know the answers, I've given them all.
But suddenly now, I feel so small.
Shaken down to the cavity in my soul.
I know the doctrine and theology,
But right now they don't mean much to me.
This time there's only one thing I've got to know.

Chorus:
Do I trust You, Lord?
Does the robin sing?
Do I trust You, Lord?
Does it rain in spring?
You can see my heart,
You can read my mind,
And You got to know
That I would rather die
Than to lose my faith
In the One I love.
Do I trust You, Lord?
Do I trust You?

I will trust You, Lord, when I don't know why.
I will trust You, Lord, till the day I die.
I will trust You, Lord, when I'm blind with pain!
You were God before, and You'll never change.
I will trust You.
I will trust You.
I will trust You, Lord.

Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life
Larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and it's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone, somewhere, watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light

280,Joe Cocker,Tempted,TRVJKXP128F1456F7E,1984,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pyjamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place
Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all
I know I will

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
I'm wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell

At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop

I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do"

That I was so alone

And without one word
I could tell what was gonna happen
I could feel it in my bones

By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
She took me to her room
Oh, ya know it felt so right

The heat's growin' higher
The flame of desire
By the dark of the moon
Oh, there's a fire in the night

When she told me
She didn't often do this kind of thing
She said please hold me
Hold me tight so I don't have to think

Oh, her gentle touch
Really moved me so much
The flames of love swept over us
Like a burning light

So I took control and decided to teach
I wanna teach highschool!

I tell the little buggers what to wear
I show 'em how to set and dye their hair
There'll be no costumes at our swimming pool
There'll be no ugly girls at my highschool

Must stay in class all night, and practice their biology

When you go down on your knees
You're so hard down on Mission Street

Will you always be the one who won't look back?

It feels like up down on Mission Street

Your lips are cold as stone
She picked you up and you put her down
And messed her place around

Only the castle itself can tell what it keeps
Dark are the secrets between these walls
Hidden in shadows of death, while the sorcerer sleeps

Where is the morning
Where is the sun
Thousand years of midnight
The sunrise is gone

An old man marked by a life so long
Is sleeping so sweet while his magic is growing so strong
Waiting still for new times to come
A thousands years to see if he has won

Where is the morning
Where is the sun
A thousand years of midnight

The sunrise is gone
I
What has he done?
Why is he sleeping so long?
He wants to live for evermore

Soon is he young
And will he open his eyes?
When he is strong enough to rule

Back in our time goes the legend
Of a sorcerer so old
He drank the blood of the virgin to be reborn

Soon a tyrant will conquer
So spoke the wise
Of the day when the sorcerer will rise

Blood is his wine
The sorcerer is cheating on time
And he'll be stronger than before

Cursed be the sun
The women will weep for his fun
In the name of his magic so strong

A thousand years have gone
Armageddon hasn't come
Only the cry of a child echoes in the dark
Wards goes time
As the stars are passing by
And nothing remains of this foolishman except his fate"

Fifteen times I try this
And every time I faint
You look at me and
Start to tell the joke
About the man who couldn't stop
Hiccupping...

Wearing big diamond rings and silk suits.

Man I don't mean a Hampstead nursery.
But when you own a big chunk of the bloody third world,
The babies just come with the scenery.

Stasera niente male, è sera
Luna piena sul tuo viso

Come frecce nel buio
Cicche spente da quattro passi

Che belle, le tue labbra che belle
... ma nessuno lo sa!

Ya se siente la atmósfera
Saturada de aburrimiento
Los hippies y los punk tuvieron la ocasión
De romper el estancamiento
En las garras de la comercialización

Las juventudes cacarearon bastante
Y no convencen ni por solo un instante
Pidieron comprensión, amor y paz
Con frases hechas muchos años atrás

Agudiza tus sentidos date cuenta que estás vivo

La gente de tu edad no sabe que hacer

Eres actor principal
De las entrañas de nuestras ciudades
Surge la piel que vestirá al mundo

Ya viene la fuerza

Ya viene la fuerza
La voz de los ochenta

Escucha el murmullo, algo se siente venir
Los últimos vientos de los setentas se mueren
Mira nuestra juventud, que alegría mas triste y falsa

Deja la inercia de los setentas abre los ojos ponte de pie

Agudiza tus sentidos date cuenta que estás vivo

It's no mystery
Acting in school at the tenderest age
Lit up the room when she stepped on the stage
Came to LA for some more
She's the face on the cutting room floor

She had visions of contracts
And thousands of people in line
To see her;
Knocking on door after door after all of this time,
Now she's not sure

Up in Hollywood
Stayed with an agent she met in a bar
Laughed when he told her he'd make her a star
Where had she heard that before? 
She's the face on the cutting room floor

One night he told her that she'd never get anywhere
In her clothes
That's what it takes to play movieland musical chairs
Now she knows

Goodbye Hollywood
Leaving tonight on the 2:30 'hound

I stopped at a roadside diner for a burger and a coke

There were some country folk and some hunters inside

I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song

They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside
and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside

Cortaré una lágrima con una gillette 
Y serán otras mis señales.

Correr implica apresurarse.

Reaping all that you've been sowing.

Climb the walls, so watch the corner
Climb the walls and watch the corner.

And I'm here today to tell you
That I savour every inch you put on paper.

Cutting you without a doubt.

Your time has come the full moon's in the air
Hear the cry of the jackal in the hills
Scent of smoke fills your nostrils
as the wind blows back your hair
Paint the canvas black if you will

Watch out there's a man who wants your soul
It won't be long till he finds you
Don't look back at the shadow on the wall
With hands outstretched to grab you
So don't let the reaper catch you sitting still. NO! 

Feel the touch on your shoulder as you turn your head around
Take heed, my friend, of the reaper's blade
Oh, come, you happy hearted, let your empty minds be filled
Don't let your hallowed soul be betrayed

Fix your eyes on the crowd, don't let your stare astray
See them practice magic in the air
As they cry their incantations, oh, their damned insinuations
Mix the sea with the blood moon, but beware

Blood moon sitting high up in the sky
Oh, you're the spotlight that can kill
Blood moon bleeding on the world tonight
It will take your heart and change your will

In some bus or train, traveling alone
In some motel room there'll be a radio playing
And you'll hear me sing this song

325,Elton John,Sad Songs (Say So Much),TRODNCQ128EF342E37,1984,"Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

So turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much

When all hope is gone
You know, sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When every little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When everything you do is going wrong
Sad songs say so much"

327,Boney M.,Going Back West,TRAFVHN128F428EEBF,1984,"I was born and raised in the ghetto
Talk with me and you'll know
I wasn't satisfied, with living on the side
I started looking around, for a possibility
Listen to my story, of what became of me

I met a businessman
Who said he had some friends back east
So why don't you come along
Well we can help you at least
We'll make you into a big star
By playing your guitar
But the joke was on me
They left me flat to see

Going back west
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back west
Where my music's playing all night
Going back west (going back west)
I think I'll do alright

Going back west
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back west
Where my music's playing all night
Going back west (going back west)
I think I'll do alright

Struggling for recognition, identity and respect
I got a lot of promises
They told me not to fret
So we will stand by you
If the going gets rough
But when I started thinking
They didn't even bluff

'bout a year has come and gone
And left me standing here
Thinking how it could have been
For still I ain't nowhere
They surely took me for a ride
Trampled on my pride
But I hold my head up high
Got no more tears to cry

Going back west
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back west
Where my music's playing all night
Going back west (going back west)
I think I'll do alright

Going back west
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back west
Where my music's playing all night
Going back west (going back west)
I think I'll do alright

Going back west
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back west
Where my music's playing all night"
328,Fad Gadget,Jump,TRFQVJJ128F1467F71,1984,"You tell yourself you're happy here
And never mind the cost
You hide beneath your shallow fear
Deny your life is lost
The tension starts to wear on you
Your mind's in disarray
The things you feel are out of time
With all the words you say

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you

Listen to what I say
I always have my way
When I say move, you move
When I say jump, you jump

Now all your hopes go dirty grey
Your love becomes a chore
You've watched it all just drift away
No surprises left in store
The window ledge is calling you
Your mind's in a disarray
The way out seems so simple now
In the cold, cold lift of day

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you

Listen to what I say
I always have my way
When I say move, you move
When I say jump, you jump

Jump, I said jump
So jump

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you
The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you
The world is rough and jagged
And it tears you up, it tears you up
The world is rough and jagged
And it tears you up, it tears you up"
329,Sisters Of Mercy,Marian,TRRGIJV128F930C330,1984,"In a sea of faces, in a sea of doubt
In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home.....

CHORUS
I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the 
Grave...
Marian 

Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me

CHORUS

Was ich kann und was ich könnte
(What I can do and what I could do)
Weiß ich gar nicht mehr
(I just don't know anymore)
Gib mir wieder etwas Schönes
(Give me something beautiful again) 
Zieh mich aus dem Meer
(Drag me from the sea)
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
(I hear you calling Marian)
Kannst du mich schreien hören
(Can you hear me calling?)
Ich bin hier allein
(I am here alone)
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
(I hear you calling Marian)
Ohne deine Hilfe verliere ich mich in diesem Ort
(Without your help I am lost in this place)

CHORUS
(repeat Marian til end)"
330,Nik Kershaw,Know How,TROTTVY128F14940B9,1984,"got a badge upon my chest
i'm a cut above the rest
so ican tell you what to do

got my regimental hat
got my ""by the good book"" chat
so ican tell you where to go

i've got a job to do and i'm telling you
i intend to do it well
it's easy when you know how

got my smart uniform
and my duty to perform
so i
don't care you who you are

i'm the only one who can spoil your fun
with one shake of the head

it's easy when youknow how, know way
know where and know today
know mercy, know time
know reason, know rhyme
know how

i can tell you i'm the law
with my medals from the war
so don't tell me what to do
with my narrow point of view

though i know you're probably right, i guess
it's still not easy saying yes
it's easy when you know how, know way
know where and know today
know mercy, know time
know reason, know rhyme

know how"
331,Romeo Void,Out On My Own,TRJCCWD128F426BA36,1984,"I was a girl who just couldn't say no
I would watch as they'd come and go
They didn't care if they left me cold
They didn't care if they left me out in the cold
Out on my Own

As the years went by I learned not to cry
I walked away with my head held high
I can remember when I thought it was good
And I remember when they left me it was for good
Out on my Own

I thought I knew what I wanted, thought I got what I needed
thought I knew what I wanted, thought I got what I needed
She knew what she wanted
She got what she needed

I was the girl who tore up the streets
House on the hill was not my dream
I was the one who had to run free
Had to run wild, nobody running with me
Out on my Own

I thought I knew what I wanted, thought I got what I needed
thought I knew what I wanted, thought I got what I needed
She knew what she wanted
She got what she needed."
332,Talking Heads,Take Me To The River (Live) (1999 Digital Remaster),TRHZOIY128F145F49D,1984,"I don't know why I love you like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
And I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know can you tell me
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down

Washing me
Hold me, squeeze me
Love me, tease me
'Til I can't, 'til I can't
'Til I can't, I can't take no more

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Push me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down

I don't know why I love you like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles blown on my wall
And am I the biggest fool of them all
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Drop me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down"
333,Steve Vai,You Didn't Break It,TROJVXG128F4265CD6,1984,"You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break my heart when you split
You only cracked it just a bit

Somethin's changed
Though I know my heart ain't plastic
I guess through the years it's grown
A little more elastic

'Cause this time cryin' time
Didn't last as long
And my heart just needed minor repairs
And it feels pretty strong
(Feels pretty strong)
And it's movin' right along

You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break my heart when you split
You only cracked it just a bit

You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break my heart

Losin' love, it used to crush me
Now it doesn't
I just figured it was meant to be
Or it wasn't

So if you wanna know
Now that you're gone, the shape I'm in
You never clipped the wings of my heart
It's gonna fly again.

You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break my heart when you split
You only cracked it just a bit

You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break it
You didn't break my heart

I got somethin' that keeps me goin'
I got a habit of comin' around, honey
You didn't run me off the highway
You only slowed me down"

Never let me down
And I smile
Whenever you're around

Ooh and I've got a feeling
It'll work out right
Can't stop thinking about you
Every day and night 

Ooh, I got a love (I got somebody)
This love (got a hold on me)
Yeah, I got a love (I got somebody)
This love (got a hold on me)

Well, I've been in love
And I've lost
I can count the tears
But I can't count the cost

Oh, I've been down
I've been used
Now I know, I know, I know
That I just can't lose

Ooh, I got a love (I got somebody)
