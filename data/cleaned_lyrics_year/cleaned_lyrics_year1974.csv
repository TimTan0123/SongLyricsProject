0,Leroy Hutson,Give This Love A Try,TRKZFOD128F1473B75,1974,"You are my everything
My summer, my winter
Fall and the spring

For you, I'll surely try
Cause you make me pull the love inside

So give this love a try girl
Let me tell you why, girl
Cause youre the one that I've been waiting for

So think it over, don't be rash
Don't let this let this good love pass
Why won't you give me a try

You love me, you know I love you
And every hour, that undying love I'll brew

I'll never, never make you cry
And the good times
And the bad times
I'll be standing by

So, give this love a try girl
Let me tell you why, girl
'cause youre the one that I've been waiting for

So, think it over, don't be rash
Don't let this let this good love pass
Why won't you give me a try

So, think it over, don't be rash
Don't let this let this good love pass
Why won't you give me a try

Whoo (So give this love a try girl
Let me tell you why, girl
Cause youre the one that I've been waiting for)
You oughta think it over (So give this love a try girl
Let me tell you why, girl
Cause youre the one that I've been waiting for)
Love, Love, Love
You oughta Give this love a try"
1,Argent,Thunder And Lightning,TRMWHGM128F9341D87,1974,"There are times when you feel so good
That the only way to move is down
You're feeling fine, looking like a king
Then you turn around and you're painted like a clown.

Nights you feel you're about to win
The gold in your pocket turns to tin.

Thunder, lightning, striking again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

You play the game and you just can't lose
And you're walking with your feet off the ground
Every ball seems to hit the net
Every penny that you save becomes a pound.

Just when you find peace of mind
Just look around and what do you find?

Thunder (thunder, thunder, thunder) lightning (lightning, lightning, lightning)
Striking (striking, striking, striking) again and again and again and again 
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

Well you play the game and you just can't lose
And you're walking with your feet off the ground
Every ball seems to hit the net
Every penny that you save becomes a pound.

Just when you find peace of mind
Just look around and what do you find ?

Thunder (thunder, thunder, thunder) lightning (lightning, lightning, lightning)
Striking (striking, striking, striking)  again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down.

Thunder (thunder, thunder, thunder) lightning (lightning, lightning, lightning)
Striking (striking, striking, striking)  again and again and again and again
Thunder and lightning striking me down."
2,George McCrae,I Get Lifted,TRVTCRA128F429F027,1974,"Sittin' here together, baby we're all alone
Now I can tell ya, girl, you turn me on
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Bring out the lovin', lovin' desire, baby
You got the match, oh that lights the fire
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Mama-mama, mama-mama
Mama-mama, mama-mama

I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high - hi-high

Mama-mama, mama-mama
Mama-mama, mama-mama

Sittin' on the corner, waiting for your love light..."
3,Dan Fogelberg,There's A Place In The World For A Gambler,TRTYRYF128F931D470,1974,"There's a place in the world
For a gambler
There's a burden that only
He can bear
There's a place in the world
For a gambler,

And he sees
Oh, yes he sees...
And he sees
Oh, yes he sees...

There's a song in the heart
Of a woman
That only the truest of loves
Can release.
There's a song in the heart
Of a woman.

Set it free
Oh, set it free
Set it free
Oh, set it free
Set it free
Oh, set it free.

There's a light in the depths
Of your darkness
There's a calm at the eye
Of every storm.
There's a light in the depths
Of your darkness.

Let is shine
Oh, let it shine
Let is shine
Oh, let it shine
Let is shine
Oh, let it shine.

Let it Shine"
4,Bob Dylan,Forever Young,TRQNYMS128F426A501,1974,"May God bless and keep you always,
May your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others
And let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

May you grow up to be righteous,
May you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you.
May you always be courageous,
Stand upright and be strong,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.

May your hands always be busy,
May your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young."
5,Barclay James Harvest,Paper Wings,TRYFNQU128F4238316,1974,"His crazy frame against the dawn
His hungry leap and ragged fall
A suicidal perch is now laid bare
To searching eyes and empty stares 
A fearful silence hits the crowd
The air hangs heavy with the sound
Of useless wings against the morning sky
As paper yields before their eyes 

Oh, can you see him now?
A broken man without a dream
Oh, can you hear him now?
A futile laugh above the screams"

8,Mott The Hoople,Walking With A Mountain,TRDCDEH12903CB152E,1974,"A mountain train's coming down the track
She ain't wasting time
She's carrying me cause I'm going back
Right to the Delaware line
She knows well I ain't been anywhere
Because I crawl back every time to her
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain

Troubles and tears
I'll take it in years
I left so many behind
I may be a train rearranged
Who knows what I'll find
But everything's better in my life I know
I can face any grades that I'm on
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
(alright)
(hey hey hey)

(oh) I'm walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
When she talks to me I know she sees
Where I'm heading to
She sits winks takes it all in
Just admires the view
And if I had a choice in life
I'd take that mountain for my wife
I'm walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain
Walkin' with a mountain

9,Mac Davis,Stop And Smell The Roses,TRUCINT128F4267CA0,1974,"Hey Mister
Where you going in such a hurry
Don't you think it's time you realized
There's a whole lot more to life than work and worry
The sweetest things in life are free
And there right before your eyes
You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way
Before you went to work this morning in the city
Did you spent some time with your family
Did you kiss your wife and tell her that she's pretty
Did you take your children to your breast and love them tenderly
You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way
Did you ever take a walk through the forest
Stop and dream a while among the trees
Well you can look up through the leaves right straight to heaven
You can almost hear the voice of God
In each any every breeze
You got to Stop and Smell the Roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the Roses along the way
You got to Stop and Smell the roses
You've got to count your many blessings everyday
You're gonna find your way to heaven is a rough and rocky road
If you don't Stop and Smell the roses along the way"
10,Uriah Heep,So Tired,TRJTSRI12903CB26E2,1974,"Well, I've been on the road
For a year or more
And I've done a lot of things
I never did before
Now I want everyone
To listen to my song
And you can tell me
When you've heard it
If you think I'm wrong

'cause I'm so tired
Of everybody staring at me
Yes, I'm so tired
And I'm so uninspired
Please help me

Well I've seen 'em rise
And I've seen 'em fall
And I use to think that
I was having a ball
But I was kiddin' myself
For a long long time
But now I got myself a spoon


And I'm feeling fine

But I'm so tired
Of everybody staring at me
Yes, I'm so tired
And I'm so uninspired
Won't you please help me

Where can you go
Where can you go
When there is no one
To show a guiding light
What did you say
What did you say
Have you been thinking about me
Day and night

'cause I'm so tired
Of everybody staring at me
And I'm so, so tired
I'm so uninspired
Please help me
Won't you please me ..."
11,Otis Rush,All Your Love,TRHLLPW12903CE64CD,1974,"All your love I miss lovin'
All you kisses I miss kissin'
All your love I miss lovin'
All your kisses I miss kissin'
Since I met you, baby
I never knew what I was missin'

All your love, pretty baby
That I got in store for you
All your love, pretty baby
That I got in store for you
When I tell ya, pretty baby
Ya gotta say you love me, too

All your lovin', pretty baby
All your lovin', pretty baby
All your lovin', pretty baby
All your lovin', pretty baby
When I first met ya, baby
I never knew what I was missin'"
12,Tim Buckley,Down in the Street,TRDFPEZ128F934569A,1974,"Down in the street
There's a gunshot warnin'
Here comes that blue parade
Ready to save the day;
Down in the street
There's a whole block burning
Shout out for rent control
I ride the gang patrol;
Oh it's just another sign
That summer's comin',
City wars and flash floods and tornados,
Festivals for rock and roll season
Beach talk baseball and a handy houshold hymns;

Yes it's true in the U.S. of A.
There's lots of room at the top,
Oh but you can't sit down,
On, no you can't sit down
And don't you know that boudoir
Looks just a ball and chain
Oh, no you can't sit down

All through the night
You hear gunshot warnings
This time it wasn't you,
Paid your dues;

All through the night
You hear the city moaning
But be a tomcat prowling
Baby, your stomach's growling;
Oh, it's just another sign 
That summer's comin',
City wars and flash floods and tornados,
Festivals for rock and roll season
Beach talk baseball and a handy household hymns;"
13,Thin Lizzy,It's Only Money,TRIZEGI128F428102D,1974,"You don't believe in love
You don't believe in hatred
Put your money in the bank
It's the only way to save it

You try to make a buck
But you haven't made a penny
You need a little luck
But you know you won't get any

You don't believe in God
You don't believe in glory
You've got a brother in the clinic
Tells the same kind of story

If he had another life
You'd know what would be waiting
If you had another soul
He could sell it all to Satan

It's only money
It's only money
It's only money

You don't believe in war
You don't believe in Jesus
Got a sister in New York
You know how she pleases

Walking the streets
On the south side of the city
Trying to make ends meet
Isn't that a pity

For money"
14,Uriah Heep,The Easy Road,TRLUNET128F9308DEB,1974,"If you're looking for a place
You can fly together
And you're really afraid of
What you're leaving behind
Take the easiest road
But take care my brother
For you'll never find peace
With a troubled mind

Far better to love each other
Than to worry so deeply
¡®bout the place you're in
And far better to kiss her softly
Than lookin' back on a love
You'll never have again



Time's as fickle as
The sky in winter
And two hearts always
Were better than one
Love has the wings
Of a tireless angel
She'll stay beside you
Till the day is done

La la la la la ...

You'll never have again
No no no, never again
You'll never have again"
15,Abba,Ring_ Ring,TRHMZUX128E078F274,1974,"I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby, by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you

It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me, honey, how can I go on here without you?

Yes, I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oho

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall

And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me?

So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken

Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oho

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall

And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me?

So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Oho, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oho, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?"
16,Tom Waits,Shiver Me Timbers,TRQLHCR128F422F688,1974,"Leavin' my family I'm leavin' all my friends
My body's at home but my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines on a new front page sky
My tears are salt water and the moon's full and high

And I know Martin Eden's is gonna be proud of me
And many before me who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest singin' my say
Shiver me Timbers I'm a sailin' away

The fog's liftin' and the sand's shiftin' and I'm driftin' on out
And ol' Captain Ahab he got nothin' on me
So come on and swallow me don't follow me I'm travelin' alone
Blue water's my daughter an' I'm skippin' like a stone

And please call my misses tell her not to cry
My goodbye is written by the moon in the sky
And nobody knows me I can't fathom my stayin'
And shiver me timbers I'm a sailin' away
The fog's liftin' and the sand's shiftin' and I'm driftin' on out
And ol' Captain Ahab he got nothin' on me
So come on and swallow me don't follow me I'm travelin' alone
Blue water's my daughter an' I'm skippin' like a stone

And I'm leavin' my family I'm leavin' my friends
My body's at home but my heart's in the wind

17,Smokey Robinson,Virgin Man,TRZPIQW128F930AA21,1974,"Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
Virgin man they always put him down
People say he must be ""funny""
He ain't had a taste of honey

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

My gift of love has never been unwrapped
My well of love it still remains untapped (oh baby)

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man
Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But a man who is a man
Ain't supposed to be that way
No no no no no no

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
(wonder what my friends would do if they only knew)
Can you love a virgin man
(I've been saving all my love for you, you)
Can you love a virgin man

They say making love's an art
In which each man should take part
By the time he reaches twenty one
Making love is something that he should have done
It ain't like I've never wanted to
But it's easier to think than it is to do

Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)
Can you (really) love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man"
18,Mott The Hoople,Born Late '58,TRSWMBJ12903CB150F,1974,"Baby took me out last night
Got a little cadillac bite.
Shook me about - inside out
Didn't get home 'till light.

She's a grower, a goer - you gotta get to know her
No chooser, a cruiser - you turn around she'll lose you

Burned out as the light turned green
Smoke-screened off her rail.
He didn't see me comin' but he shoulda saw me runnin'
Faster than the U.S. mail.

She's a speeder, a leader
You're really gotta meet her
You see her, she thrills you, you look at her she'll kill you.

Listen, fella, baby don't you sell her
Don't you try and steal her away
Hush, man logs in her dam
Think you better fade away

Detonator, jail-baiter - a radar radiator
She'll annoy ya, destroy ya - she'll bring ya down in fire
Create her, mistreat her - no use tryin' to beat her
Admit it, she's greater, shame you weren't born later."
19,Leonard Cohen,Chelsea Hotel #2,TRQMFAU128F4272EFA,1974,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said: ""Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often"

Laying beside me
And bluebirds singing right outside my window
Soft warm kisses (kisses)

Might go down to Georgia, I don't know

Well, I dig you Georgia peaches

Feel her skin, feelin' silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside roar until he cried:

Now he's back home doin' 9 to 5
Livin' his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep, old memories keep
More, more, more

entre tus sueños y tu piel
tu alma desnuda

El calor de tu alcoba
me dijo 'quédate...'
te tomé entre mis brazos 
y le di vida a tus sueños...

y en mis brazos 
fuiste mujer

Isabel, Isabel...
lo que yo daría 
por tenerte otra vez

Duró poco tiempo
quién sabe por qué
abriste tus alas 
cuando probaste la miel

Sin querer queriendo 
te llevaste mi fe
y mi orgullo te llora 
donde quiera que estés

Isabel, Isabel...
tú que en mis brazos
fuiste mujer...

Isabel, Isabel..
lo que yo daría 
por tenerte otra vez...

no es tan fácil 
como llorar...

Quiero romper
este silencio a placer
porque olvidar 
no es como llorar...

24,Rino Gaetano,Agapito Malteni Il Ferroviere,TRPSJBK128F42A406C,1974,"Agapito Malteni era un ferroviere
viveva a Manfredonia giù nel Tavoliere
buona educazione di spirito cristiano
ed un locomotore sotto mano.
Di buona famiglia giovane e sposato
negli occhi si leggeva: molto complessato
faceva quel mestiere forse per l'amore
di viaggiare sul locomotore.
Seppure complessato il cuore gli piangeva
quando la sua gente andarsene vedeva
perché la gente scappa ancora non capiva.
Dall'alto della sua locomotiva
La gente che abbandona spesso il suo paesello
lasciando la sua falce in cambio di un martello
ricorda nei suoi occhi nel suo cuore errante
il misero guadagno di un bracciante.
Una tarda sera partì da Torre a Mare
doveva andare a Roma e dopo ritornare
pensò di non partire o pure senza fretta
di lasciare il treno a Barletta.
Svelò il suo grande piano all'altro macchinista
buono come lui ma meno utopista
parlò delle città di genti emigrate
a Gorgonzola oppure a Vimercate.
E l'altro macchinista capì il suo compagno
felice e soddisfatto del proprio guadagno
e con le parole cercava di calmarlo
fu una mano ad addormentarlo."

The reasons for my life are in a million faces 
Like aching promises I feel them in my bones 
Slipping through my fingers to dance upon the road 
The reasons for my life are more than I can hold 
But oh, the sweet delight to sing with all my might 
To spark the inner light of wonder burning bright 
You're not alone 
You're not alone 

The reasons for my life are buried in deep places 
Words once could awaken them 
these seeds that I have sown 
Ringing through the madness to crash against the cold 
The reasons for my life cannot be bought or sold 

The reasons for my life are filling all my spaces 
Like rushing waters flow, they carry me along 
Twisting through my memory to pull free from the load 
The reasons for my life are more than I was told"

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, and I remember something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all lead me straight back home to you

'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with the waves of grain
And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee

We flew straight across that river bridge, 
last night a half past two
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye 
and so long as we went rolling through
Billboards and truckstops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something 
that I've never been shown

And I saw my devil, 
and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from 
Cheyenne to Tennessee

The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town

Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town

Oh, but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true

In the shadow that you cast on me, and you
You're something ne

Life seemed oh so temporary
A case of ""here and gone""
And I survived just barely
Until you came along

Is one more day I know

He needs time – he needs time for livin',
He needs time – for someone just to see him.
He ain't had no lovin'
For no reason nor rhyme
And the whole world's above him.
Well it's not as though he's fat –
No there's more to it than that –
See he tries to play it cool –
Wouldn't be nobody's fool.

Rudy thought that all good things comes to those that wait
But recently he could see that it may come too late.
Too late, too late…

All through your life, all through the years
Nobody loved, nobody cared.
So dim the light, dark are your fears
Try as I might, I can't hold back the tears.
How can you live without love, it's not fair?
Someone said give but I just didn't dare, I didn't dare, I didn't dare.
What good advice are you waiting to hear?
Hearing's alright for them that's all there, hearing's alright
You'd better, you'd better gain control now
You'd better show 'em all now
You'd better make or break now
You'd better give and take now
You'll have to push and shove now
You'll have to find some love now
You'd better gain control now.

Sad but in a while he'll soon be

sottotenente. Nel 1793 fu promosso generale, nel 1799 promosso
primo console, nel 1804 si promosse imperatore. Nel 1805 si promosse
re d’Italia. E chi non ricorderà tutte queste date, sarà bocciato!)
C’era una volta un imperatore, si chiamava Napoleone.
E quando non aveva torto, di sicuro aveva ragione... Napoleone

Napoleone era fatto così
Se diceva di no, non diceva di sì
Quando andava di là, non veniva di qua
Se saliva lassù, non scendeva quaggiù
Se correva in landò, non faceva il caffè
Se mangiava un bigné, non contava per tre
Se diceva di no, non diceva di sì

Napoleone andava a cavallo e la gente lo stava a vedere
E quando non andava a piedi, era proprio un cavaliere... Napoleone!

Se diceva di no, non diceva di sì
Quando andava di là, non veniva di qua
Se cascava di lì, non cascava di qui
Se faceva popò, non diceva però
Quando apriva l’oblò, non chiudeva il comò
Se diceva di sì, non diceva di no

Di tutti gli uomini della terra, Napoleone era il più potente.
E quando aveva la bocca chiusa, non diceva proprio niente... Napoleone!

Now, you were here when they crashed on down and the geckos (?) got smacked up
And now all of God's children, they gettin' what they want
When they get the ticket

Everytime he comes around I feel like I'm on fire 
When he looks into my eyes and sees down to my soul 
It's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire 
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole 
How am I to know? 

Now I ain't lookin' for a man to hold me for an hour 
I ain't lookin' for a man to love me for a day 
Every time he comes around I get the funny feelin' 
What I'm looking for don't matter anyway 
Hey, it don't matter anyway 

'Cause every since I was a child 
I dreamed about my baby's smile 
It scares me so to say 
I wanna be with him in the worst darn way 

Cause every time he comes around I feel like I'm on fire 
When he whispers in my ear I start to lose control 
Still it's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire 
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole 
How am I to know? 

Cause every since I was a child 
I dreamed about my baby's smile 
It scares me so to say 
I wanna be with him in the worst darn way

Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts, oh

I am the entertainer and I've had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first, I learned by doing twice
But still they come to haunt me, still they want their say
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way

I am the entertainer, been all around the world
I've played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls
I can't remember faces, I don't remember names
Oh, but what the hell, you know it's just as well
'Cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same

I am the entertainer, I bring to you my songs
I'd like to spend a day or two, but I can't stay that long
I got to meet expenses, I got to stay in line
Got to get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time

I am the entertainer, I've come to do my show
You've heard my latest record spin on the radio
Oh, it took me years to write it, they were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song, but it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit you gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3:05

I am the entertainer, the idol of my age
I make all kinds of money when I go on the stage
Ah, you see me in the papers, I've been in the magazines
But if I go cold, I won't get sold
I get put in the back in a discount rack
Like another can of beans

I am the entertainer and I know just where I stand

Today I am your champion, I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
I won't be here in another year

Following me and wanting you
To think of a time
And keep me in mind

I know you've had many
And I haven't any to show
But what I can't give you
I'll equal with love

When darkness resolves to slumber
Remember that I'm your number one
That you can call
So keep me in mind

I know that while needing someone
Is only a thought that comes from me
Hoping that you
Will keep me in mind

When she served him up some chili and a beer

Was across between excitement and the fear
He looked as hard and dry as the back roads that he traveled
Chasin' rodeos through half a hundred towns
He said hang up your apron honey and brush down your hair
And well go ya hooin around
He's a true western movie without any star ge's something like she's never known
But she's seen enough movies to know how they'll end
He'll ride into the sunset alone

He makes her feel like a kid cuttin' school
But by now she should be old enough to know
That today ain't forever and there's only so long
You can't take all your pleasures to go
But as long as it lasts she'll just keep hangin' on cause she's just along for the ride
And Lord if they fly to high and even if she falls all she can hurt is her pride
He's a true western movie..."

A penny for his thoughts can make you richer
His eyes can see what other eyes could not
What is the power of Napolean
But not mere power, but magnetism
And magnetism is more intelligent than force
Magnetism is more intelligent than force

And you can't get it on

And you got to carry on
And you shoot out the light
Ain't coming home for the night
You know you got to, got to, got to pay the price 

Somebody please, please help me
You know I'm drowning in the sea of hatred 

Got to get down, down on my knees

Going down on love

Going down, going down, going down

Disappears in thin air
And it seems so unfair

And you sow your wild oats

For even so I still remain your lover in captivity

The leaves have fallen, the men have gone
Green sleeves, there's no one home
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves

I sang my songs, I told my lies
To lie between your matchless thighs
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild
To finally end our exercise
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new
I reached for you but you were gone
So lady I'm going too

Green sleeves, you're all alone
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone

On the table at noon

I know it's just another that you've written to yourself

On the beat in all his Pierrot fashion*

Don't move your feet until the next beat comes -

Though I would hate to make the game seem mean
Hey my pretty flower can you guess where I've been?
Can you guess at all?
I've been to your rooms and learned
you have all the mirrors turned against the wall

We watched a distant drummer flashing*
On the beat in all his Pierrot fashion*

One won money, two want a show,**

It won't be pleasant when the present time is done
testing nightly 'neath a sprightly summer moon

I started sinking a bottle of gin

And I'm spacebound again, I need the money
And I can't see the stars, it's so funny,
Until I'm earthbound again, I'll miss you honey
In this rocket cathedral pointing to the sky

Some visit Lucifer, some may be crucified,
I'm goin' to Mars
Some talk to celluloid, some talk to shiny cars,
I talk to stars

I've been thinking 'bout all the ways
That a whizz man spends all his days
In a rocket cathedral pointing to the sky
Wish I was grounded, and see the last of my days
And get rebounded down the Milky Way
In a rocket cathedral pointing to the stars.

So I'm spacebound again, who needs the money
And I can't see the stars, I feel so funny,
Until I'm earthbound again, I'll miss you honey

it lingers like the patterns on the window after rain,
a past that lives, if only for the present,
but which is gone and will never come again.

To your sad eyes, turned away, mine say
""Do you? Did you? How?""
As the darkness slides away the day
shows what was and makes what is now.

I see your picture as though it were a mirror
but there's no part of you outside the frame

I've gotta find a way just to make my day a useful one
Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show
I've got one free pass just to let me know

Hey babe it's a stagnant time
But it takes more than that to hang my coat and hat and sleep
I've gotta sweat once more till my bones feel sore
I tell you why

Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show
I've gotta crash this prison and not let go
My heart's on a sun cloud screamin' for progress
'Cause I want work
I'll keep slavin' my mind just to try to find some kind of light

I'm gonna burn this damn ticket and think of tomorrow
And I won't live this long life in stagnation no more

Cause I'm a man
And man's gotta work"

Swish around a cocktail the stewardess brings by 

Lord, this is the life for me 
Lord, oh Lord, this is the life for me 
But I don't wanna die in an air disaster 
I don't wanna die on a plane 

Well, I fishtail through the lanes, and I make my tires squeal 
Power at my feet and glory at the wheel 
And I wind the windows down, let the wind blow through my hair 
God knows where I'm going, but me, I don't care 

Lord, this is the life for me 
Lord, oh Lord, this is the life for me 
But I don't wanna die in a freeway pile-up 
I don't wanna die on the road 

Well, I'm young and I'm pretty, and I wanna stay that way 
Wanna be desirable 'til my dying day 
I don't wanna be bedridden, an old and bitter sage 
Have the nurses saying I'm young for my age 
(""He's young for his age."") 

Oh Lord, don't let me go that way 
Lord, oh Lord, don't let me go that way 
No, don't make me go like a fading chorus 
Don't make me fade like a song 

Lord, have mercy on your son

That they go away but still they begin

Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
Hey I thought I was smart
I'd won his heart
I didn't think I'd lose
But I see she worst to him than me
Let him go ahead take her love instead
And one day he will see
Just how to say please

Wow and get down on his knees
That's how it begins
Hurtin' him hurtin' him
Why can't I stop and tell myself
It's wrong so wrong
Why can't I stand up
Tell myself to be strong

Because I saw him today
I saw his face it was the face I love
I can't let go, although I know
He'll make me cry until the day I die

But people I got to live now
Wow Lord knows I should forgive now
That's how they begin
You'll feel those needles and pins

Somebody take'em away now

There's frosting on the window pane and sorrow in your eyes 
The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone 
You slowly turn away from me and tears begin to come 

And it's 
Goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you 
Goodbye again, 'cause if you didn't know 
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me 
Why do we always fight when I have to go? 

It seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and warm 
I long to lay me down again and hold you in my arms 
I long to kiss the tears away and give you back your smile 
But other voices beckon me and for a little while 

It's 
Goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you 
Goodbye again, 'cause if you didn't know 
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me 
Why do we always fight when I have to go? 

I have to go and see some friends of mine, and some that I don't know 
And some who aren't familiar with my name 
It's something that's inside of me, not hard to understand 
It's anyone who will listen to me sing 

But if your arms are empty now, then who am I to blame 
You think if I was always here our love would be the same 
But as it is, the time we have is worth the time alone 
And lying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever known 

But it's 
Goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leaving you 
Goodbye again, 'cause if you didn't know

Wounded in the line of duty,
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties,
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles.
Leave it all and like a man,
Come back to nothing special,
Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,
Silver bullet suicides,
And messianic ocean tides,
And racial roller-coaster rides
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry.

I know you need your sleep now,
I know your life's been hard.
But many men are falling,
Where you promised to stand guard.

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor.
But then I overheard your prayer,
That you be this and nothing more
Than just some grateful faithful woman's favourite singing millionaire,
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair,
Working for the Yankee Dollar.

I know you need your sleep now,
I know your life's been hard.
But many men are falling,
Where you promised to stand guard.

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are,
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child.
Then let the other selves be ONE, yeah, let them manifest and come
Till every taste is on the tongue,
Till love is pierced and love is hung,
And every kind of freedom done, then oh,
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love,
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love."

he can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.
It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
a song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away; make my pain
the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.
He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Each one to the other had become
More than a friend, living to meet a common end
They were true, each one knew all is well

Still the elder knew it could not last
Hidden memories from the young one's past
Drew them apart
Both knew that deep within his heart they must part
Each their own separate way

It puzzles me how we can be so close and yet worlds apart
Can it be, my memory has torn my life in two
From the very start
I screamed for the devil to let me be
I called to the heavens to set me free
Today I prayed for the answer and not one
Of the gods in the sky would rescue me

Dreams of fortune fill the young one's mind
Learn the worldly ways of hope to find
Love on the way, searching to find the light of day
In his soul he had found his own way

But to each other they soon will return
Destiny fulfilled, their words will burn an eternal flame"

Never seen my daddy, died when I was two
Mama did the best she could, taught me all she knew
Said that love was everything, tears came to her eyes
Never knew the meaning, now I realise
Love is all you need, all you need now
If you just take me

I'm trying hard to get you, I'm not the only one
Never had a big car, but I'm not on the run

She was drinkin' advocaat
Her skin was smooth and her jeans were tight
You didn't think she'd go that far
She mighta looked like a princess
But why'd you have to give her your address
Cos you ain't safe when you get home
She's gonna call you on the telephone

Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Hey boy that's Balwyn callin'
Get on the phone and do a bit of stallin'

It was just too easy when you got to her flat
And she kicked off her platform shoes
And you played around like a cat and a rat
And now you've got the Balwyn blues
Well you thought she ould be a one nighter
But she wants to squeeze you tighter
Cos you ain't safe when you get home
She's gonna call you on the telephone

She sure knows when she's got a good catch
And she just won't let go
She's been searchin' for the perfect match
Her ambition with your dough
A brick veneer prison is waitin' for you
But you just smile while she turns the screw
And you ain't safe when you get home she
She's gonna call you on the telephone

Hey boy that's Balwyn calling X 3
Get off the phone and get out of Balwyn"

Don't want to spend it one my own 
This time tomorrow I'll be on the road 
So I got to get on the telephone 
I need to see you girl, before I go away 
Just got to have your love to remember 
Your precious company, ooh 
that's what I need today 
I won't be back until September 

You give me pleasure like I never had 
I guess you know just what I like 
Even if I'm not your only man 
You make me feel as if I am 

So tonight I want to have you to myself 
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning light 
Don't want you running to no one else 
Just wanna love you tonight 

There is a saying you better not forget 
It's always come true for me 
They say that what you see is what you get 
And woman, you're all that I can see 
That's why I'm asking you, oh just try and 
understand me, baby 

This ain't time for silly games 
And I'm a desperate man, can't you hear it in my voice 
Without your love I just wouldn't be the same 
So I'm putting my heart out to you, my love 
Doing everything within my power 
Now I've done my best - did I hear you say yes 
I'll be round at your door within the hour

Diamonds are forever, and gold can make you lie
But your eyes of silver shine on, shine on 

Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all
Rubies by the hundreds fill the Taj Mahal
Eyes of silver, you tell me what I need
To bring this cold and lonely man
Down to his bended knees
Inside my lovin' arms are open wide
For you eyes of silver

Or merely the connenction 
To the God of Love

Must find the right direction"

Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss

I can't get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snow's so deep
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
On a night like this

Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty a room for all
So please don't elbow me

Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door
If I'm not too far off I think we did this once before
There's more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss

Holding on to Daddy's thumb just as tightly as he can hold;
And it's hearing people say he looks alot like his daddy,
These things are a poor man's gold.

It's the twinkle in the eyes of the gray haired old man we call Grandpa,
Telling tales to the kids that get taller every time they're told;
And it's knowing that for awhile he's no longer lonely,
These things are a poor man's gold.

It's the smell of honeysuckle in the springtime,
It's the silence of a freshly fallen snow;
It's the sound of children laughing in the sunshine,
It's a crisp Autumn night with a million stars all aglow.

It's the sweet, sleepy sound of your warm and gentle breathing,
As you cling to me in the night to keep away the cold;
And it's the softness of your body there in the darkness,
These things are a poor man's gold.

Honey, these precious things are a poor man's gold."

You hammer on my thoughts through dreams
Your plot is thick with saucy schemes
And ways to reach my balconies
But I say I'm not turned on by the way you look
I say I'm not turned on by the way you act
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you need me
But sometimes, just sometimes
You can see the softness in my eyes
And you know, It's just not true

You're in my blood, a Holy Ghost
I scream, but it's a hollow plea
The thoughts I swallow leave me thirsty
You do a very fine imitation of me
And I say I'm not turned on by the way you laugh
I'm not turned on by the way you smile
I'm not turned on when you tell me that you love me
But sometimes, just sometimes
You can see the softness in my eyes
And you know, it's just not true

'Cause girl you really tried

There were two times that I cried
And you were tryin' to make me your martyr

And we would decide it in four hours
And count the blame on Ty Bear Jones?
Never see me when you doin' last night
You gonna go on and have a fight
And in the missed street bend their ways
You know the Devil's got to have his way

When the line of fright is in sight
What you gonna do? (Whatcha gonna do?)
Turn to the left, or look right?

He is a sore loser, if you're a user, every emotions are given to pride
You can't wait until after the fight

Are you used, so just start thinking
Like shifting out of concrete centers
All the things that we see each day
Only fools can afford to play

People in Russia and China
And the folks in the carolinas (folks in the Carolinas)
We couldn't blame this on ""No-Neck""
You've gotta learn to be a good fighter
And if you're thinkin' out on the night
You're gonna go and have a fight (gonna go and have a fight)
And like Nixon at McDonald's, so late
It's goin' down with the Watergate

The message in these generations
It's going through and out to the nations

We'd better stop and think for a while
Think about it deeper, we can't wait until after the fight
We can't wait until after the fight

Midst the pillows, the beads and the stereo leads and the ups and the downs in the gin 

Oh Mary, oh Mary, the stars of the prairie 
Still shine on your high stepping shoes 
But those were the days, Mary, those were the days 
When you side stepped the Hollywood blues 

When the money ran low all your friends found excuses 
The family soon fell apart 
And you learned there's a limit to what you can do 
When your purse ain't as big as your heart 

But still you're blasting off somewhere on something with somebody new 
And nobody knows what he does, where he comes from, nobody, least of all you

Oh take some good advice from me
And let the wires rock

All dressed in black so nobody sees you
Smile in the wings, tell me I please you
Call me a king and watch for the wordworm to choke me

And you're like a giraffe, the performance is poor
Watch the audience laugh as my head hits the floor
When I'm broken in half you still reach for the floor
STOP!

I've had enough of this

I need -you feed
I greed - you bleed

I died -You're dead

Marionette - I ain't one yet

A traitor, deceiver, a groovy disbeliever I thought
A puppet was a thing cheap-taught - No way
Creator, conceiver, romantic love receiver - caught

""Who are you""
""The nerve""
I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get
Out, AHHHHH!

Oh he wanna play chords to the chick on the street
He wanna play words to a world that don't speak
He wanna play people who play hide 'n' seek when they don't talk

He wanna play a riff to the man with the wires
He wanna play lead but his hand's getting tired
He just wanna play but don't know how to say - STOP

OK, the show's been fun
But my wood's begun to warp
They won -I'm done
New one - begun

Marionette - I did my best
Teacher's pet - It just couldn't last
Marionette - Get me out of this mess
Teacher's little pet - It happened so fast
Marionette - Now I need a rest
Teacher's pet - Where's my sanity gone - Mother?
Marionette - I did my best

Nu vandrer de på sletterne
Og stammens gamle mænd,
De synger op til stjernerne:
Lad det aldrig ske igen.

På gaden i den døde by
Der sidder Stakkels Jim,
I nattens mørke drømmer han
Om den tid, der var engang.

""En dag tog pokker pludselig ved menneskene,
De forlod deres store byer og deres fabrikker
Og deres flotte biler.
Og gik ud på sletten og sagde,
La' os begynde helt forfra igen.
Men tilbage i den døde by,
Der sidder der en mand som ikke kan glemme den tid
Og det er ham som de kalde Stakkels Jim.""

Just a few of those little precious things
That there's smiles in my eyes
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
Just another toy that is ruined
So I'm flying free, know that I'm wild

And I'll be spinnin' and spinnin'

167,Joni Mitchell,Woman Of Heart And Mind (Live LP Version),TRJUQXK128F428D803,1974,"I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh?
Do you really care?
Do you really smile
When you smile?
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try"
168,The Who,Long Live Rock,TRTHBCT128E078F151,1974,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down 'round our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead

The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive"
169,Los Pasteles Verdes,Recuerdos de Una Noche,TRPWTJP12903CADA0F,1974,"Quiero, recordar esta noche,

momentos, que no volveran,

y hacer, de aquellos poemas,

tristes, como una oracion.

----

Una oracion, que tiene mucho amor,

como el que yo, te tuve alguna vez,

tanto amor, que no puedo explicar,

por que ya, no estas aqui.

----

Junto a mi, como ayer en mis brazos,

mirando el cielo, la obscuridad,

y asi estoy, recordando, tu amor."
170,John Denver,Back Home Again,TRCZEZF12903CBAB30,1974,"There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon lies heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding
On his prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
Like a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That keeps him warm

Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him
How you've spent your time
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
And you felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

And all the time that I can lay this tired old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for 
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing i know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
And it's the light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again
I said hey it's good to be back home again..."

Outro grande amor antes do teu
Tive, sim
O que ela sonhava eram os meus sonhos e assim
Íamos vivendo em paz
Nosso lar, em nosso lar sempre houve alegria
Eu vivia tão contente
Como contente ao teu lado estou
Tive, sim
Mas comparar com o teu amor seria o fim
Eu vou calar
Pois não pretendo amor te magoar"
172,John Hiatt,Ocean,TRRTRAH128F92CA34F,1974,"I am the west wind.
I am the sea gull.
I dance on the waves,
As they break on the shore line. 

The moon is my sorrow.
The moon is my lantern.
I search for you so long,
These dark lonely beaches. 

Oh where can you be?
This restless sea,
These empty nights,
Have swallowed me. 

Look for something
Softer illusions
Soothe these vicious schemes.
There is the old one,
The wise one, the gold one. 

I am the hunger,
The ache of the fiction,
And nestles in bones,
That he left for the vultures. 

Death is my secret,
A child my illusion,
And life is the suffering,
That brings men to know me and.. 

Oh, where can you be?
This raging age,
This rotting life,
Is misery. 

Lost in your body,
Cave of you screeming,
Longing to be free.
Then you have broken,
The spine of your madness,
Come over here to me."
173,Aerosmith,Lord Of The Thighs,TRAEATL128F42690A7,1974,"Down to who knows who, just to socialize
I'm waiting for my girls, when you caught my eyes
You got no way to make a man
Honey you got to understand
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs!

Well, well, lordy my God, what do we got here
She's flashin' 'cross the floor, make it perfectly clear
You're the bait and you're the hook
Someone bound to take a look
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs!

You must've come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of your thighs!

174,Olivia Newton-John,Please Mr Please,TRHZODQ128F932972A,1974,"In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox 
With the best of country music, old and new 
You can hear your five selections for a quarter 
And somebody else's songs when yours are through 

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter 
And my friends around to help me ease the pain 
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song 
And here I am just missing you again 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again 

If I had a dime for every time I held you 
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me 
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville 
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee 

But I guess I'd better get myself together 
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind 
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture 
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind 

Please, Mr., please, don't play B-17 
It was our song, it was his song, but it's over 
Please, Mr., please, if you know what I mean 
I don't ever wanna hear that song again"

Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But baby, you won't be there

Knowing the love we'll miss
So let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

176,Scorpions,Fly To The Rainbow,TRAUFYI128F92D2123,1974,"Life is empty, can't remember anytime before 
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore 
Gliding through this life and another is a child 
And we're doing games and losing things 
Always playing gigs 

Somewhere in the sky 
Where the moon, the stars shine bright 
Where the sun is shining in the night 
I am in disgrace yet I see a smiling face 
And I hope you let me share your place 

I don't live today

Rain in the sky, make the world fly 
Into time, beg me your time 
Sun in the sky, make the world fly 
Into time, beg me your time 

Rain in the sky, make the world fly 
Into time, beg me your time

Into time, beg me your time 

Rain in the sky, make the world fly 
Into time, beg me your time 
Sun in the sky, make the world fly 
Into time, beg me your time 

Well, I lived in magic solitude 
Of cloudy looking mountains 
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops 
Roaming through space two thousand years ago 
I've seen the giant city of Atlantis 
Sinking into eternal waves of darkness 

Somewhere in the blue distance 
Are those long forgotten trees of yore 
A broken violin floating alone in December 
Darkness everywhere and nothing more 

Symbol, strange symbol, melancholy 
Painting torrid colors on a sky of green 
Candle, breathing one night only 
Far away in chillness, bleak, unseen 

Drifting galley, ghostlike shadow 
Sails rigged to catch and kill the time 
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow 
To call the thing sublime"
177,Kansas,Lonely Wind,TREPUKV128F4263A5D,1974,"When I'm needin' a friend I can talk to the wind
God I sure am glad that I found him
Sometimes he seems to be the only one beside me
Who can feel the Lord's breath all around him
Winter's cold frozen ice or a bright autumn day
On a warm summer night you can hear him say

Cry for me, sigh for me, sad my breezes flow
Stay for me, play for me, the song my friends will know
My lonely wind must blow

Mighty friend that is mine, can you give me a sign?
He'll leave nothing but only to hear him
I've seen the tall trees bend low when his mighty winds blow
And that's all the more reason I fear him
Hear him call for the earth lonely I can feel his great pain
But on the eve of this day
I'll join in his refrain

When I'm needing a friend I'll remember the wind
And my life here with the breezes of sorrow
I'll be leaving him soon 'cause I've got to make room
For the lonely that will find him tomorrow
On a black stormy night in your bosom I'll cling
And I'll know I've found love and the last song we'll sing"

She doesn't have to say - she only has to look
I think she sees through me - reads me like a book
And I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me
And the love goes sailin' on - across the stormy seas.

Mmmmm, I got my babe, Mmmmm, I got my babe,
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'

Woohooo....Woohooo

Sometimes I go over the line, she has to bring me down,
And the pride pulls heavy, makes some evil sounds.
But I'm in love with her, and she's in love with me
And the sea runs calmer now, I kiss the love that sleeps.

Mmmm, I got my babe, Mmmm I got my babe,
She's a right-on child, she goes smilin'

O-O-Oh....O-O-Oh

Mmmm, I got my babe, Mmmm I got my babe,

To give me a line
She said boy what have you done
Passing your time with a holy man
Talking about the moon and sun
But I can't tell the difference
Between the fool and wise
Show me a river to follow
Away from all these lies

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been picking up my bones too long
Won't you understand

Called to the captain
To put me ashore
For it looked like no man's land
Is this the way to follow
I cried as I shook his hand
He told me had no answer
He didn't really hold the key
I am a simple man
Was all he said to me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me a hand
I've been out in the cold too long
Won't you understand
I've been on the road so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been out in the cold too long
Won't you understand

Heard my mother crying
She was calling out my name
Whisper in the dark night
Saying who's to blame
The hour glass keeps turning
With not enought sand to see
I am a holy man
So don't you bother me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been pickin' up my bones too long

Bring the dust of dusty evening
Weave the spell of evening
Into patterns of my life

How her perfume still entrances
Soft, serene, she dances
Moving sweetly through my life

Does it whisper
Voices calling gently through the night

Smokey day, hey
Your enchanting light is leaving
Silver haze is leaving
And bringing to me peaceful night"

It was so incomplete.
Till a good woman's love.

Now instead of roamin' I go home in the evening.
And she's waiting there.
And I know that no matter what happens.
She'll always care.

And so, when the night fall's.
And the stars shine above.
Well I'm a man with a dream.

Hey hey, ah

Take me to the river
Wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul
Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad

My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know

Il tuo corpo vicino
Io nel buio ti chiedo
Di portarmi con te.

Ti ho portato insieme a me

Mi sembrava primavera.

Che cosa succede?
Mi dici di cercare una casa
Per vivere insieme:
Un grande giardino
Sospeso nel cielo
E mille bambini con gli occhi
Dipinti d'amore.
Allora i pensieri
Non sono illusioni,
Allora è proprio vero che io
Sto volando con te.

And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking, and
And I need you"
193,Peter Hammill,Tapeworm,TRSFJOG128F14590A3,1974,"When I was a child they made me read
word-daggers of quiver and squirm;
now in the stumbling dark I see 
I am a worm, silently fruiting your garden,
my sister ,my child .
Night casts ominous meanings on the purity of my soul
I feel devilish leanings I'm beginning to lose control 
and the vortex sucks me in.
Steeped in sin I die 
but am reborn.

I want to see the cosmos slip,
planets and moons collide,
feel gravity lose its grip...
it's all inside
All the dead husks are shattered, 
my life-blood, my world ripped apart 
in the laughter of space
it's all chaff blown out and lost.
Now I am making the pace 
although I don't know what tape I'll cross...
maybe catastrophe.
When I cross the line 
I know that I will find myself 
or maybe you.

I am a man from the country of destruction,
I am a man a woman and a god,
I am my own weapon of kamikaze
and will one day cut through the
hidden knot

Feed me honey and watch me rise 
to the bait lying on the knife;
if you let me I can hypnotise your life. 
It's all really so simple,
my lover, my twin. 
Hand in hand, sprinting down the highway, 
running over the edge, 
on and on into our doomsday;
there is no saving ledge 
nor outgrown shrub.
Is this the way?
Out in a blaze of glory? 
Some day I'll find the answer
some day I'll 
end the story."
194,Johnny Cash,While I've Got It On My Mind,TRDFECM128F42720E7,1974,"Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine

I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town

We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
'Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook

Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind

Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
'Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy

And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind

Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got in on my mind"

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low, and it had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm

How long, I wondered, could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere"

Then you didn't even say goodnight

Now, if you tired 'n' you don't wan' be bothered, baby
Just say the word and I'll leave you 'lone

by Carole King &amp; David Palmer

You and I
We ought to try to face the fact
The things we thought had value
They've all been taken back
We've been losing track of time
But time's no easy mark
I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart

I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart

You and me
It seems that we've been holding out
The things that once held meaning
We're no longer sure about
We've been moving down the line
Losing what time we've got
And since you say you've had a change in mind
Why don't you try a little change of heart

I can see you've got a change in mind
But what we need is a change of heart

Now I'm not asking anymore of you
Than I ask of myself
Oh, but when I say we need a new approach
Well, I don't mean to someone else

Change, they say
It's the only way we grow
Oh, but the change we're showing
Let me tell you I just don't know
Seems to me that we could find some 
other way to start
Beginning with a change, a change in mind
And ending with a change, a change of heart
Oh, begin it with a change, a change in mind
But end it with a change, a change of heart"

Wide-eyed, one eye fixed on the door

Day in day out, my feet are burning holes in the ground

Darkness warmer than a bedroom floor
Want someone to hold me close forever more
I'm a sleeping dog, but you can't tell
When I'm on the prowl you'd better run like hell
You know it makes sense, don't even think about it
Life and death are just things that you do when you're bored

Say fear's a man's best friend
Say fear's a man's best friend

Home is living like a man on the run
Trails leading nowhere, where to my son?
We're already dead, but not yet in the ground
Take my helping hand I'll show you around

Searchin' for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Loew

Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro, used to play it 'cross his knees
I'd give old Curt my money, he'd play all day for me

Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues

He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whup me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two then take another drink of wine

Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money, tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
Yes sir

On the day old Curtis died nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words, and they chucked him in the clay
But he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to do

Play me a song Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said you were useless, them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues"

From the kitchen I called ""Who's that there?"" 
Through the letter box came a grappling hook 
Which grappled me right out of my chair! 
Stretched out on the floor I lay helpless 
Of my limbs I had lost all command 
When into my ear instilling fear 
Said a voice ""I am Monsieur Armand"" 

""Monsieur Armand you are not! 
That's an incredible thing to say 
For I personally attended his funeral 
Which was twelve months to this very day!"" 
A rat flew down from the ceiling 
Alighted upon my right ear 
Said ""If Monsieur Armand is safe under the sod 
Then why are you shaking with fear!"" 

""My name is not Scrooge"" I said faintly 
""and from ghosts I have nothing to fear! 
But if you are Armand returned from the dead 
Then what are you wanting here?"" 
From nowhere I heard a mad cackle 
From nowhere a voice to me cried 
""Stop calling me Monsieur Armand you fool! 
My name's Jekyll and you're Mr. Hyde!"""

Eu fico ao teu lado sem saber 
Dos amores que a vida me trouxe

Eu perdi o meu medo, o meu medo
O meu medo da chuva
Pois a chuva voltando pra terra 
Traz coisas do ar
Aprendi o segredo, o segredo
O segredo da vida
Vendo as pedras que choram
Sozinhas no mesmo lugar

Eu não posso entender tanta gente 
Aceitando a mentira
De que os sonhos desfazem 
Aquilo que o padre falou
Porque quando eu jurei meu amor 
Eu traí a mim mesmo
Hoje eu sei que ninguém nesse mundo
É feliz tendo amado uma vez
Uma vez

Eu perdi o meu medo, o meu medo
O medo da chuva
Pois a chuva voltando pra terra 
Traz coisas do ar
Aprendi o segredo, o segredo

Never fear
How close each year
I'm winter
Reminding me to trade my t-shirts for my woven wools
Trade my sandals for my skis
Whispered warnings in the wind
Saying soon come the dancing snowflakes
They're kissing every tree
They're kissing you and me
Please hurry
Falling
Dazzling dancing diamonds from the sky
Prisms
Rainbow sparkled flurries in our eyes
Whipping across the frozen crystal metal pines of ice
Race the snow
We'll spend the mornings by our bed
They cuddle close and wine and dine
The setting sun
The morning light will blind those eyes
Shooting down the glistening
Outside
Screaming through the whispering pines
The freedom of each day
Will cleanse our minds

I can hardly wait for the snow
I can hardly hardly wait for winter
I can hardly wait for the snow

And leave my loved ones far behind to follow rodeo
Though you haven't got a dime you know just where to go
You'll pack your hat and riggin' sack to another rodeo
Some folks say that you're a bum but you know that isn't so
You are just a happy guy on the only road you know

You bucked down at Mount Isa when you got hot from the swell
And you missed one out at Alice Springs but they said you spurred him well
Feeling bruised and battered and your sprits mighty low

Pistol on her hip in case she needed a thrill

I said, come on with me, baby
Don't you want to ride with me
She put her hand into her bag, now

Sneakin' 'round the corner, drinkin' whiskey from a jar

Fed to the teeth with a barrage of views

I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself
Starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're gonna do next

You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message
Comes through

And it says to you
Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival and
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand

I had a woman
Who gave me her soul
But I wasn't ready to take it
Her heart was so fragile
And heavy to hold
And I was afraid
I might break it

Your conscience awakes
And you see your mistakes
And you wish someone
Would buy your confessions

The days miss their mark
And the night gets so dark
And some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message
Shoots through

And it says to you
Love when you can
Cry when you have to
Be who you must
That's a part of the plan
Await your arrival
With simple survival and
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand
One day, we'll all understand

There is no Eden
Or heavenly gates
That you're gonna
Make it to one day

You seek can be found
In the dreams that
You dream on the way"

Working steady in a good time band
Pickin' every single little lick I could
Just to please the man
Harlan sang the lead for half
And we split up the rest
Hangin' on through the heavy times
And hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all
Them places that we played in
All them squirrely party girls
And pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in
Those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it 'til we'd make it to the top

Chorus:
And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song

Now we're stars and shining on
Them prime time t.v. shows
Every stranger knows our name
And every little where we go
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different
&gt;From the top
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'
When you drop

And I've left some of my soul on
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had
The worst I had was good

Somethin' that crossed over from another century?

Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walkin' the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things
I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place
My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton
Somethin' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on"

Oh what I did can't be undone 
Borrowed time there's none to buy 

Well I hid round the back of a derelict shack 
Ain't looking for a mad showdown

The job he had it didn't pay 
He told all about what happened that night 
There he is, that's the one's all he'd say

Drew out his gun it wasn't for fun

I look through all the garbage
To see if there are any eyes inside
I'll put 'em in my pink leather bag
And take all their eye balls

All your fears I fear I once shared
Now I know there's a future for all of us
Not so long ago I was so scared

You seemed so sad, I could see through your twisted smile
So unsure, Always confused
Pale blue eyes gazing down from your ivory tower
Through the haze all broken and bruised

Then out of the blue love came rushing in
Out of the sky came the sun
Out of left field came a lucky day
Out of the blue no more pain

I don't mind if it's only a passing craze
Throwaway lines often ring true
If I were you I would stay for a little while
If you were me would you walk out in style?"

The crowd had formed a ring

Betty Butt, Bella Butt

But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched, you know

And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door

Angie girl, are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At the night through the window blind

I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie baby (Angie baby, Angie baby)

When he walks in her room, he feels confused
Like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
Till his soul has lost its way

And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied

It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side

Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along

Now that the spring is in the air

When you see them, I'll be there

And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground

Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere

You never see us 'cause we don't come around.
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down.
But we need you now, and that's why I'm hangin' 'round.
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you,
And in this land of conditions I'm not above suspicion
I won't attack you, but I won't back you.

Well, it's so good to be here, asleep on your lawn.
Remember your guard dog? Well, I'm afraid that he's gone.
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long.
Yes, that was me with the doves, setting them free near the factory
Where you built your computer, love.
I hope you get the connection, 'cause I can't take the rejection
I won't deceive you, I just don't believe you.

Well, I'm a barrel of laughs, with my carbine on
I keep 'em hoppin', till my ammunition's gone.
But I'm still not happy, I feel like there's something wrong.
I got the revolution blues, I see bloody fountains,
And ten million dune buggies comin' down the mountains.
Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars,
But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their cars."

walked up to the window like a nat'ral born man

said I sure do hope that choo-choo train runs on time

well, these two dollar shoes, Lord, they hurt my feet,

but that fifty-cent liquor, well it could not be beat

and I see no reason, reason to be sad



'cause I'm goin' where them cold, cold winds don't blow

where the streams and rivers, Lord, they all run slow

ain't no use in cryin', cryin' over what you had

And I've got my scenery set
Right there with a thump our umbrellas gonna bump
And I say, ""Yeah, yeah, pardon me, haven't we met?""

Accidents can happen
And into one I'm gonna slide
There's a good chance to get my hands
On a little romance when two hearts collide

And I know that's just how it happened
When Romeo met Juliet
Somewhere I've read that old Romeo said
""Pardon me, haven't we met?""

Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes?

Yesterday's papers telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

In the all night café at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the metal ribbons that he wears?
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind"

But the warrior is forgot

He may laugh at all The weathered storms Friendly with the sun 
That gives him warmth Alone but free
He's a memory
Past is the pride
That's his company"

Senza una ragione ne' un motivo, senza niente
Ti senti un nodo nella gola, ti senti un buco nello stomaco
Ti senti un vuoto nella testa e non capisci niente
E non ti basta più un amico e non ti basta più distrarti

E non ti basta bere da ubriacarti
E non ti basta ormai più niente
E in fondo pensi, ci sarà un motivo
E cerchi a tutti i costi una ragione
Eppure non c'e' mai una ragione
Eerché un amore debba finire

E vorresti cambiare faccia, e vorresti cambiare nome
E vorresti cambiare aria, e vorresti cambiare vita
E vorresti cambiare il mondo, ma sai perfettamente
Che non ti servirebbe a niente

Perché c'e' lei, perché c'e' lei
Perché c'e' lei, perché c'e' lei
Perché c'e' lei nelle tue ossa
Perché c'e' lei nella tua mente
Perché c'e' lei nella tua vita
E non potresti più mandarla via

Nemmeno se cambiassi faccia
Nemmeno se cambiassi nome
Nemmeno se cambiassi aria
Nemmeno se cambiassi vita
Nemmeno se cambiasse il mondo
Però, se potessi ragionarci sopra

Saprei perfettamente che domani sarà diverso
Lei non sarà più lei io non sarò lo stesso uomo
Magari l'avrò già dimenticata magari se potessi ragionarci sopra
E se potessi ragionarci sopra ma non posso, perché
Quando finisce un amore"

Turned out to be for real.

For the love you want to give.
I need something in my life to make me want to live.
I'm up in my whole life,
But I think need a change.
I need some sunshine in my life,
I can't stand the rain.

Tell me do, do, do I need you?
Tell me do, do, do I need you?

I don't need no man,
I already know the game.
I need more loving in my life
To chase away the pain.
You might be good to me,
And I might be good to you.
I don't need nobody that can't be true.

Tell me do, do, do I need you?

To see us play our parts
We hoped you'd lend an ear,
You hoped we'd dress like tarts
But back stage we stand naked
All the make-up cleaned away,
My poet sheds his pretty skin
And turns to face the day

And there's nothing to be done,
No nothing to be said,
Last night I felt immortal,
This morning I feel dead

And the love
That gave its blaze to my heart,
Now brings a haze
Be careful 'cause I'm an axe victim,
Hung up on these silver strings,
Like wings,
Like time machines...
Like voices on the winds

We hit the road to home,
Sad amps and smashed guitars,
Played badly at 'The Duke' to almost
no applause...
But someone made it worthwhile
When smiling with bright eyes,
They gave me full attention
And took me by surprise...

Today the feeling's gone.
It faded like a ghost,
Last night I saw the future,
This morning there's no hope

And the words that I sung so clear
Are now clouded by my tears
Please be careful
'Cause I'm an axe victim,
Hung up on these silver strings,
Like sails,
Like seagull's cries
Like churchbells in the night"

And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me 
As I sit on the edge of a dream 
What do I see?  What do I see? 

I see the children playing in the sun 
And there is love enough for each and everyone 
As I sit on the edge of a dream 
That's what I see!  That's what I see! 

Things that might be, if we look we just might see 
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring 

Merry-go-round without a sound 
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me 
As I sit on the edge of a dream 
What do I see?  What do I see? 

I see the Lord inside of everyone 
Can it be my dream will really come 
As I sit on the edge of a dream 
That's what I see!  That's what I see! 

Things that might be, if we look we just might see 
Paint the world so brightly, let our freedom ring

Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun

Then tracks were lain across the plain
By broken old men in torrid rains
The towns grew up and the people were still

Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun

We all joined in and all joined hands
All joined in to help run this land
Then soldiers came, long long ago
Rode through the town and rode down those who were

Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun
Sleeping in the midday sun

Gold came and went, quickly spent
And the people broke down and often drowned
In the wealth and pain of old Abilene

And it hurts her now that no one comes to see her. 

She used to go to parties and a-dancing with her beau.
Beneath the southern moon they found their places.
But now she's tired all the time and she got no where to go,
And the memories keep showing up in faces. 

So she finds her dressing table and she puts on all of her clothes,
And she cries when she's realized she's just an old Rose. 

Rose walks to the kitchen then she fills her coffee cup.
And thinks of how the mornings used to greet her.
But now it's just another day and harder to get up,
And it breaks her heart to think that no one needs her. 

And she wants to start all over but she ain't got far to go,
So she cries when she's realized she's just an old Rose.

But your off-stage ways might be a bore -
You take a bow, you take a fall.

There's no longer magic in your eyes.

I came to be here in the footlights,
To live with you through every song,
And your face displays a peaceful field.

It's getting late
It's now or never
Don't hesitate or stall
When I call
Don't spoil
The thrill of it all
And before you go to sleep at night
Preying shadows - do they ask you why?
And in the morning through the afternoon
Do you wonder where you're going to?
Every word I use
Each crumpled page
Strange ideas
Mature with age
Like leaves
When autumn falls
Turn gold
Then they hit the ground
Every time I hear
The latest sound
It's pure whiskey
Reeling round and around
My brain
Oh and all o' that jive
It's driving me wild -
The dizzy spin I'm in
Everywhere I look
I see your face
I hear your name
It's all over the place
Hey girl
Though you've gone
Still I recall
The trill of it all
You might as well know what is right for you
And make the most of what you like to do
For all the pleasure that's surrounding you
Should compensate for all you're going through
So if you're feeling fraught
With mental strain
Too much thinking's got you down again
Well let your senses skip
Stay hip
Keep cool
To the thrill of it all
When you try too much
You lose control
Pressure rises
And so I'm told
Something's got the give
Oy Veh
High life ecstasy
You might as well live
I can't see
I can't speak
I couldn't take more than another week
Without you - oh no
So I will drink my fill

Oh the thrill of it all
Oh the thrill of it all
No I won't forget

E' per lei, io vedo quella ferrovia
Che è fra i sassi, la mia via
Nel passato e nel presente corre già.

E vanno indietro gli anni miei
Che si fermano con lei
E la mente mia non hai lasciato mai.

Tutto a posto lo so, tutto a posto perché
Quello che lasciai ancora c'è,
Le colline più in là, e la strada che va
So che fino a lei mi porterà

Sono arrivato,
La notte azzurra intorno a me
Luglio fra quei rami e
Il profumo dell'estate ancora c'è

E qualche passo ancora e poi
So che mi preparerà
Una cena calda, il fuoco accenderà

C'è silenzio fra noi,
Guardo negli occhi suoi
E capisco la mia ingenuità.

Tutto a posto lo so,
Tutto a posto perché
Tutto è come quando me ne andai
Tranne lei...

Ma tutto è a posto oramai
Anche se ho capito che
Il mio posto nel suo mondo più non c'è...

There were times seemed just like the walls would crumble 
Shoot from the hip and pray for trouble 
Stone-cold sober and a-seeing double 
How that midnight band could ramble 
Taking mansions and leaving shambles 

Remember other times and places 
Last night's dance, the glowing faces 
All the lights, the shadows in the hall 
Seeking higher peaks from which to fall 

Remember, we were telling you 
That time would stop and nations fall 
Now we find the lies come true 
Can you tell me, tell me, tell me 
What are we to do? 

Because the good old days 
Those good old days are all dead and gone 
Good-bye and bless them all, every one

309,Rino Gaetano,Ad Esempio A Me Piace Il Sud,TRJAZWQ128F4296A93,1974,"Ad esempio a me piace la strada
col verde bruciato, magari sul tardi
macchie più scure senza rugiada
coi fichi d'India e le spine dei cardi
Ad esempio a me piace vedere
la donna nel nero nel lutto di sempre
sulla sua soglia tutte le sere
che aspetta il marito che torna dai campi
Ma come fare non so
Si devo dirlo ma a chi
Se mai qualcuno capirà
sarà senz'altro un altro come me
Ad esempio a me piace rubare
le pere mature sui rami se ho fame
e quando bevo sono pronto a pagare
l'acqua, che in quella terra è più del pane
Camminare con quel contadino
Che forse fa la stessa mia strada
parlare dell'uva, parlare del vino
che ancora è un lusso per lui che lo fa
Ad esempio a me piace per gioco
tirar dei calci a una zolla di terra
passarla a dei bimbi che intorno al fuoco
cantano giocano e fanno la guerra
Poi mi piace scoprire lontano
il mare se il cielo è all'imbrunire
seguire la luce di alcune lampare
e raggiunta la spiaggia mi piace dormire"
310,Brian Eno,Fat Lady Of Limbourg (2004 Digital Remaster),TRWAGTD128F425EDDD,1974,"Well, I rang up Pantucci,
Spoke to Lu-chi,
I gave them all
They needed to know.
If affairs are proceeding
As we're expecting,
Soon enough the weak spots will show.
I assume you understand that we have options on your time,
And will ditch you in the harbour if we must:
But if it all works out nicely,
You'll get the bonus you deserve
From doctors we trust.

The Fat Lady of Limbourg
Looked at the samples that we sent
And furrowed her brow.
You would never believe that
She'd tasted royalty and fame
If you saw her now.
But her sense of taste is such that she'll distinguish with her tongue
The subtleties a spectrograph would miss,
And announce her decision,
While demanding her reward:
The jellyfish kiss.

Now we checked out this duck quack
Who laid a big egg, oh so black
It shone just like gold.
And the kids from the city,
Finding it pretty, took it home,
And there it was sold.
It was changing hands for weeks till someone left it by their fire
And it melted to a puddle on the floor:
For it was only a candle, a Roman scandal oh oh oh,
Now it's a pool.
That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for here."

Cause we're gonna do the town tonight
Well I'm comin' into town and right on time I still got your lovin' on my mind

I'm a coming home I gotta make some love
I'm a coming home sweet turtle dove
I'm a coming home to make sweet love to you

Well I see down the road there's a big truck stop
They got a pretty little waitress with the carrot top
She's pretty as a doll pretty as can be
But don't you worry honey she ain't nothin' to me

I'm a coming home I gotta make some love
I'm a coming home sweet turtle dove
I'm a coming home to make sweet love to you

Well I came to a hill and the truck looked down
Throwed in low and she's huggin' the ground
Scratchin' gears but I'm goin' again I'm comin' home baby I'm doggin' it in

I'm a coming home I gotta make some love
I'm a coming home sweet turtle dove
I'm a coming home to make sweet love to you

When I've got nothing to do
Something to me
Might mean nothing to you

So don't don't don't don't
Look at me strangely now
We'll find the line
That's in the middle and run

Something, something or nothing

You say you love to spend days
But I will save mine
Waiting for the sun in your eyes
To turn the river to wine

This is for all the single people
Thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up until you
Drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home

Never give you up
You'll never know until you try

315,Reinhard Mey,Mein Testament,TRTPSYL128F1465F7C,1974,"In Erwartung jener Stunde, die man halt nicht vorher kennt
Nehm' ich mir Papier und Feder und beginn mein Testament
Schreibe meinen letzten Willen, doch ich hoffe sehr dabei
Dass der Wille, den ich schreibe, doch noch nicht mein letzter sei
Aber für den Fall der Fälle halte ich ihn schon bereit
Dabei täte mir der Fall der Fälle ausgesprochen leid

Meinen Nachlass zu verwalten, geb' ich dir allein Vollmacht
So weiß ich, dass mit dem Nachlass keiner keinen Unfug macht
Geh' zunächst zum Biergroßhändler, der schon schluchzt und lamentiert
Weil er mit mir eine Stütze seines Umsatzes verliert
Schenk' ihm all die leeren Flaschen, die bei uns im Keller steh'n
Mit dem schönen Posten Leergut wird es ihm schon besser geh'n

Was danach an guten vollen Flaschen noch im Keller ist
Die vermach' ich Euch, Ihr Freunde, die Ihr sie zu schätzen wisst
Als Dank für die guten Stunden, die Ihr mir gegeben habt
Als Dank dafür, dass Ihr heut' noch hinterm schwarzen Wagen trabt
Ich vermach' Euch Fass und Flaschen, euch zum Wohle, mir zum Trost
Ich hätt' gerne mitgetrunken, leider geht's nicht, na denn Prost

Alles, was ich an irdischen Gütern habe, Hund und Haus
Vermach' ich dir, meine Freundin, mache du das Beste draus
Und erscheinen dir die Räume plötzlich viel zu eng und klein
Öffne den Freunden die Türen, und das Haus wird größer sein
Verschenke, was immer du verschenken willst vom Inventar
Sei mit denen die dich bitten, großzügiger, als ich es war

Meine Träume, meine Ziele, sind bei dir in guter Hand
Die, die ich so gut geliebt hab', wie ich es nun mal verstand
Ich wollte die Welt verbessern, ohne viel Erfolg scheint mir
Mach du, wo ich aufhör', weiter, und vielleicht gelingt es dir
Das wird dich darüber trösten, wenn ich nicht mehr bei dir wohn'
Dann werd' wieder die Glücklichste, die Schönste bist du ja schon

Meine Verse, meine Lieder, gehör'n dir ja ohnehin
Die, die mich so sehr geliebt hat, mehr vielleicht, als ich's verdien'
Denn durch dich hab' ich, wenn heut' schon meine letzte Stunde kommt
Viel mehr als nur jenen Teil vom Glück gehabt, der mir zukommt
So bedaur' ich eine in jener Stunde nur, dass offenbar
Uns das Los von Philemon und Baucis nicht beschieden war

Aber eines freut mich doch, wenn ich heut' sterbe, ungeniert
Hab' ich meine Widersacher doch noch einmal angeschmiert
Denn ich hör' die Lästermäuler Beileid heucheln und sogar
Murmeln, dass ich stets der Beste, Liebste, Allergrößte war
Euch, Ihr Schleimer, hinterlass' ich frohen Herzens den Verdruss
Dass man von dem frisch Gestorb'nen immer Gutes sagen muss

Mein Vermächtnis ist geschrieben, klaren Kopfes bis zuletzt
Ich lass' noch Platz für das Datum, den Rest unterschreib' ich jetzt
Dieses ist mein letzter Wille, doch ich hoffe sehr dabei
Dass der Wille, den ich schreibe, doch noch nicht mein letzter sei
Wär er's doch, schreib' auf den Grabstein, den ich mir noch ausbeding':
""Hier liegt einer, der nicht gerne, aber der zufrieden ging"""
316,Sparks,Barbecutie,TRANSZZ128F9305B83,1974,"For the sake of man
He has forsaken his whole tan
Living in the snow
Advancing how much we will know
But his heart cries out

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie
When you're with him he is warm 

Let's pursue this more
Why would he leave so much that's warm
To his detriment
Maybe he's oh so slightly bent
Ask her, she would know

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you,
Barbecutie
When you're with him he is warm

The friends are getting friendly on the lawn
The flies are making enemies of all
Aroma rising from the ancient coals
Have turned you into someone very bold
And killed whatever hesitance she showed

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you,
You, you, you

Though he's back unharmed
He must defrost his frozen charm
""How are you today""
That's very good, he's on his way
To the Barbecue

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you
Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie you."

Says ""Willie's done quite a job""
Hitler's on the phone from Berlin
Says ""I'm gonna make you a star""

My Captain Von Ondine is your next patrol
A flight of English bombers across the canal
After twelve they'll all be here
I think you know the job

They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers are ripe and ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die

In a G-load disaster from the rate of climb
Sometimes I'd faint and be lost to our side
But there's no reward for failure - but death
So watch me in mirrors keep in the glidepath

Get me through these radars, no, I cannot fail
While my great silver slugs are eager to feed
I can't fail - no, not now
When twenty five bombers wait ripe

They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers are ripe and ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die

ME-262 prince of turbojet
Junker's Jumo 004
Blasts from clustered R4M quartets in my snout
And see these English planes go burn

Well, you be my witness, how red were the skies
When the fortresses flew for the very last time
It was dark over Westphalia
In April of '45

They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers are ripe and ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die

Must these Englishmen live that I might die...

With your old hurdy gurdy and no one to meet
You say love ain't the same on the south side of town

vull que el dia sigui net i clar,
que cap ocell
trenqui l'harmonia del seu cant.

Que tinguis sort
i que trobis el que t'ha mancat
en mi.

Si em dius ""et vull"",
que el sol faci el dia molt més llarg,
i així, robar
temps al temps d'un rellotge aturat.

Que tinguem sort,
que trobem tot el que ens va mancar
ahir.

I així pren tot el fruit que et pugui donar
el camí que, a poc a poc, escrius per a demà.
Què demà mancarà el fruit de cada pas;
per això, malgrat la boira, cal caminar.

Si véns amb mi,
no demanis un camí planer,
ni estels d'argent,
ni un demà ple de promeses, sols
un poc de sort,
i que la vida ens doni un camí
ben llarg."
