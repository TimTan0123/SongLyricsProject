0,Greg Dulli,Wicked,TRHNNZG128F4265177,2005,"This world is wicked
I fit right in
We've been waiting for you, boy
Where you been?
 
I don't need no one to love me
I don't need no one to fetch my water
Come on get your money, child
It's a fine, fine day

I don't love you any more
Baby
Snap my crooked fingers
And you blow away

Say you want someone to love you
Say you want a fleeting memory
Come a little closer
Things ain't what they seem to be

Believe
What you see
Nothing else
Even dreams
I can't breathe
I can't see
I feel love
I feel love

This world is wicked
It's beautiful
You better play both sides
Or they'll think you an animal

Come on get your money, baby
Come on get your one time, one time
Come on get your loving, girl
It's a fine, fine day"
1,Cazals,Poor Innocent Boys,TRWKIWW128F933C88C,2005,"You really let the family down
You almost ruined their name
Your father's so disappointed
Your sister feels the same

And now the neighbors are talking
Eyes down underneath their breathe
Your mother I swear you've done this
She says she's got nothing left

Why can't you just be normal
Another link in the chain
I pull you away like your father
Not likely were not the same

*Chorus*
'Cuz were poor innocent boys
Poor poor
Innocent boys
Poor innocent boys
Poor poor
Innocent boys
Poor innocent boys
Poor poor
Innocent boys
Poor innocent boys
A tribulation radio station boy

Do you notice something missing
When the kids at play
Turn to be the doorman x
Set it up and play
All I've got is vices knocking at my door
All the angry taxman asking me for more     
I've got something to say
All in a matter of time
Please don't get in my way 
'Cuz everything is mine.

*Chorus*x2"
2,The Beta Band,Dog's Got A Bone,TRQPRGT128E0782B59,2005,"Dog's got a bone, all of his own 
Wednesday morning, middle of the road 
Can't help this feeling, of feeling so alone 
Gotta go home now, dog's got a bone now. 

Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see that we are (climbing/gliding) 
Listen you will see that we are climbing 

Wish you were here, tied to the pier 
Words disappear, every time you call me 
So won't you come home now 
If you're feling so alone now 
Dog's got a bone, all of his own now 

Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see that we are (climbing/gliding) 
Listen you will see that we are climbing 
Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see, coming on in to me 
Listen you will see that we are (climbing/gliding) 
Listen you will see that we are climbing 
...yeh, do-do-do-do... 

Falling on your face with a little white"
3,Garbage,Bleed Like Me,TRIQJQL128E078D9B8,2005,"Avalanche is sullen and too thin
She starves herself to rid herself of sin
And the kick is so divine when she sees bones beneath her skin
And she says:
Hey baby can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby can you bleed like me

Chris is all dressed up and acting coy
Painted like a brand new Christmas toy
He's trying to figure out if he's a girl or he's a boy
And he says:
Hey baby can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby can you bleed like me

Doodle takes Dad's scissors to her skin
And when she does relief comes setting in
While she hides the scars she's making underneath her pretty clothes
She sings:
Hey baby can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby can you bleed like me

Therapy is Speedie's brand new drug
Dancing with the devil's past has never been too fun
It's better off than trying to take a bullet from a gun
And she cries:
Hey baby can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby can you bleed like me

JT gets all fucked up in some karaoke bar
After two drinks he's a loser after three drinks he's a star
Getting all nostalgic as he sings ""I Will Survive""
Hey baby can you bleed like me?
C'mon baby can you bleed like me

You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars
You should see my scars

And try to comprehend that which you'll never comprehend"

5,Fozzy,Daze Of The Weak,TRKBZVH128F424B2F2,2005,"Lightning strikes turning ashes to embers
Starting the fire ignites the fuel I bring
Burning ambition will give me protection
Reach for the ring and you will be the King
The King!

This iron will is my constant companion
Battle is over my strength inside is strong
Whispered memories of a failure abandoned
All that I am screams that this all wrong

Lord hear my plea, when will it be
Time for me to see You clearly?
Walk in a daze


And weak with pain
Carry me back to life again

A lifetime of cheap whine will not improve your station
The tempest to be best will prove the others fake
One man accuses another defends me
A delicate balance of hope and heartache

What is the ally that gives you the green light?
What is the secret to take you to the peak?
Where is your shaman to give you the magic?
And when will you realize He's all you seek?"
6,Houston Calls,Sunrise Goodbyes,TRALWBG128F427D1F5,2005,"Amidst a smile like the setting sun
Red sequined dress that could kill anyone
The music moves you like good poetry
I wish I lacked this anonymity
It strikes me funny when you mouth the words
to ""Am I Wrong"" a song I've only heard 
while sipping whiskey living out a lie
a perfect portrait hosting you and I

[Chorus]
A made up romance, my soliloquy will read
I know I'm lost again, my timing's off again
because something lacks in your passing eyes
It's lust and libido
why give up this opportunity?
Give it a go and maybe you will see
so take a chance it'll be alright
and that's all you've got to go on

You dance around my head throughout the day
a want, a wish, a will to have my way
and when I fumble over words you smile
you'll kiss my cheek and say, ""I like your style.""

Dream a dream of our life story
I will tell it over and again 
I'll tell the world just how you got that
got that perfect smile I can't withstand 
Let me kiss your index finger 
I'll point out how you've made me crazy 
I know I'd do it all the same way
I'd do it all the same

[Chorus]

Dream a dream of our life story
I will tell it over and again 
I'll tell the world just how you got that
Let me kiss your index finger 
I'll point out how you've made me crazy 
I know I'd do it all the same way

[Chorus]

Why give up this opportunity?
If I can't be near you then I'd rather be
in hell forever I'll think of you
so just give me chances to go on"
7,Paul Weller,Paper Smile,TRMRHEB128F931E449,2005,"Paper Smile

What's in a life
If you don't live it, baby
It's just getting on by
With a promise, what if, maybe

Hanging around
Waiting for something to fall
And once in a while
The paper smile must come a-way
What's in a life
If you don't live it, baby

What's in a kiss
If you can't feel it, baby
The lips maybe sweet
But are they sweet enough to contain it

You're wasting your time
Hanging out of windows painting
And once in a while
The paper smile must come and go

And where it blows
Who knows
And where it goes
It goes
I'm glad to see it go
I'm glad to see it go

And what's in a dream
If you can't be it, baby

Look away, you're painted smile
Look away, you're painted smile
Wipe away your painted smile
Wipe away your painted smile
Look away you're painted smile
Wipe away your painted smile
Painted smile, painted smile
Painted smile, painted smile"

She's crying

He's the one who leaves you high and dry
You know this
It takes six seconds on all sides
You know him
He'll compromise your alibi
You know him
He'll make you feel like you cannot survive

Totally sadistic
Won't tolerate submissive
Never underestimate his drive
Couldn't see him coming
You're walking, but he's running
You'll be catching up for miles

I was trained to beat you
I couldn't get past you
But can I outlast?
I couldn't outlast you
You shouldn't be here
But look what I can do
Don't show me something
Unless it's something new

11,Bananarama,Don't Step On My Groove,TRLALKR128F1452C85,2005,"It's so electric here tonight
And so I'm heading out for the city life
I feel connected and it feels so right
Hear the sounds
All around, all around 

Got no time to hesitate
If you're with me don't be late
Coz I Wanna dance 

(chorus) 
Don't step on my groove
Coz I just wanna move
I don't care what you do
But don't step on my groove 

I'm captivated, every time
Looking pretty and I'm running wild
There's nothing like it
When you lose your mind
To the sounds
All around, all around 

(chorus) 

I just keep dancing (x4)"
12,Weezer,The Damage In Your Heart,TRMFYRW128F425C1C8,2005,"One more time
I have crossed the line
Now you won't be mine
Anymore

One more dream
Vanished up in smoke
Now I have no hope
Anymore

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much
To the world

One more loss
In a losing life
Doesn't hurt so bad
Anymore

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much
To the world

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I cant tell you
I cant tell you
I cant tell you
How the words have made me feel"
13,Porcupine Tree,Deadwing (Album Version),TRKZRJV128E078BDF9,2005,"And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifled through the grey and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare
In the dentist's chair
Sucking in the air
Wire across the stair
Kicking down the door
At your local store
With the world at war
Voices through the floor
Unexpected news
Wearing high heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse
Paying all your dues
Deadwing lullaby
Like a fracture tied
It's a worthless lie
To the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity

Yes I'd have to say I like my privacy
And did you know you're on closed circuit TV?
So smile at me

And a dream you had
Of your mum and dad
On a beach somewhere
And the poison air
With the cancer threat
In a cigarette
Deadwing lullaby
Find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A spectre from the next life breathes his fog on the pane
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for her name

And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through"
14,Mystery Jets,On My Feet,TRTYTTE128E078B763,2005,"Get me, on my feet

Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 
Get me, on my feet 

You get me 
On my feet 
So tomorrow 
Never comes 

All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah! 

Two more to my thoughts do tell 
Two more to my thoughts do tell 

All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased 
All our yesteryears 
Will be erased"
15,Lonestar,What's Wrong With That,TRVRBBS128F42AFA23,2005,"When we punch out at four o'clock,
Some of the boys down at the shop,
Like to stop at Mojo's an' have a beer or two.
They laugh an' make jokes at my expense,
'Cause I go home instead of joinin' in,
But I got other things I like to do, yes I do.
Now I'm not sayin' I'm better than them,
But where they're goin', I've already been.

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me,
Three little angels, cute as can be.
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat.
When the thunder rolls like thunder can,
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in,
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

I used to drwam of bein' rich,
While shovelling mud in a rain-soaked ditch.
My boots had busted laces an' worn out soles.
I used to hang out with the party crowd,
An' drank more beer than the law allowed,
But that feels like a whole other life ago.
Sometimes we still live hand-to-mouth,
But I got more blessin's than I count.

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me,
Three little angels, cute as can be.
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat.
When the thunder rolls like thunder can,
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in,
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

It took some time an' a lot of pain,
To fin'lly figure out,
I can live without anything,
Except what's in that house.

I got a good woman at home waitin' for me,
Three little angels, cute as can be.
A couple of dogs an' one little calico cat.
When the thunder rolls like thunder can,
Got a king-size bed we can all fit in,
An' the key to happiness under my doormat:
What's wrong with that?

(Got a good woman at home waitin' for me.)
Yeah, yeah, what's wrong with that.
(Three little angels, cute as can be.)
Oh, oh, what's wrong with that?
(What's wrong with that?)
Someone tell me, whoo:
Absolutely nothin'!"
16,Maximilian Hecker,Lady Sleep,TRFWIDN128F9338DEB,2005,"Lady Sleep, please kiss me sweetly
Throw me in a wad of cotton wool
And close my eyes, so I can see

Will you breast-feed with bewitching silence
Treat me like I was your only son
And love me like there was no morning?

You unfaithful lover
Careless mother 
Cheating angel
Cause you always leave me after some time

So lustrously and disinfected
I'll be diving into you
When, eventually, will you stay forever?"
17,Gravenhurst,Nicole,TRBCWRP128F92FF6F4,2005,"Find me the captain
Tell him i want to know
Just who is steering and who's merely holding on
And when the next wave is the last wave
I'll drag him downwards to the engine room
And never let go
Oh nicole
From the moment we met we let it get out of control
The universal dance
The black romance of running prey
The slowing down
The giving in
The final give away
I cry for mercy
You stare back blankly
I want to jump but if you're pushing me
I'll hold on tightly"
18,Fun Lovin' Criminals,City Boy,TRKXOBO12903CCB7AB,2005,"Like Magellan we was over by my man catchin' paper. 
Frankie on the cubes. And fisty on the sabre i 
was on the mix mad drinkin that is when i found all 
these locals all up in my biz. See i had to do some 
splainin cause the language they was playin wasn't 
NewYorkese. Or for that spanglish even. I walked up 
to the man with the largest of hands, cold briefed 
him on the plan, turned around and sang... 
I'm a city boy. Baby 
Don't you ever try to play me 
Sometimes i act real crazy. 
But i'm a city boy. Baby 
You know they always like a story down on flatbush ave i remembered when i listened and we stole what we had. If America's a tit then New York is the nipple. So suck on this and you may learn a little... The golden rule's for fools or for men who are righteous so piay the cards you're 
dealt. And maybe you might just slide on by with no damage to your pride. 
Go let ignorance be your guide.

19,The Donnas,Everyone Is Wrong,TRWLZPB128F92F6EF8,2005,"Don't look at me and say my name
And try to tell me it's all the same
Take a song and make it all wrong
Then expect us to get along

Well I know something you don't know
(You don't know)

Well I knew it all along
That a song just ain't a song anymore
Guess I know where I belong
Go tell everybody that
Everyone is wrong

Now you want us to sing for you
Don't you know that's not what we do?
Make it up and pretend your right
So you'll come to the show tonight

Well I know something you don't know
(You don't know)

Well I knew it all along
That a song just ain't a song anymore
Guess I know where I belong
Go tell everybody that
Everyone is wrong

Since when am I your new best friend?
You wanna buy me a drink?
I'd rather have it in ink

If I don't laugh and make you look good
And talk about your morning wood
Ride off, my sweat and years
Cause your busy with your beers

Now I know something you don't know
(You don't know)

Well I knew it all along
That a song just ain't a song anymore
Guess I know where I belong
Go tell everybody that everyone is wrong

So you think that you can ruin me?
That part got through to me
Go tell everybody that everyone
Is wrong"
20,Larrikin Love,Happy As Annie (Master - Album Version),TRXBKVQ128F1482B6E,2005,"&lt;On September 3rd 2003&gt; I was softly touched by a warm summer breeze
There were blue tits flocking and swerving
My accuracy is quite unnerving

I stole into a burnt, orange field
Which once was green, but lost its zeal
To prance and dance and sing around
Which is not condoned in the centre of town

Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear

And as I crunched those crispy leaves
I walked towards a shaded tree
To find a young girl lying there
Drifting off without a care

Her face was covered by a straw hat
'Happy as Larry' and all of that
When I shouted out to wake her up
She was skipping school in the burning hot

Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear

And as I tried to get her to speak
I realised that she was not asleep
I moved her hat to find that her face was grey
Her knickers wrapped around her ankles
It's not funny!

Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Children please beware!
I'm choked with fear
Oh children please beware!
I'm choked with fear

Swamped with fear...
Drown in fear..."
21,Micatone,Out Of The Game,TRGSGUC128F427E81C,2005,"High above the land
You asked me for my hand
You even brought the ring
Champagne and everything
A ring of your own design
A ring that shimmered and shined
You told me you will be mine
No matter what I decide

And I thought
No no no no no no no no no
Let me go let me go let me go

I'm out of the game
Honey I feel the shame
But you know I can't be tamed
You're not the one to blame
I think I'm out of the game

I said I need some time
Until I will decide
But I all I wanted was hide
From being your future bride
You're not the one to blame
Baby I feel the shame
But you know I can't be tamed

I'm out of the game
Honey I feel the shame
But you know I can't be tamed
You're not the one to blame

Yo we should have a freestyle track on this
Hit 'em off with something
Spit a verse, Travis, spit a verse
Quit picking your nose
Fuck you, I'll kill it, I don't give a fuck

Traded in my hollow words for jelly filled verbs and five pound pronouns and predicates
This is Schlep's etiquette for sloppy fable manners, get your napkins
Matty do kick the beat and I'm rappin
Top of the line top of the world top of the mornin' to ya top dog that's a top notch tie you got
Tie it in a knot till your eyeballs pop out
So you can actually see what an actual emcee looks like
And if I had to pick and choose
I'd be the indecisive dick in the voting booth
Laughing at my options like
Stop the press and warn the media
Schleprok is leavin' ya
Walking with prosthetic concoctions
I thought I told you
You just a toadstool on Mario with firepowers stickin' dick to the princess
Is just senseless
Like that David and Goliath drama
Mine is the slingest
Don't get basically defenseless
Anyway ya wanted Schleprok's cock's obnoxious
It feels like a midget is chillin' in my boxers
What?
I'm sorry
I don't even give a fuck"
23,Facto Delafe y las flores azules,Enero en la playa,TRRRCPB128F427BA38,2005,"Y tu piel es blanca como esta mañana de enero demasiado hermosa como para ir a trabajar. Sin pestañear hablamos con el jefe un cuento chino y, como niños, nos volvemos a acostar. Se supone que debía ser fácil ¿Tienes frío? Pero a veces lo hago un poco difícil. Perdón. Suerte que tú ríes y no te enfadas porque eres más lista y menos egoísta que yo ¿Todavía tienes frío? Bueno, cierra los ojos un minuto que te llevo a un lugar.

Imagina una calita, yo te sirvo una clara. Es verano y luce el sol, es la costa catalana. Estamos tranquilos, como anestesiados. Después del gazpacho nos quedamos dormidos mirando el Tour de Francia en la típica etapa donde Lance gana imponiéndose al sprint con un segundo de ventaja en el último suspiro colgándose a sus hombros el maillot amarillo. De nuevo al chiringuito, un bañito, un helado de pistacho y un partido al futbolín. Lanzamos unos frisbis, jugamos a las cartas y acabamos cenando sardinas y ensalada. Bebemos, dorados. Hablamos, callados. La luna, la sal, tus labios mojados. Me entra la sed y pido una copa y España se queda en cuartos en la Eurocopa.

Pero nos da igual, hoy ganaremos el Mundial. Subimos a casa, hacemos el amor y sudamos tanto que nos deshidratamos. El tiempo se para, el aire no corre. Mosquitos volando y grillos cantando y tú a mi lado muriendo de sueño. Cansada, contenta, me pides un cuento y yo te lo cuento, más bien me lo invento. Te explico que un niño cruzó el universo montado en un burro con alas de plata buscando una estrella llamada Renata que bailaba salsa con un asteroide llamado Julián Rodríguez de Malta. Malvado, engreído, traidor y forajido. Conocido bandido en la vía láctea por vender estrellas independientes a multinacionales semiespaciales. Y te duermes

Vivan las noches. El sol, la sal en tus labios. (x5)

Al principio, como siempre, dormimos abrazados y cuando ya suspiras me retiro a mi espacio. Me gusta dormir solo a tu lado de la cama, de esta cama ahora repleta de mantas en esta mañana fría, fría, fría, congelada, congelada."

I'm the lock, you're the key
You're the air, the air, I breathe
But tonight I'm choking

You ... are ... my ... life ...
You ... are ... my ... life ...

You, you're the sea
I'm the waves crashing
I'm the ground
The ground under your feet
I'm a liar, a thief
And I, am an apology

You ... are ... my ... life ...
You ... are ... my ... life ...

You ... are ... my ... life ...

25,Shelby Lynne,Iced Tea,TRGNUYK128E0789AF2,2005,"You look like an art piece floating in my mind
And I am told fortunes are gold
Fortunes are gold.
Bucket loads of gratitude I feel for you
You are fine. I pour you like wine, pour you like wine.

As the desert sky turns into shadow light
Beside me on my bed tonight
Your love is the only light I see
You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown
Tonight.

You seem like a memory that I've always known
And it has shown as long as I go, long as I go.
Safe and lost forever in a fantasy
Tosses and turns. My heart never yearns. My heart never yearns.

There's no better place to be than in your eyes.
There's no other sight to see
You're the cornbread and iced tea of life.

You feel like the only home I've ever known
And I am shown tonight
Oh how I'm shown
Goodnight."
26,Houston Calls,High Rise,TRJJPPM128F427D207,2005,"I'll save this for late night
a cup of coffee and a long walk through the park
down from this rooftop I see the pond and the great lawn through the dark
just when should I tell you?
that's always been the toughest part
I know how it ends but not how it starts

[Chorus]
So this is how I choose to bring this around
an that's all for now
I'm running out of time, just tell me how to make this right
because I'm sick of planning ways to make you mine
recounting all the lines I'd give to your expectant eyes
but I failed to see the signs

It's not the first time that my thoughts would get the best of me
so I'll keep to myself, and just keep on thinking wishfully
I know that this won't help 
I need to say this to your face
We both know this talk won't take place

[Chorus]

Don't bother to tell me 
this time I can see in your eyes
that I'm caught between perfect lies and an impossible dream

Just tell me how to make this right
because I'm sick of planning ways to make you mine
recounting all the lines I'd give to your expectant eyes
but I failed to see the signs

They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&amp;R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)

How to throw an elbow or a fist 
A spitting world of hit and miss 
A violent kiss of that and this 

But hold on, hold on 
I'll never be quite punk enough 
Hold on, hold on 
I'll never be quite punk enough for you 

Ever since I first learned how to spit 
I wished I were a punk rock kid, a punk rock kid 
I never really knew quite what to do 
I'll never be as punk as you 
As punk as you, as punk as you

As he turned the corner

I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do

Comparing each man with you
Knowing they just won't do
They're not you

We walked the fairground parking lot
And with our secret handshakes
Sealed the deal completely
But I'm too close to know just what
Will keep Pandora's boxes shut
And so I'll fail you badly
When you really need me

'Cause I don't know
What I should know –
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore

I'll get a pen and make a list
And give you my analysis
But I can't write this story
With a happy ending
Was I the bullet or the gun
Or just a target drawn upon
A wall that you decided
Wasn't worth defending?

And I should know
But I don't know
That I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
No, I can't help you anymore
Anymore
No, I can't help you

'Cause baby, look what I have done
The ruins just go on and on
I've got to let it go now, or it will drag me under

So I can't help you anymore

No time to look back now / the truth we'll never know 
The past we shared is somehow bitter sweet to taste 
Too bad I walked out, but I had no time to waste 

The constant aggravation of two stubborn hearts / one home 
The then the realization I'm your property to own 
The many nights spent fighting have turned both our hearts to stone 
And now it's time to leave to set upon my future alone / 

[Chorus]
BUT NO MATTER HOW LONG 
NO MATTER HOW FAR I GO 
I'LL STILL REMEMBER YOU 
I MISS YOU, I MISS YOU, SO LONG 

I start to choke back on the words I've left unsaid 
But I can't go back with all this fight stuck in my head 
Don't want to cry but I know deep inside my bones 
It coulda worked somehow, but now we'll never know 

Mixed between confusion and the jealousy you've shown 
I found a heart that aches for me with love I've never known 
But many nights spent fighting have turned both our hearts to stone 
So now it's time to leave to set upon my future alone

To wear this special uniform
To join in their company
The best of the best

Always been a believer
In your own capacity
The training never was too hard
No one could break you

Reach out for the stars
Your strong will got you here
You walked a stony way
Without the slightest sign of fear

We're starfighters, fly all day and all night
And all that we see is our cockpit light
We're starfighters and we love it so much
It's our obsession, we have the master's touch

It was an everlasting dream
The last thing you wish to see:
Flying into a supernova
While you are going down"

Sarei lo stesso
Se fossi ancora là.

Non so perché
Stasera penso a te,
Strada fiorita
Della gioventù.

Come vorrei
Essere un albero, che sa
Dove nasce
E dove morirà.

È troppo tardi
Per ritornare ormai,
Nessuno più
Mi riconoscerà.

La sera è un sogno
Che non si avvera mai,
Essere un altro
E, invece, sono io.

Da quella volta
Non ti ho trovato più,
Strada fiorita

Dove nasce
E dove morirà.

Y hay mujeres que no lloran
Hay fantasmas que rescatar
Y hay quien lo tiene todo
Y no tiene salvación
Y hay quien estando solo
Solo quiere recordar

Y todo te da igual, te da igual
Y todo te da igual, te da igual

El hambre esta cobrando vidas
Habrá santuarios y redención 
Mañana estará en la cárcel 
Quien defienda la verdad
Esa verdad que duele
Es la forma de combatir

Y habrá quien de la nada
Vuelva justo al poder

With red gold shined his weed.
By him stood a little page boy,
Dressing a milk-white steed.
""I fear for you my master,
For your fame it waxes wide.
It is not for your rich-rich gold,
Nor for your mickle pride,
But all is for another Lord's lady,
That lives on the Ithan-side.""

""Oh, here's to you my bonny-wee boy,
That I pay meat and fee.
Run you an errand to the Ithan-side,
And run straight home to me.
If you make me this errand run,
It's all against my will,
If you make me this errand run,
I shall do your errand ill.
But I fear no ill of you bonny-boy,
I fear no ill of you,
I fear no ill of my bonny-boy,
for a good bonny-boy are you!""

""Take you here this green mantle,
It's all... (um... sorry...)
Bid her come to the good green wood,
for to talk to Child Morris.
And take you here this shirt of silk,
her own hand sewed the sleeve,
bid her come to the good green wood,
and ask not Bernard's leave.""

But when he got to the castle wall,
They were playing at the ball.
Four and twenty ladies gay,
Looked over the castle wall.
1God make you safe you ladies all,
God make you safe and sure,
But Bernard's lady among you all,
My errand is to her.

""Oh, take you here this green mantle
It's all lined with the freece,
Come you down to the good green wood,
For to talk to Child Morris.
Take you here this shirt of silk,
Your own hand sewed the sleeve.
Come you down to the good green wood,
And ask not Bernard's leave.""

Well, up there spoke a little nurse,
She winked all with her eye.
""Oh welcome, welcome bonny-boy,
With love tidings to me.""
""You lie, You lie, you false nurse,
So loud I hear you lie,
Bernard's lady among you all,
I'm sure you are not she!""

Well up there spoke Lord Bernard,
Behind the door stood he.
""Oh I shall go to the good green wood,
And I'll see who he might be.
Go fetch to me your gowns of silk,
And your petticoats so small!
I will ride to the good green wood,
And I'll try with him a fall.""

Child Morris stood in the good green wood,
And he whistled and he sang.
""I think I see the lady come,
That I have loved so long.""
He's ridden him through the good green wood,
For to help her from her horse,
""Oh no, Oh no,"" cried Child Morris
""No maid was ere so gross!""

""How now, How now, Child Morris?
How now and how do you?
How long have you my lady loved?
This night, come tell to me.""
""When first that I your lady loved,
In green wood among the thyme,
Then she was my first fair love,
Before that she was thine.
When first that I your lady loved,
In green wood among the flowers,
Then she was my first fair love,
Before that she was yours.""

Lord Bernard's taken a long broad-sword,
That he was used to wear.
And he's cut off Child Morris' head,
And he's put it on a spear.
He's cut off Child Morris' head,
And he's put it on a spear.
The soberest boy in all the court,
Child Morris' head did bear.

And he's put it in a broad basin,
And he's carried it through the hall.
He's taken it to his lady's bower,
Saying, ""Lady play at ball,
Play you, Play you, my lady gay,
Play you from here to the bower.
Play you with Child Morris' head,
For he was your paramour.""

""Oh, he was not my paramour,
He was my son indeed.
I got him in my mother's bower,
All in my maiden weed.
I got him in my mother's bower,
With mickle sin and shame,
I brought him up in the good green wood,
All beneath the wind and rain,

""Now I will kiss his bloody cheek,
And I will kiss his chin.
I'll make a vow and I'll keep it true,
I'll never kiss man again.
Oft times I by his cradle sat,
And fond to see him sleep,
Now I'll lie upon his grave,
The salt tears for to weep.""

""Bring pillows for my lady,
She looks so pale and wan.""
""Oh, none of your pillows Lord Bernard,
But lay me on the stone.""
""A pox on you, my lady gay,
That would not tell it to me!
If I'd have known that he was your son,
He'd not have been killed by me!"""

And got the notion together they'd be happy
Thought they'd lose the crowd and do the mess around
Decided to make it snappy
Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate
Now they had another party to lean on
She made him jump and sang, he made her share that thing
Looks like they gonna have a ball
Ain't nothin' wrong at all
Whoa, they gonna have a ball

They got to asking what if they had to scratch-n-sniff
To find out what it is they are after
Got the ants out their pants and took the chance on romance
Made some plans to make it forever
Now several years have gone, they're still gettin' along
They know what true love is made of
Now they know that life's a trip, with all it's bumps and dips
They're gonna help one another along
Nothin' wrong at all
Still havin' a ball
Lord they're really gettin' it on

Time is on their side, they've got nothing to hide
Never had no secrets between them
He don't need to accuse her, use her or abuse her
And she feels the same for him
And those vows they made said nothing about slaves
And didn't mention rentining to own
They can take the stand that walking hand in hand
What they got is gooder than gold
Ain't nothin' wrong at all
Whoa they gonna have a ball
Yeah, they really got it all

Love is true heart's desire without it's just a funeral pyre
Got to let your true love grow, it's all you got that's gooder than gold

Other chicks would say, I can't stand her

She will pull your card, so watch what you say
When she move down the block, you'd think it's ""The Girl from Ipanema""
Brazilian bombshell, keep a forty-fever heater
In the passenger seat of her Beamer
The gangsta lean is not a theater act, she sniff cocallina
Off the triple beam, oh you didn't know she slang big kilos
If she was Corleone, she'd be Vito
She got clout, pull strings like Santana

Speak three languages, she dangerous
Manipulate your mind with crime 'til you pop cannons
Have you thinkin Bonnie &amp; Clyde and then she smooth vanish
I am not an amateur, I seen the whole planet or world
Tours and romance, grown women with pure mouthpiece
I never doubt, see I never underestimate
I keep an open mind and I seen shit that shine
But if life is like a movie script, she kept an uzi with a full clip
At the age of 13, fuckin with kingpins
See I'm not impressed by material things
But she's clearly a queen, so I'm here to explain
I need a chick with, drive and tenacity that has to be
Financially secure for our paths to meet, actually
(what) she's all of the above, don't be all in the club
But her fault is that she in love with drug money
Now she'll rub me funny, really couldn't fuck with honey
Picture us rollin, soldiers start dumpin on me?!
I'ma chill on that cause niggaz'll kill for that
But she's still phenomenal, mahogany brown

You said money can't buy me love and that's true
But money can buy me drugs, so that's cool
The best of the worst, skinhead Rob, one and only, fully loaded
Riding dirty and I'm feeling kinda lonely
Of a wet one, throw back, dip in the fifth
Punch drunk with a pistol, so I'll probably miss
Any chance that I have to turn my house to a home
Time's up, game's over, I'm dying alone

So let the funky beat blaze

Six trey with the USO's
Puffing on the silver black guerrilla
On a Saturday afternoon

For the G's and the harmony

And everyone's a target
And everyone's an enemy

Money and fame, but I don't flaunt it
Walk through the state undaunted
State of California, but the state is haunted

Ain't gonna stop till the early morn
Ain't gonna stop till the break of dawn
I got my crew coming over, now I know it's on

From the land of the lost where the good die young
Got yer son smoked out in the hood buying guns
Not the first or the last time, test me and I'll blast mine
Neighbor versus neighbor and it's killing as a pasttime
I've heard it all before and nope, I'm not buying
The biggest and the baddest get broke, I'm not lying
I could get get it next, you could get it right now

Autumn is winding and leaves are changing color 
No other could have persisted through the winter spring and summer 
To eventually be the bringer of the thunder 
A new comer to life, new year, day seven 
Trembling with a roar for a lifetime more 
Twenty-five percent sent to the lint that falls 
Below ground zero a hero that rarely calls 
The mating tune, the cycle looms 
In the spring with a butterfly and two flowers that bloom 
I sit in the waiting room reading Aristotle and Hume 
Feed the pathways of development so I could consume 
A new tune in June or July the next moon 
Tri-deci the fly messy rhythm of X tunes 
I treck dunes, and catch wasps in my eyebrows 
Hoping that someday as I was born I will die loud 
A lone cloud in the sky dreams in the eye get clearer 
Circular forces force the center ever nearer 
I enter as a steerer of this ship trying another tune 
Spinning around the waiting room 

I stepped into the shoes of the wrong half stepping heathen 
Ask me what I'm believing, ask me who I'm deceiving 
Who's life am I retrieving, karma karma chameleon 
One in a million feeling, steeling my soul asylum 
Prayer for prayers sake a tear drop from wake to wake 
Filling the crying lake passage from state to state 
Ask me who do I hate, evil masters of pergatory 
Tell me the righteous story spiritual holy glory 
After me or before me, everything's honky dory 
Or better yet black and sadness, I had this 
Thought of when I fought demons in my dreaming 
Gleaming like water drops, sin I me's swirling hot 
Blood clots the number seven the reverend told me to stop 
Lying into his eye and today and tomorrow trying 
My mother and sister's crying, why it's because I'm dying 
Soul in the sky I'm flying, angels my body's spying 
Reincarnation, annihilation abomination and God's creation 
Aloe Blacc's the manifestation ready and waiting 
A life's wonder that I stay in, bend down to my knees prayin' 
And then I say Amen 

Sunsets are wondrous aspects of days 
All work no play makes the mind grow old 
Swiftness, I bless like the wind I sway 
I only observe the play never bought nor sold 
Keep it under control or better yet not at all 
I like to watch sunrise get lost in nightfall 
We hear the wolves call at the moon they ball 
And still the babes root for the nectar of breast 
These breaths from my chest must eminate 
No judgment is past in passing I am great 
To none I stand above the motions set sail 
To one I am great, to me I prevail 
From raindrops to hail I flow like hardwater 
Pledge allegiance to past lives tithe my alma mater 
Sever the weak limb and swim like blew thoughts 
Animosity could never win in this battle I fought, I just float on 

Have you seen the sun set, not yet, we're still rising 
Have you seen the sun set, not yet, we're still rising 
Have you seen the sun set, not yet, we're still rising"

Oh Ohhh

Comin' for you
My day done been so crazy
I know you been waitin'
But baby girl it won't be long
'Cause soon I'm coming home
Oh the phones just started ringing
And my boys done got to fightin'
Next thing you know my mama called
Talking bout her car done stalled
I was almost there baby
And the sky just got hazy
Then rain began to fall
Then Grandma start going off
But I swear I'm comin' baby
I'm so sorry to keep you waitin'
You just keep holding on
Sleet, hail or snow
I want you know to know

Im comin' for you
Get that love ready
Hold steady

Hold steady

Now the po's done pulled me over
But I swear girl I was sober
See they said I fit descriptions
Of a man that killed a witness
Ooo baby this aint fair
'Cause I was almost there
So just keep holdin' on
Sleet, hail or snow

Im comin' for you


Get that love ready
Hold steady

Speedin' high as a plane
On this rainy road
I know you need me so I gotta go
If your lovin' was smoke
Then my baby's dro
And I need a hit so yo I gotta roll
And it don't matter what I gotta do
Get out my way 'cause see im on the move
No need to wonder who I'm comin' to

Im comin' for you
Get that love ready
Hold steady

Staring at stars, getting high on her kissing

We're making plans for a family

Whispered in my ear but I'm telling you nothing
If I were you, you know what I'd do
Get one of your own so you can whisper too

It was all just a wonderful terrible wonderful...

I need you to lie to me

They drift farther
And farther and farther away
And the pieces of our 
Relationship become nothing more
Than curbside clutter
Than curbside clutter

So I'll kiss the morning air and fly away
Fly away from here today, today, today
And I'll kiss the morning air and fly away
Fly away from here today

You better take a seat, yeah, stay a while
I'm about to wear you out
And I'm not afraid to tell
You what this is all about
Now the world around me is slowly blending together
Like a wheel of colors
Are we so different you and I
Are we so different you and I
You loved me, and I loved you not
There's the door
Don't let it hit you on the way out

I got it all planned out,
I'll drive out to the edge of your yard
And we'll rip our tear drenched photographs apart
And watch them drift over the rooftops of this lonely southern town

Hey what's a difference?
It's a funny kind of love but I'll try it once

All that we need is to close to be seen.

A billion walls for me to climb,
You build your walls for me to climb.

Travels the very nature we live in,
Seasons to cycles children to men.

Mislead and misread,
Company or companion,
With all of or hearts,
We follow our dreams,
Slightly out of reach.

Just to keep alive the lies you told

And you forget the past days, when our sleep was kind
We lay away from nightmares
We lay away from you
And you forget the past days, when our sleep was kind

In dreams you ever leave undone your love
With blades not yet sank in your heart
But greased with tortured ego's blood
As a child you cry when shadows fall

And you're so cruel with us, killing yous sons and brothers

You're hiding your chest from the lance that you ground
-your heart a tourniquet for us-
And every face that you wore falls
Reduced to a scary ghost of you

What code should I have cracked
For you to ask me back

With you I understood
With you I'd live forever
With you I felt like someone good

I've walked a million miles
But I'm still around
Ain't nothing I can do
To shake the ghost of you

The cards that I've been dealt
The sting that I have felt
For all the games I've played
I guess it's time to pay

With you I could see clearly
With you I understood

promises all amount to lies
so where do I go from here?

It was a filthy pane of glass
I couldn't get a clear view

It wasn't the outside world I could see
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through

So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me

I was never focused on just one thing
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft
It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view

But I'm as good as asleep
I bet you didn't know
It takes a lot of it away if you do

It just had to be
Better that I break the window

So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window

Whatever's in front of me is covering my view
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
I only see what I'm looking through

I had to break the window
It just had to be it was in my way
Better that I break the window
Then forget what I had to say

So again I've done the right thing
I was never worried about that
The answer's always been in clear view
But even when the window's clean
I still can't see for the fact
That when it's clean it's so clear
I can't tell what I'm looking through

So I had to break the window

I had to break the window
It just had to be it was in my way
Better that I break the window
Then forget what I had to say

The ones who want to clock us,
The men who advertise it,
The customer who buys it,
And the hot black blood.

That brings me back to you,
Picks us apart.

An easy target when I miss the mark.

At the hands of the police.

So untouchable.

red, yellow and green

to win loneliness, she never touches his lips
but he'll touch her lower ones, you couldn't sew them shut
and if he doesn't have the funds, she'll make him sell his rings

not a man to speak of, regardless of they're age

like she was publishing books

I was galley, plus she was holdin her panties

there any much that a brother could do
we aptly made it to her apartment
for hardships, she marked in parts in were starving
a marksmen, had a target lined up
climbed up to mount 
but my mind said time to bounce.
but I didn't, she was propped up, WOW

Para que confusiones, decepciones y demas,

Now it's time for another mask,
A Face, my furrowed stare.

I'll try to see only the surface of the water but
The jokes continues and the purple hate gives a clear signal.

Vector rises,
And it brings lucid reasons to follow a balanced trail.
The return journey doesn't frighten me,
It doesn't frighten anymore.

The serpent will not eat it's tail again.

I'm pulling out a bottle of vodka
Replacing that with a pint of Jim Bean
I'm lying down on the floor until I feel better

It's morning and I pour myself coffee
I drink it til the kitchen stops shaking
I'm backing out of the driveway
And into creation

And the loving spirit that follows me
Watching helplessly, will always forgive me

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring down all those demons who drank with me
Feasting bleed through me
On my desperation

I hide all the bottles in places
They find and confront me with pain in their eyes
And I promise that I'll make some changes

But reaching back it occurs to me
There will always be some kind of crisis for me

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring back all those moments they stole from me
In my reverie
Darkening days end

Oh, I want to die alone
With my memories inside me
I want to live that life
When I could say people had faith in me
I still see that guy in my memory

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring down all those people who drank with me
Watching happily
My humiliation"

Straight out of Arizona, I told her that I'm a loner
I'm offering crystal, but she prefer lime and Corona
Super Saucy, Sergio ??? sandals
And when she in the Jacuzzi ooh, she lighting candles
Stuntin all the way across the floor for sure
Freshly molded by the hands of the lord and oh
Heavens angel, curves in every angle
Time play two to tango, bring the hook sang

I'm feeling like a drug I'm so high

Crunching on Greek salad under some conversation
Sipping on apple pucker twerping that mariuchi
I'm digging the purse, your matching, that's authentic guuchi
And you the chick that I been searching for across the globe
And I just wanted you to know…

Here he come with some for me
Freshly taken from banana tree

Banana man, me want a ton
Give me double and a bonus one
Give me more for all me friends
Dis banana flow will never end

Do you want a banana?
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mmm
Do you want a banana?
Dis banana for you

Tonight we dance around a flame
Then we get to play spirit game
Spirit names we shout out loud
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud
All the songbirds in the tree
Chant a tune to let the spirits free
Then we see them in the night
Spirits jumpin' by the fire light

Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana?)
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mmm
Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana?)
Dis banana for you
(oh ho ho) (ahhh)

Look you, you're too uptight you know
You can laugh and kick it back and go (weee)
But without a rhythm or a rhyme
You do not banana all the time
Fly away from city on the run
Try to make a little fun
(ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh ah huh)

Look you, come to the bungalow
African't you tell me don't you so
Don't you love the bumping of the drum
Make you shake until the bum go numb
Let the bongo play you till you drop
Dis banana never stop (never stop, never stop)

Forget all your troubles and go with the flow
Forget about whatever you may never know
Like whether whatever you are doing is whatever you should 
And whether anything you do is ever anything good
And then forget about banana when it stick in your throat
And when they make you wanna bellow but you're stuck in a choke 
And you forget about the yellow from the colorful man who make you take another one
And make a mock of your plan

Bungalay, Bungalow; make up your mind and tell me no
Hummmmm (shhh)

Well it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark
And the sun is falling from the sky
I've never left so early and you may wonder why
*whistle*

Tomorrow morning on the plane
No banana make you go insane
Floating back to busy town
No banana make you want to frown

Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana?)
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm
Do you want a banana?
Dis banana for you"

\""Are we on the air?  Yes, we are live at the scene
Of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building.
The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista.
Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_.  The big question is,
Will the rapper survive?\""

You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
(You're gonna make it)
Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine
It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_
Twista done blew up and tore the whole industry down

You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it

I can't control and shooting through my veins

When you wake up the world may have changed
But trust in me, I'll never falter or fail
Just the smile in your eyes, it can light up the night
And your laughter's like wind in my sails

'Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old

Lean on me, let our hearts beat in time
Feel strength from the hands that have held you so long
Who cares where we go on this rutted old road
In a world that may say that we're wrong

Zatvorite sve prolaze i uske a i široke

It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn
For like a thief in the night, He'll replace wrong with right
When He returns.

Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease
Until He returns?

Surrender your crown on this blood-stained ground, take off your mask,
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned,
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returns."

More than man or machine
More than luck, more than fiction
Higher than any religion

When life comes alive the past moves aside
No regrets and no remorse

We'll squeeze the blood out of life
And say goodnight to the silver of old
And even when wrong we're right
Far beyond the world of diamonds and gold
I've come to realize
Where happiness lies
I want you to know I know

131,Let Go,Somewhere,TRPFYPJ128F423EDF1,2005,"Always get in the way, never fall in line
Many have tried
Our lives they never felt right
We don't undersand

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Don't wait, the moment will fade
And you're on your own
Do you think so
All alone cause you never leave your home
You were never fine, so afraid of your life
Now she's into his thing cause he's gonna buy a ring
What a foolish bride
Open your eyes
Our lives thay never felt right, we don't understand

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
If we dare

I have hope, but mistakes i made hang on
Read my note, gonna cherish our photos
Going solo

Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
If we dare

Somewhere we can find it
If we dare"
132,Satanic Surfers,Restless Anger,TRPQQFX12903CBD5C7,2005,"The restless anger of youth still shakes this foundation now...
on which they've built up their empires of oppression
struggling for justice, the true people's court is in session out there on the streets

See it fall, come crumbling down
wow oh wow...watch it all come crumbling down

Wow oh wow...the times they are a changing
wow oh wow...there is no turning back

Let's go now...the time has come...
for the young...to assess the damage and reverse it!"

Forgive me friends,
For I am late again,
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try,
'Cause I'm still late again.

When they call my name outside those gates,
I'll be on my way,
Well that's all I can say,
'Cause I'm late again.

Late again,
Forgive me friends,
For I am late again,
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try,
'Cause I'm still late again.

With all the saints, that don't place blame
On sunshine, rain or snow,
Believe me 'cause I know.

That I'm Late again,
Forgive me friends,
For I am late again,
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try,
'Cause I'm still late again

I was late coming into this world,
I'll be late going out
I was late trying to put this record out

Go.

Late again,
Forgive me friends,
For I am late again,
Til' the day I die, Lord knows I'll try,
'Cause I'm still late again. [x2]

135,Ellie Lawson,Get What's Mine,TREOURB128F93087CB,2005,"Just you wait/it'll come around
It always does/don't you worry
Hold on tight/keep a calm
Don't be fooled/don't be alarmed

They say Good things come to those who wait
But I've been waiting
Oh such a long time

I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna get What's mine
You can't pull the wool over my eyes
I'm gonna get what's mine
No time to lose

Yes I've been hesitant/I've been/hesitant
But my history/It gives me strength
I'm better than before

The days Were passing by while I was with you
We were wrong together/Don't you see
Now I've got to think/about me

I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna get What's mine
You can't pull the wool over my eyes
I'm gonna get what's mine

It's too easy despising another for what you hate in your life
Fighting your people instead of using insight
Wise eyes identify why/wise eyes look away sometimes
Curbed from the day I was born/need to perform/torn
Raw energy like a storm/keeping on form
Worn down by the definite day to day pressure
Didn't you think I would try and get better

I'm gonna get what's mine
I'm gonna get
What's mine
You can't pull the wool over my eyes
I'm gonna get what's mine
No time to lose

My firm ambition is my ammunition
I'm dissin' on those time wasters that never listen
I'm on a mission/lyrics lick like kissing
So sly I'm hissing/frisky renditions issuing my skills
I'm flippin' sick of sitting still/Waiting for those fake money makers to get real/It'll build in steal/my will and way is my fortune
I'm dishing up my mind in mighty large portions
Call me the magical one/born Ellie Lawson
My form dawning on the scene so what with caution
Gonna break it down to ya just like this
Every time coming through to the brightness"

Mystery surrounds you, got to figure it out
Driving downtown to your house, your lights are never on
You got me hooked, I wanna drown
Without your hand I'm going down

And I can't stop, don't help me out, so lonely and I'm bleeding from the inside
Oh no no, no no
I need you, you need to remember, remember, remember who's your man

Met you on the corner not so long ago
You asked me where I was going, I said I don't know
Tell me how is it you came into my life so damn fast
You blew my mind, left me behind and now I'm living in your past

And I can't stop, blow me out, I'm so lonely, got me bleeding from the inside
I need you, and you need to remember, remember, can't you remember who's your man?

Who's your man?

You knocked me out, so lonely, got me bleeding from the inside
'Cause I need you, and you need to remember
I said, 'cause I need you, and you need to remember
Can you do that? 'Cause I'm so high
Remember, can't you remember, oh baby, remember who's your man

Who's your man? Who's your man? Who's your man?"

When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up: To more than I can be.

Foolish baby
Wipe your foolish blame
Crazy, crazy
Crazy, baby
Wipe your foolish blame

I've been thinking bout this all week
How were lost on a losing streak
Armed guards at the last mini-mart
Shootin' it wide of the mark
Roadblocks goin' up in the dark
Hi-rise towers take a tightrope walk

Truths a whisper
A shaky whisper
Chase it, then it's wrong
Time is panic
Hushed and rankled
You feel it, then it's gone

They take us in for identity checks
They've been roundin' up all their best bets
The refineries flare in the night
Roman candles from some other life
What's best, is somewhere in your hands
My best laid plans, your hands,
My best laid plans, your hands
Your hands, my best laid plans.
Shout! Got nothing to show for this
Shout! Where is the now?
Where are the next three minutes?
Shout! Got nothin' to show for this
Shout!"
140,DARKANE,Fading Dimensions,TRARUSX128F422F667,2005,"Captured in this domain of flesh and blood
An implant of illusions before closed eyes
Forced into the moving shadows
Reality challenges the most vivid imagination
The mind needs to discover for itself
Awake from this dream, living a nightmare

Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity

The face of reality is twisted without a form
Placed in this given, yet unwanted madness
Pushing all rational thoughts aside
Reopen the closed doors to infinity
Walking this delusive path
Fantasies more true than life itself

Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity
A growing equation of fading dimensions
Thirst exceeding the oceans

All access to devoted lust
Are only visions of passionate flesh
Forced into the moving shadows
Reality challenges the most vivid imagination
The mind needs to discover for itself
Awake from this dream, living a nightmare

Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity
A growing equation of fading dimensions
Thirst exceeding the oceans"

See what you can see
Another land, another people
Essentially like you and me

Been the buildings blocks of change
Recognise each circumstance
We're family not a bloody race

Here come the time
Here come the place
Here come the moment
Here come the perfect days

Each and every creature
Has it's true and rightful place
We are not the overlords
We are links upon the chain
And each and every creature
Treasures in their heyday
Nobody can overlord
We're sharing, there's a world
And there's the space

And if you've travelled worldwide
And you get to speak another lingo
Then you online, your online oh yeah
They say knowledge
It is power
Not to be abused
Use it for a little understanding
Gotta use that God given tool
