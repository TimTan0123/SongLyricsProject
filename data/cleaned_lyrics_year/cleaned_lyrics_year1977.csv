0,Dalida,J'Attendrai,TRVKQEC128F9302DFB,1977,"J'attendrai, le jour et la nuit, 
J'attendrai toujours, 
Ton retour, j'attendrai, 
Car l'oiseau qui s'enfuit 
Vient chercher l'oubli dans son nid.
Le temps passe et court, 
En battant tristement dans mon coeur si lourd
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour

Le vent m'apporte des bruits lointains,
Guétant ma porte, j'écoute en vain
Hélas plus rien, plus rien me vient.

J'attendrai, le jour et la nuit,  
J'attendrai toujours,
Ton retour, j'attendrai, 
Car l'oiseau qui s'enfuit 
Vient chercher l'oubli dans son nid.
Le temps passe et court, 
En battant tristement dans mon coeur si lourd
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour

Le temps passe et court, 
En battant tristement dans mon coeur si lourd
Et pourtant j'attendrai ton retour"
1,Black Uhuru,I Love King Selassie,TRBCRBC128C7196576,1977,"I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

I love King Selassie red
I love King Selassie I gold
I love King Selassie green
Oh, I love everything that is clean

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

He's the only man in flesh
Whom you can't look in the eyes
From the first time I know JAH JAH
He is so divine   
He is called as a Lamb 
The only man that's on this land 
Some people feel that they can work Jah to the bone

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I

So they can rule the trone

Useless praying to the spirit
'Cause the spirit is within the flesh of I and I
So there goes an illusion
The spirit is an illusion

I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I
I love King Selassie
I love King Selassie I"
2,Cartola,Fita Meus Olhos,TRQGRNX128F9338694,1977,"Fita os meus olhos
Vê como eles falam
Vê como reparam o seu proceder
Não é preciso dizer deve compreender
Até mesmo notar só no meu olhar
Não abuses por eu te convessar
Que nascestes só para eu te amar
Gosto tanto tanto de você
Que os meus olhos falam o que não vê
Ainda há de chegar o dia
Que eu hei de ter tanta alegria
Quando você souber compreender
Num olhar o que eu quero dizer"
3,The Isley Brothers,LIVIN' IN THE LIFE,TRDMOWW128F4261AAA,1977,"Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Think that you might know, you find that you're really wrong
My pictures come and go but my living has got to go on

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

You ain't me and I ain't you
That's the horrible difference between the two"
4,The Dils,Mr. Big,TRBULSZ128F932C031,1977,"Hey, Mr. Big, you look so big to others
Hey, Mr. Big, well I can see you're nothing
You watch TV to learn the news
Don't switch the station, you'll get confused

When you go downtown, you're driven in your car
While I take the bus--twice as long to get half as far

Sneaking in at 2 AM--walking on your toes
So over confident, you think that no one knows

And you hate me
And I hate you

Hey, Mr. Big, well now I know the truth
When the walls come down, I'll be there to see
The look on your face when you see me"
5,Richard Hell & The Voidoids,New Pleasure (Album Version),TRRDXGU128F9341B55,1977,"Your mind's a wreck but that's fine
It corresponds to mine
We're in a room the door closes
Automatic aut- (hypnosis) -matic automatic auto-

New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure

Too weak for life you have become
You can't get dressed you're too numb
But we assume sublime poses
Deep in true to life (hypnosis) true to life in true to life in

New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure

You're in too deep you can't survive
Or can't be you past twenty-five
A day's a week the monster dozes
Deep in passionate (hypnosis) passionate in passionate in

New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure"
6,Johnny Winter,It Was Rainin',TRDJCWM128F42676BA,1977,"Well I know the sun ain't shinin', it looks like the rain about to fall
Well you know I believe the sun ain't shinin', looks like the rain about to fall (comin' down)
Well you know when I'm home with my woman,
I don't need no sun at all (not all all, man I don't mind)

Well you know, I feel so good that when I hear, when I hear that lonesome sound

Well last time it was stormy, you know I was down in New Orleans (yes it's a nice place to be you know)
You know last time it was stormy (it was stormin' bad) you know I was livin' down in New Orleans
You know it'd take a whole lot more than blood and water For me to keep my business clean

Oh yeah, I'm clean...

Oh!
Rain on, rain on..."
7,Journey,People,TRKNLKH128F427BDEA,1977,"Who are the ones that slip and slide through life,
Moving like the waves in a sink,
People, always need a minute or two to think.

Who says they're not going to Hell,
Climbing the stairway to you know where,
People, Oh! so happy until they scare.

Who always has got to talk about somebody else,
Born as a God, they think that's got to be
People, simply just another you and me."
8,Abba,Happy Hawaii,TRLSMDV128E078F294,1977,"Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey honololu, we're going to happy hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey honololu, we're going to happy hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But i, but I believe love gives me a second chance

Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From honololu, a greeting from happy hawaii

It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey honololu, we're going to happy hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey honololu, we're going to happy hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But i, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm

I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
Hey honololu, we're going to happy hawaii"
9,Donatella Rettore,Carmela,TRHOCTO128F42A534F,1977,"Carmela regalava caramelle colorate
Ma erano caramelle avvelenate
Di giorno piangeva sulle tombe dei vivi
Di notte cercava pace tra gli ulivi
Hanno sparato a salve dicono
Solo per farli sloggiare
E invece gli hanno fatti cadere
I cani se hanno paura
Vanno tenuti alla catena..
Carmela viveva sulle bocche dei ragazzi
Che volevano solo un po' di pace per i loro vecchi

Barcellona sembrava un prato
Ma era un campo di sterminio
E i soldati con i fucili in mano
Tutelavo col sangue la pace dei civili
E loro si incontravano di notte
Per non farsi vedere
Cantavano e facevano l'amore
E Carmela gli chiudeva gli occhi
E Carmela era una stella,
Una perla nera
Carmela era la loro bandiera.

A quarant'anni o si è furbi o si è eroi
A quarant'anni lui amava solo lei
Gli occhiali gli cadevano sul naso
Ma mentre attentava l'ultima vela
Nel suo letto in paradiso cantava
Oh, oh, oh, Carmela

Carmela regalava caramelle avvelenate
Ma si dice che qualcuno sia risorto dopo averle assaggiate

Barcellona sembrava un prato
Ma era un campo di sterminio
E i soldati con i fucili in mano
Tutelavo col sangue la pace dei civili
E loro si incontravano di notte
Per non farsi vedere
Cantavano e facevano l'amore
E Carmela gli chiudeva gli occhi
E Carmela era una stella
Una perla nera
Carmela era la loro bandiera

Oh, oh, oh, Carmela"

Mary of the fourth form

Stretchin' out her long legs
Pullin' up her stockings
She's combing out her black hair
Starin' at the teacher
Openin' her lips wide
Shiftin' in her seat, yeah
She slowly moves her hips aside

But in the middle of the night
She wakes her mom to put out the light
Her makeup's on and her jeans are skintight
And she's heading to the Pillar Bar

She walks into the pool hall room

His hand moves out to touch her
She straightens and looks around, now
She laughs and leaves the room, yeah
Heartbreak for the teacher
And sweet dreams for young Mary

But in the middle of the night
She wakes her dad to put out the light
Her makeup's on and her jeans are skintight
And she's headed to the Pillar Bar

She walks into the pool hall room

But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone

Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway

With a smile upon his face
He fired his starting pistol
And began the human race
There were faces all around me
They were running everywhere
But everywhere is nowhere
And nowhere isn't there

It's a game
A game
a game that we're playing
Well
I don't mind but I don't make the rules
It's a game
A game
A game that we're playing
Just a game for lovers and fools

There's snakes upon your ladder
And there's dice upon your skirt
There's lipstick on my collar
And there's sweat upon my shirt
The neighbours will start talking
But you know that I don't care
For the neighbours they are nowhere
And nowhere isn't there

It's a game

18,Gasolin',Strengelegen,TRZODJE128F92F37CF,1977,"Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Når du først får begyndt så kan du ikke holde op

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Når du først får begyndt så kan du ikke holde op

Der var engang en spillemand der spillede til bal
Han spilled fire dage til et vikingeknald
Af sprut var der meget og af flasker var der fler'
Af kvinder var der mange som ville mer' og mer'

De andre spillemænd de måtte gå deres vej
For denne spillemand han kunne spille strengeleg
Han spilled fire døgn helt uden stop
For da først han var begyndt der ku' han ikke holde op
Hør bare

Da ballet var forbi gik spillemanden hjem
Igennem skoven mørk han famlede sig frem
Pludselig han gled i en bjørnefælde ned
Der stod en kæmpebjørn med kæberne på gled

Den kiggede på ham og han gloede på den
Så brummede den truende og tog et skridt frem
Han havde ingen våben kun en strengeleg
Åh søde lille bjørn, hva' kan jeg gøre for dig
Den brummed

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Og når du først er begyndt så skal du ikke holde op

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Og når du først er begyndt så skal du ikke holde op

Og spillemanden spillede han spilled som besat
Og bamsedyret dansede den hele lange nat
Han kunne ikke stoppe nej han måtte køre på
Han vidste han var død hvis først han gik i stå

Da røg der en streng på den sprøde strengeleg
Men bjørnen sagde spil eller jeg æder dig
Til sidst var der kun en sølle streng igen
Og spillemanden tænkte, så det sket gamle dreng

Men i daggryet kom der fire jægersmænd
De listede på tå til bjørnegraven hen
De hørte jo musik dybt dernedefra
Og studsede en kende da de så hvad det var

Der dansede en bjørn med en mand i sin favn
Han råbte frels mig for satan i gudernes navn

De skød det store dyr og fik spillemanden op
Nu stod han der med strengeleg og sønderrevet krop
Jeg troede jeg sku' dø og nu ligger dyret der
I frelste mit liv, hvordan kan jeg takke jer
De sagde

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for oss
Spil en boogie-voogie på din spilleklods
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Når du først får begyndt så kan du ikke holde op

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg
Spille spille spille som en spindetop
Når du først får begyndt så kan du ikke holde op

Spillemand åh spillemand åh spil for mig
Spil en boogie-voogie på din strengeleg

I'm gonna live on a mountain
Way down under in Australia
It's either that or suicide
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I got a mind
Over you it's not the first time
Ooh, I got a mind

Rainbow's crawling on a midday sun
But I've been lucky you're the only one
Sunday's calling, you'll be number one
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, you think of Jesus Christ
You walk on water but don't bet your life, oh no
All you walk is a fine line
It's such a strange strain on you

Downed, downed out of my head

Too many people want to save the world
Another problem is it a boy or girl
Some say the weekend is the only world
It's such a strange strain on you
Ooh, I've got a mind
Over you it's not the first time

I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right.

What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Back at the hotel, lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar, What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne

Recuerdas algo de lo que te
Ocurrió ayer
Ya se que no te importa
Te llueve por la noche
Y caminas todo el día
Vas en busca de tu ser
En tus labios brilla una sonrisa
Que penetra en lo más hondo
De mi ser
Ya sé que no te importa
Tú tienes que seguir
Tú debes conseguir
Que nada te ate aquí
En tu mente ya lo pones
Todo tal como ha de ser
Sigue luchando y podrás lograr
Al fin tu ser"
23,Kenny Loggins,If You Be Wise,TRFTFSZ128F42676F5,1977,"See her candle,
Waver in the window of her summer night.
Lying on the breeze,
She tries to fall asleep.
Flights of fancy,
Dancing through her memories like Arabian Nights.
He is riding on his wings of fire,
And flies away.
She can still hear him say.

If you'll be wise,
If you'll be smart,
Don't let a travelin' man take your heart.
Take my advice,
Don't let it start,
You'll think you're different from the rest.
You'll try to do your part,
Until he breaks your heart.

Lunch for the lonely,
Looking at picture postcards of someone else's scene.
Somehow they don't seem real,
The sea's too green.
Somebody calls her,
Giving out information,
About the boy on the moon.
Suddenly it's all too much,
To be told,
What she already knows.

If you'll be wise,
If you'll be smart,
Don't let a travelin' man take your heart.
Take my advice,
Don't let it start,
'Cause you've been told too many times.

If you'll be wise,
If you'll be smart,
Don't let a travelin' man take your heart.
Take my advice,
Don't let it start,
'Cause you've been told too many times.

If you'll be wise,
If you'll be smart,
Don't let a travelin' man take your heart.
Take my advice,
Don't let it start,
'Cause when he comes and needs a friend,
He'll do it all again.

Better be smart,
He's breakin' your heart,
Find you another lover.
Better be wise,
And open your eyes,
This time."

Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure,
You let me love you till I was a failure --
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine

I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, O sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

Your sister fingers burned like iodine
And all my wanton lust was iodine
My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine"
25,Ola Magnell,Pappa,TRKCIDW128E078B1BB,1977,"Pappa, där du vilar i din himmel eller grav
Må ingen störa friden eller ställa flera krav
Du brukade vår jord och gav oss livets bästa bröd
Du gnodde för oss andra
Som irrande får vandra
Som trampar på varandra – jorden där vi gick är död

Pappa, du som visste allt om tunnland och hektar
Jag kunde offra konsten för bilden jag har kvar
Av dej bland folk och fä och nån gång med din fiol
Som fick din blick att glimma
Fast inga barn fick stimma
Fast du var trygg som urberg var du fjärran som en sol

Pappa, ändå levande som ryps och raps och råg
Din blick var blå och fylld av havre mest varthelst du såg
När skoporna tog sådden, såg du snett på ditt gevär
Och svor åt dessa jävlar
Som skövlar och som skrävlar
Du stäcktes innan tjälen gick ur jorden du höll kär

Pappa, du kunde aldrig rasta längs den väg du gått
Eller unna dej att njuta av vad du och andra sått
Du lever i mitt hjärta och strax intill den gård
Där du fick sno och ila
Har du fått ro och vila
Och vinden smeker gräset runt graniten på din vård

Pappa, varför gråter jag och varför är det så
Att dagarna känns tomma och att nätterna känns grå
Jag vet att ingenting är lätt men är det mödan värt
Att leva snett och såra
Och göra svaren svåra
Och sträva fast man innerst inne ingenting har lärt

Pappa, när det kryper under skinnet och blir kaos
Och när jag skenar fastän jag behöver ta en paus
Då tänker jag på dej och det liv du levt och sett
Bland smedjor, skjul och stallar
Bland trädor, stubb och vallar
Och undrar hur det nu har kunnat bli så skevt och snett

Pappa, varför drunknar all min visshet i en flod
Av missmod, hat och alkohol som flyter i mitt blod
Och varför gör jag det jag vet att ingen mänska bör
Jag ber dej inte svara
Jag ber dej bara vara
Hos mej en liten stund innan också natten dör

Pappa, där du vilar i din himmel eller grav
Må du sova sött och må du nu få koppla av
Den kamp du måste föra och det slit som gav oss bröd
Den väg vi måste vandra
Hur ska jag kunna klandra
Dina fel när också jorden där du sått är död"
26,Juice Leskinen,Tarzanin kalsarit,TRVAKJD128F9344332,1977,"Jane kävi Nairobissa joskus kesäkuussa.
Kotiin viidakkoon hän saapui aivan illan suussa.
Tarzan huutojansa kajautteli leipäpuussa,
Reumatismi ankara kun kouri lonkkaluussa.
Tarzan huomas Janen, kysyi: ""Mitäs toit""
Jane sanoi: ""Arvata sen tuskin voit..""

Toinpa sulle kalsarit, on niissä kuminauhaa!
Ihme on jos reumatismiltasi saa et rauhaa.
Ja tiukaksi on koitettu ne kutoa-
Ne uidessakaan kintuista ei putoa.
Tarzan katsoi epäillen ja sanoi: ""Kuule, Jane,
Enpä noita kalsareita jalkoihini pane""

Eihän ne nyt sovi apinoiden kuninkaalle.
Paras, että muutat äitis luokse Ghanaan, maalle.
Mikä kumma järjen sulta Nairobissa otti?
Eihän noita pidä edes hullu hottentotti.
Nehän pirut, haiseekin kuin kuollut napakettu
Jane sanoi: ""Ne on antibaktiraikastettu""

Tarzan huusi: ""Johan noita apinatkin kaihtaa""
Nytpä mennään Nairobiin, ne täytyy heti vaihtaa""
Jane itkuun pillahti, ja Tarzan murahteli-
Oli näätkös, monsuuni ja hiton huono keli.
Jane kysyi: ""Eikö mentäis vasta maanantaina""
Tarzan huusi: ""Täällä eivät naisen puheet paina""

Tarzan pakkas jenkkikassin, tappoi parit luteet.
Kysyi sitten: ""Jane-kulta, missä on mun kuteet""
Jane maalas huulia ja veti luomeen lilaa,
Sanoi sitten: ""Toivon etten fiilinkiäs pilaa,
Mut Nairobiin saat tulla tuossa tyykissä.
Kaikki lannevaatteet ovat pyykissä"".

Tarzan kiros afrikaksi, sitten sonnustautui:
Veti jalkaan kalsarit, ja niissä munat hautui. 
Kohta lähti matkaan tämä metsän pariskunta.
Kilimandzarolla oli melkein metri lunta.
Loppumatkan liftasivat pitkin autostradaa,
Valikoivat Mersua, ei Miniä, ei Ladaa.

Kello puoli kuusi löytyi Nairobista puoti,
Jonka kalsareissa oli tulipalomuoti.
Tarzan sanoi: ""Noita ei voi käyttää kundi raavas""
Myyjä moitti: ""Heittäisit jo traditiokaavas""
Jane tuumi: ""Se on nykyaikasta
Ja ne on seksikkäätkin tuosta paikasta""

Tarzan antoi periksi ja nieli omat aatteet,
Ajatteli: ""Antaa olla, vaatteet mitkä vaatteet""
Sanoi: ""Mennään juomaan jotain, minulla on jano""
Kapakista löytyi Martini ja Red Cinzano.
Sitten kun he kävelivät torilla,
Tarzaniimme viehtyi naarasgorilla.

Tarzan oli myyty mies, jäi Jane siihen paikkaan.
Tarzan väitti tuntevansa lemmenkutsun raikkaan.
Lähti gorilloineen ravintolaan Algerian.
Jane pyysi: ""Tarzan-kulta, palannethan pian""
Tarzan nauraa röhötti, ja Jane meni himaan,
Sanoi: ""Tule edes viidakkoomme talvehtimaan""

Taas he viidakossa on, on tullut tupenrapina.
Tarzan siirtyi nykyaikaan: vaimonaan on apina
Jane on vain orjatar ja kotiapulainen.
Tarzan viinaa juo- on kroonisesti krapulainen.
Jane sanoo: ""Väliäkös hälläkään,
Kun ei väri lähde itkemälläkään."

My woman is black, but now she's blue

A motor-city love affair
In the heat of the night
A woman dark and debonair
Too hard to resist
The moment you've kissed

Feelin' good, feelin' down
Repercussions of a heavy heart

You go te the airport
And see a plane take off,
Go to England
Or take a trip by sea
And get off, where you want to get off,
Write to the boy
Next door, who always wants
To do, what you're just about to do
Tell him that
You like New York city
I'm sure he'll like it too
- you say you like your nation
- so let's take a long vacation

Tell your navigator
To wait downstairs
With his white gloves on,
Tell him to
Zip up your bag
With his white gloves on
Take your diamond,
So if you've got the money left,
You can always sell it
Here I come,
Get ready
Get set fire go, go, go, go, go

Sens me where I
Where I want to go
That's a fact
He thinks I'm great
'cos I treat him like dirt, like durt,
He does me favours
But I could do with
Even better ones,
They call him sticky
'cos I treat him like dirt,
Like dirt, like dirt

- so let's take a long vacation 	

Your transit airman
Is heating up the engine
Clear your head,
Go out and get it
Instead of watching T.V.,
And stagnating in your bed,
By the window
Thinking of the next record
That you're going to buy,
You like Maurice
With his safety pin
So it's gonna be a Punk one
- you say you like your nation
- so let's take a long vacation

Got the wanderlust
It's time to go
And do, what you've decided to do
Go to Milan
Or if not just you take a bike
To see a sight
I feel free
You feel free
And how about the boy next door,
Tell him that
You like New York
I'm sure he'll like it too
- you say you like your nation
- so let's take a long vacation"

Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

Lay down beside me and love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurting of this world away
Hold me so close that I'll feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for a while"

Science opened up the door 
We would feed the hungriy fields 
Tilll they could'nt eat no more 

But the potion that we made 
Touched the creatures down below 
And they grow up in a way 
That we'd never seen before 
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

They were angry with the man 
Cause changed their way of life 
And they take their sweet revenge 
As they trample throught the night 

For hundred miles or more 
You could hear the people cry 
But there is nothing you can do 
Even god is on their side 
God is on, god is on, god is on their side 
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

Cars will break the light 
Come flowing in the air 
The creature will decide 
Who goes where 
How can I explain 
Things are different today 
Darkness all around 
No one makes a sound 
Such a sad affaire 
No one seems to care 
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature 

Better watch out 
There's no way to stop it now 
You can't escape it's too late 
Look what you've done 
There's no place that you can run 
The monsters made, we must pray 

Maybe nature has a plan 
To control the way of man 
He must start from scratch again 
Many battles must he win 
Till he earns his place on earth 
Like the other creatures do 
Will there be a happy end 
Now that all depends on you

32,Arlo Guthrie,City of New Orleans,TRBVCYN128F92F3487,1977,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
3 conductors, 25 sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, and freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Dealing card games, with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels, rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets, made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep, are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem, to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night America, how are you
Said don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done"

Because if only, reach out for me

You'll reach out for me, baby
I'm as close as your phone
Ever since you've been gone
I've been home
And home ain't home

Without that feelin' without that smile
Without your love baby it's all not worthwhile
And I need that feelin' I need that smile
To make my life worth livin

And being swept away
The king is in the closet
He's hiding from today
And though he owns all fortunes
This room is where he'll stay
And his world is filled with darkness, turning grey

Gazing out the window
Of the 42nd second floor
He is separate from all others
No one knocks upon his door
And it might as well be raining 'cause the sunlight hurts his eyes
And his ears will never hear the children's cries

Once proud and full of passion
He fought the cause of man
Many people loved his courage
Many followed his command
He changed the old into the new
And the course of things to come
And then one day they noticed he was gone

At first it didn't matter
Nobody seemed to care
They all became too busy
To find him anywhere
So no one knew not even him
The problems he would find
On the day he journeyed deep into his mind

I close my eyes I go far away
Away from this battlefield
In my dreams well here I will enjoy it
Where innocence plays with all the laughing children
The kind who are crying right now
A taste of freedom from the pain
Of everything here I see
Life is sweet but I took it all for granted
And now I don't know if I could even tell you
Just what we permit, we allow

Allow me to forget the life I've made my own
I've held this nation in my hand
And yet it's not my home
Oh, Allow me just one answer and one reason why
Why this refugee of the family of man must die
Tell me why

Daydreams filled his nighttimes
And night dreams filled his days
Confusion and uncertainty
A puzzled mind of haze
You thought he was so powerful
And set upon his ways
Well he left us all to follow through this maze

I heard the king was dying
I heard the king was dead
And with him died the chronicles
That no one ever read
The closet's fully empty now
It's occupied by none
I'll draw the drapes now destiny is done"

There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry

Oh, I am a flame; feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can run without fear

If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me; I keep myself so close to my sight
No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea
'Cause every day, a fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me

I will give you secrets too, an attitude that you may borrow

Bilarna bullrar
Genom tunnelbaneträngsel
Går jag in i fel affär i fel kö och försöker va kooool
Jag stångar mej loss och fångas upp i deras dolda stängsel
– detta krämarfängsel
Där hjärnan går i bitar medan läpparna ler som en sol

Fort in i dimman,
Min gamle lömske psykiater
Där, bland fjolliga frillor och aphanetjatter och spleen
Blir du en främling för dej själv och fjantar med i en förryckt teater

Då är det dags att dra benet, loser, och lämna ditt vin

Och Mammon tvår sina händer

Dom suger dej tom, lille vän, innan vinden vänder

Och så den där gamla känslan av att inte duga någonting till

Och för dom som babblar och för dom som inte är vad dom verkar va

Men jag skiter i mallar
Jag skiter i konstnärsidealen
Det behövs säkert både poesi och propagandamusik
Men dom får mej att känna skuld enligt den puritanska moralen
Världen är galen
Om allting bara blir en förevändning för att älta politik

Men rulltrappan rullar
Och jag plågas av musik som inte märks men söver
Varenda liv, varenda känsla så länge ruljangsen  går bra

Men vad du behöver
Är en boning i dej själv – det måste man ha

Jason B. Sad was a lonely lad 
His head was a bed for everyone 
His clothes was his life 
but his heart was a knife 
Inscribed on it was ""rock 'n' roll is cruel"" 

Take me to school, boy 
Leave me alone, boy 
Slice me a bone of the Universe 
Take me to school, boy 
Leave me alone, boy 
Slice me a bone of the Universe 

Jason got weird and he pierced his ears 
A gypsy alone in his gallantry 
He met Shaky Sue, who wore only blue 
And they shared in their teenage misery 

Then Jason read books and wore hard looks 
He swapped Sue for an artisan 
His winters were long and a fantastic song 
Grew from his head like a marigold"

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before

'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mmm-mmm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk

And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

Won the ribbons at the Rodeo

Thought I saw your face
Tired and worn

Tried to find a place

Is promised for his seeing

Driven far from the path
Rereleased in inhibitions

Hark thru dark ties

In challenge as direct
As eyes see young stars assemble

As exists cross divided
In all encircling mode
Oh closely guided plan
Awaken in our heart

Master of soul
Set to touch
All impenetrable youth
Ask away

With all that's clear
Be honest with yourself
There's no doubt
No doubt

Over all our lands
And as we look
Forever closer
Shall we now bid
Farewell farewell...

Somewhere in space
The twilight has come and there is no tomorrow
And night after day
She's driftin' away
And time is run out for our lady of sorrow

Lady don't you cry
This time you'll stay high

Lately when I've seen her
She would smile as if to say
That the worst was over
And there'd soon be brighter days
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'


She goes to the door
And ask just once more
She gives everything she could beg, steal or borrow
And each time is her last
But time moves too fast
And time has run out for our lady of sorrow

Lady don't you frown
This time you won't come down

Just today I watched them as
They carried her away
And I can only hope that she
Has found a brighter day
But I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'
Had there been someone near to care what then?"
49,Eugenio Finardi,Scuola,TRFAFGV128F930258C,1977,"(Eugenio Finardi) 

Ci dicevano, insistevano, di studiare 
Che da grandi ci sarebbe stato utile sapere 
Le cose che a scuola andavamo a imparare 
Che un giorno avremmo dovuto anche lavorare. 

E c'è chi è stato promosso, c'è chi è stato bocciato, 
Chi non ha retto la commedia ed è uscito dal gioco 
Ma quelli che han studiato e si son laureati 
Dopo tanti anni adesso sono disoccupati. 

Infatti mi ricordo mi sembrava un po' strano 
Passare quelle ore a studiare latino 
Perché allena la mente a metter tutto in prospettiva 
Ma io adesso non so calcolare l'iva. 

Io volevo sapere la vera storia della gente 
Come si fa a vivere e cosa serve veramente 
Perchè l'unica cosa che la scuola dovrebbe fare: 
È insegnare a imparare 

Io per mia fortuna me ne son sempre fregato 
Non facevo i compiti, non ho quasi mai studiato. 
Ascoltavo dischi, mi tenevo informato. 
Cercavo di capire ed adesso me la so cavare. 

Perciò va pure a scuola per non far scoppiar casino, 
Studia matematica ma comprati un violino, impara a lavorare il legno, 
Ad aggiustar ciò che si rompe, che non si sa mai nella vita 
Un talento serve sempre."

Dreaming of the day
The boat along the side
Sails to carry us away
Islands on the river

It could happen soon
But just like yesterday
The ships have come and gone
And we were not along
 
Oh
Tomorrow never came
I've been here dark till dawn
And still end up the same
I've seen them all
Seen them through
Can I ever see the end of you
 
Anyway
Darling what's the use
Oh some things never change
The perfume and the promise
Merely rearranged
To look like new
The clock upon the tower
Still chiming like the fool

Oh, we were lying together in a silver lining

Not another moment
Not another moment to waste

Oh well, you hold me so close that my knees grow weak
But my soul is flying high above the ground
I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do
I just can't seem to make any sound

I keep holding on
To the happy times

Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain

That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

There ain't much a broken heart can see
When tomorrow hides
The dream beyond this dream 

Oh, there's a light that shines on all people
Sees them through
It waits and watches them move
Through their lives like people do"

She walks through the stars
Past Saturn and Mars
Who knows how she feels
With the moon on her heel

In Swirling soft flight
Owls hoot and stare
As the wind lifts her hair

se vinco mi danno un litro di benzina

sdraiata sul cofano all'autosalone

Come into my room again.
Broken window pane,
Now reminds me I'm alive.

Could it be right,
Givin' up, my darlin'?
I'll wait for you now,
To remind me why I've gone.

How I love to write,
Songs that have no answers.
Oh, there's nothin' on my mind,
That I want to let go of.

Letting it go on pretendin',
Everything has its way of endin'.
And I'm a loner,
The way I should be.

Set it free,
Let it free my love to fly,
Set it free.
Set it free,
Let it free my love to be,
Can I be free?

Still it's gotta rain,
Wonder when I'll see a change in weather.
Somethin's gettin' tangled up again,
And I can't find an end.

Can't let it go on returnin',
I've given everything that the harlequin boy can find.
And I'm tired of trying,
I'd rather leave than tell lies.

Set it free,
Let it free my love to fly,
Set it free.
Set it free,
Let it free my love to be,
You'll be free.

You'll be free my love to fly,
Free to be what I can't face.
In love again,
Set it free.

Free,
Set it free,
Set it free my love.

Free,
Set it free,
Set it free my love."

Before he speaks the world around us quiets.

With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather.

Many in a circle slowly 'round the fire
When he is gone I want to know him better.

No one is forsaken, no one is a liar,
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water.

He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns,
We are singing and playing, I hear what he's saying.

I remember breezes from winds inside your body
keep me high, like I told you, I'll sing to them this story and know why."

Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pines
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's so hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face
Yes, I did, and I -- I tripped and I missed my star
God, I fell and I fell alone, I fell alone
And the moon's a harsh mistress
And the sky is made of stone

The moon's a harsh mistress
She's hard to call your own."

Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when you close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies?
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

Mysteries like this and
Many others in the trees
Blow in the night in the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........"

Oriental eyes reveal the lies, deceit, betrayal
On this journey behold one who travels far
You called him fool but now you are

The wizard wanders through the world he made from dreams
The splashing whirlpool drowns the frightened screams
Exotic dancers, flashing lancers, this mysterious space
The fanfare advances, the warlord falls from grace

It clears your pain, but it's got you claimed again, my love
You feel the need, but it lets you bleed, you must concede, my love
No one to blame, no shame, you crave again and again, my love
No use to plead, from you it feeds, on your greed, my love
It's got you, my love

I took a line that comes from the golden states of Shan
The smugglers trail that leads to the opium den
The Chinese connection refines to heroin
Depart the heart you crave again

It clears your pain, but you soul is claimed again, my love
You feel the need, but it lets you bleed, you must concede, my love
No one to blame, no shame, you crave again and again, my love
No use to plead, from you it feeds, on your greed, my love"

75,The Charlie Daniels Band,Billy The Kid,TRVIHBR128F4264145,1977,"In the southern part of Texas, east and west of El Paso
Where the mighty Franklin Mountains guard the trail to Mexico
There's a new-made widow crying and a hearse a-rollin' slow
I guess the devil's passed this way again.

There's a lathered sorrel stallion running through the Joshua trees
And a young man in the saddle with his coat tails in the breeze.
He's got a six gun on his right hip and a rifle at his knees
And he's dealing in a game that he can't win.

Poor Billy Bonney, you're only 21,
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun.
Every notch you carve on your six gun
Has a bloody tale to tell.
You're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of Hell.

Those fancy clothes you're wearin' and the women in your bed
Can't take away the traces of the men that you've left dead
As you ride across the badlands with a price upon your head
And now the Wheel of Fortune starts to turn.

Your reputation's grown 'til it's the biggest in the land
And there ain't a lot of people left who want to call your hand
And I guess you'll go down shootin' and like all branded men
When you shake hands with the devil you get burned.

Poor Billy Bonney, you're only 21,
Pat Garrett's got your name on every bullet in his gun.
Every notch you carve on your six gun
Has a bloody tale to tell.
You're a mile ahead of Garrett and a step outside of Hell."

Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye
And a blade shining oh so bright

There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh baby, you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light

But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over, you know
We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes

But when the day is done and the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black Phantom bike
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light

Nothing ever grows in this rotten old hole
Everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you

Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you
Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned

I'll come crawling on back to you
And like a sinner before the gates of heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

Oh, I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell
And the last thing I see is my heart
Still beating
Breaking out of my body and flying away

Well are you really who we think you are
Or does your smile seem to wear you down

And the dream that you must live - a disease for which there is no cure
This roller coaster ride you're on won't stop to let you off

And the judges, do they ever ask to read between your lines

Next year, what will you do when you have been forgotten

A lifetime since I looked into your eye-eyes
You held me like one holds onto a dream that has gone bad
Ain't it scary how so many dreams run dry

You've traveled round the world two times since you've left me
Fell in love three times, grown restless another four
But through the haze of love and pain
You say you wanna feel young again
Ain't it funny how that happens when you get older
Whoa when you get o-older

And you don't know-ow me anymore, I've changed
The innocence you found disappeared when you went away
And I don't fall in love that quickly like I used to do
The passion still explodes, bound by a longer fuse

You're livin' with a rock 'n' roll musician off the coast
I hope he makes it, walk alone at night just to get away
He waits for you in bed and when it don't feel good you learn to fake it
I can see you lyin' silent in your rage, woh-oh in silent rage

And you don't know-ow me anymore, I've changed
The innocence you found disappeared when you went away
And I don't fall in love that quickly like I used to do
The passion still explodes, bound by a longer fuse
Bound by a longer fuse (I don't fall in love)
Bound by a longer fuse (I don't fall in love)

81,Don Williams,Time On My Hands,TRMCRDD128F429F771,1977,"Everyday of my life until forever 
Is spoken for when you looked at me. 
Now that you're gone my life goes on
But all of the heart is out of me. 

Chorus:
And I've got time on my hands, you on my mind. 
No where to send all my love
And I'll be here waiting if you ever change your plans
'Cause you own this time on my hand.

Each mornin' I see the future before me
Empty and as endless as the sky 
I should be here to build life again
But I just can't find the reason why.

Chorus:
While, I've got time on my hands, you on my mind. 
No where to send all my love,
I'll be here waiting if you ever change your plans. 
'Cause you own the time on my hand..."
82,The Adverts,Gary Gilmore's Eyes,TRDXPJW128F9308FBD,1977,"I'm lying in a hospital,
I'm pinned against the bed.
A stethoscope upon my heart,
A hand against my head.
They're peeling off the bandages.
I'm wincing in the light.
The nurse is looking anxious,
And she's quivering in fright...

I'm looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes.

The doctors are avoiding me.
My vision is confused.
I listen to my earphones,
And I catch the evening news.
A murderer's been killed,
And he donates his sight to science.
I'm locked into a private ward.
I realise that I must be...

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes.

Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes.

I smash the light in anger.
Push my bed against the door.
I close my lids across my eyes,
And wish to see no more.
The eye receives the messages,
And sends them to the brain.
No guarantee the stimuli must be perceived the same...

When looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes.

Gary don't need his eyes to see.
Gary and his eyes have parted company"

Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along, singing a song
Don't mess around you just gotta be strong

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You, you belong to me now
Ain't gonna set ya free now
When those girls start hanging around, talking me down
Hear with your heart and ya won't hear a sound

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever

Young and beautiful
But someday your looks'll be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turning you on
I will, I will, I will

I will be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before and I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need ya now and I need ya then

Just stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever
I will, I will, I will, I will

You better stop 'cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinking of you

85,Raul Seixas,Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans,TRIDAVQ128F931246E,1977,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans"
86,Blue Oyster Cult,Golden Age Of Leather,TRFQQJI128F4270045,1977,"(Raise your can of beer on high)
(And seal your fate forever)
(Our best years have past us by)
(The golden age of leather)

This was the night, not long to come
In the year of our Lord A.D.
Where in a desert way-house
Poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can

And passed from man to man
A wanton child, too dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed
As nothing less than the end of an age
A last crusade, a final outrage
In this day of flaccid plumage

And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together

(Dawn colored the sky) the ritual ceased
(Some had died) they were buried with their bikes
(Each grabbed a rag) from a man with a sack
(Torn strips of color) the red and the black

I came here willingly
And I will go down valiantly
(We made a vow) to give it all we had to give
(We made a vow) to die as we had lived

They flew the colors, they began to fight
They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
The smell of oil and gas in the air

Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
The old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a solitary shaft of chromium steel

(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)

87,The Emotions,Put A Little Love Away,TRPSAJF128F428AC86,1977,"We ask a question
You have no answer
The music finds you
A sad and lonely dancer

Somehow you lost it
What everybody's looking for
But yesterday's dead and gone
Tomorrow then you'll know

Better

(CHORUS)
Put a little love away
Everybody needs a
Penny for a rainy day
Put a little love away
Keep another thought in mind
Someone's gotta leave
Somebody's gotta stay behind
Put a little love away

Two people sharing
One tear too many
Look around for miracles

You know you don't find many

I've seen it coming
But what am I supposed to do
Just take a closer look around
Simply say to you

Better

88,Elvis Costello,Welcome To The Working Week,TRDRVAO128F423360A,1977,"Now that your picture's in the paper being rhythmically admired
And you can have anyone that you have ever desired
All you gotta tell me now is why, why, why, why

Welcome to the working week
Oh I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you
Welcome to the working week
You gotta do it 'til you're through it so you better get to it

All of your family had to kill to survive
And they're still waitin' for their big day to arrive
But if they knew how I felt, they'd bury me alive

Welcome to the working week
Oh I know it don't thrill you, I hope it don't kill you
Welcome to the working week
You gotta do it 'til you're through it so you better get to it

I hear you saying, ""Hey, the city's alright""
When you only read about it in books
Spend all your money getting so convinced
That you never even bother to look

Sometimes I wonder if we're living in the same land
Why do you wanna be my friend 
When I feel like a juggler running out of hands?

Welcome to the working week
Oh, welcome to the working week"
89,The Residents,The Electrocutioner,TRZYRNN128F428E9C2,1977,"The time for all the followers of doom is drawing near,
 Deceiving no-one, knowing nothing but the bite of fear.
 
Smiling as I throw the switch
 That takes away their breath,
 I see life as an interruption
 To the tune of death
 
She is the electrocutioner...!
 
Playing with my birds, I wonder how the world could be
 A perfect place to sing about, for anyone but me.
 
I see the shimmer of the dewdrops as I drink my tea.
 And when the foolishness is over, I am much more me.
 
I wish that all the suffering and all the misery
 Could be consumed inside my room, where switches set you free.
 
*humming*
 
Where switches set you free, my friend, where switches set you free."

I want you to be around ‘til the summer comes along
And I don't mind having you around ‘til the summer comes along
Then you go and make that first mistake of trying to walk before you can even run

I wanna be by your side
I, it's so cold on this side
I wanna tell ya about love
Love that's around today
We're lovers of today

We ain't got feelings
We've got no love
We ain't got nothing to say
We're lovers of today

If we ever touched it would disturb the calm
Physical effort often causes mental harm
I don't have the energy
You could say things get pretty tranquil with me

Maybe you can't see
But I love you baby
Much more than me

When you know that's all to know
Maybe you'll just come and see the show

We ain't got feelings
We've got no love
We ain't got nothing to say
We're lovers of today
Lovers of today

Oooh it feels so right 
Lovin' you...lovin' me 

Let's stay in love 
Don't let anything in our way 
Let's stay in love 
And love will grow every day 

'Cause the world is filled with so many people 
Who once felt love so strong 
They can't remember why it slipped away 
Dyin' day by day 
Now they wonder what went wrong 

Let's stay in love 
It's the most two people can do 
Let's stay in love 
Give to me as I give to you 

We're lying underneath the stars 
In a night enchanted with love's sweet mystery 
We hold each other close and oh so tight 
So afraid we might 
Wake up from this precious dream"

And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late - but it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the lights
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late it's late it's late
But not too late

I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Too late much too late
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life alright?

It's late - but it's time to set me free
It's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late it's late it's late it's late
It's late it's late
It's all too late"
93,Barry Louis Polisar,But I'm Just Thirteen,TRAPQRP128F422B174,1977,"Mom came home from the store last night 
With groceries in her left arm and groceries in her right.
She asked me why I'd left the door unlocked 
And why I was walking 'round in my socks,
Why the dog was sleeping on my nice clean bed,
Why I hadn't done a single thing she'd said,
Why the ice cream had melted on the kitchen stove,
Why I didn't let the dog out when he had to go,
Why my friends were over for cookies and milk,
Why the cookies were gone and the milk was spilt,
Why the goldfish were missing and the cat looked fed,
And who was doing jumping jacks in her bed?
Then with groceries in hand, she went through the door,
Didn't see my roller skates lying on the floor,
She started to fall, her face turned green
And me, I said, ""but I'm just thirteen.""

There was grape juice on the ceiling and splattered on the floor
Were the peanuts and the pickles and all across the door
Were the mustard and the mayonnaise and watermelon, too,
The jelly and the jiffy pop, all sorts of gook and goo;
Like cookies on the cabinets and raisins on the rug,
And melted 'cross the tablecloth, a box of chocolate fudge,
Molasses on the light switch, syrup on the sink, 
Honey on the hot dogs, something sure did stink.
Then doggie grabbed the hamburger and kitty grabbed the steak,
And running out the open door, they ate and ate and ate.
Mom, she started yelling, you should have heard her scream,
And me, I said, ""But I'm just thirteen.""

Mom made me clean up all the mess I said I didn't do
But I cleaned it all anyway, just like she told me to
I piled garbage five feet high, can't say I didn't try
in garbage cans and boxes and bags up to the sky
When Dad came home from work, he was tired as can be
I guess he was so tired, 'Cause Daddy didn't see
The garbage I had piled and the work that was so hard;
'Cause when he hit 'em, they just splattered all across the yard
Dad of course exploded like a pot that popped it's lid
He yelled at me and said, ""Now, look what you just did.""
There was garbage in the driveway, garbage on the ground
Garbage on my Daddy, garbage all around, 
Garbage on the window, garbage on the screen
And me I said, ""But I'm Just thirteen."""

In which it gets revealed
The secrets to negotiation
Of an emotional deal

Don't know how I became
What I suddenly am
 
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
I've been searchin' so long
But the answer is finally at hand
I'm a marathon man
 
Wind is gone and my head's in a haze
But I must keep up the pace
Got to think about strategy here
If I hope to win the race
 
Someone's callin' my name
It's the crowd in the stands
Concentrate on the pain
Put my soul in command
 
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
I've been searchin' so long
But the answer is finally at hand
I'm a marathon man
 
Wasting my youth
Chasing dreams, testing truth
Taking turns being deceived
And deceivin'
Bound with a rope
Made of heroes and hope
Till I found nothin' left
To believe in
 
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'
Marathon man, keep a-runnin'

Said, what's that you're using

Put the car back in my pocket
And I'm still here in my chair

To open up your wings, turn your head to the sky,
Take off like a bird, let your heart be free. 

I found deep feeling devotion
The day that I found your love. 

I can see above the diamond-studded sky,
Hear the sound of night life passing by,
Scent the early morning with every breath of air,
Taste the secret potion that we both share. 

I found deep feeling devotion
The day I found your love."

In the shadows of her dreams
And her eyes are lookin' everywhere
But never look at me
And I should be the sucker
Who waits upon her whims
But she flicks her writ so gracefully
As she notches up her sins

I'm sinkin' so low, I said hello
I used to be one of your friends
I just got back from the South Row
And I'm out on the edge again

Sometimes I sit in the cinema
With my knees under my chin
And I drift away and watch the same part
Over and over again
The streets are so full of mysterious women
I watch them through the hole in the fence
They walk by with the sun in their eyes
And I'm out on the edge again"
106,Elvis Costello,Blame It On Cain,TRBOEUB128F423360B,1977,"Once upon a time, I had a little money
Government burglars took it long
Before I could mail it to you 
Still, you are the only one

Now, I can't let it slip away
So if the man with the ticker tape 
Tries to take it
This is what I'm gonna say

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh-oh-oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup 
And the money got low 
We could always heat it up 
And trade it in

Then the radio to heaven 
Will be wired to your purse
And you can run down the wave band
Coast to coast, hand in hand
Bad for worse, curse for curse
Don't be dissatisfied
So you're not satisfied

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh-oh-oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

I think I've lived a little too long 
On the outskirts of town
I think I'm going insane 
From talking to myself for so long

Oh but I've never been accused
When they step upon your face
They wear that good look grin
I gotta break out one weekend 
'Fore I do somebody in

But every single time 
I feel a little stronger
They tell me it's a crime
Well, how much longer?

Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh-oh-oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

Blame it on Cain
Oh-oh-oh-oh, please, don't blame it on me
It's nobody's fault
But it just seems to be his turn"

And laugh while you're bleedin'

We talk in hope to hit on something new
Tied to the railway tracks
It's one way to revive but no way to relax

We're just bored teenagers
Looking for love
Or should I say emotional rages
Bored teenagers
Seeing ourselves as strangers

We talk about the whys and wherefore
Do we really care at all?
Talk about the frailty of words
Is rarely meaningful
When we're sitting watching the 'planes
Burn up through the night like meteorites

When she was married herself nearly twenty-seven years before
She had to change the style a little but it looked just fine
They stayed up all night, but they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy, she's a-walkin' down the aisle
And she catches my eye and she gives me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old-fashioned, but we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today, she never could have then.

Well I can see her now in the tight blue jeans
Pumpin' all the money in the record machine
Spinnin' like a top, you shoulda seen her go
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll

Now her proud daddy only wanna give his little girl the best
And so he put down a grand on a cozy little lover's nest
You could've called the reception an unqualified success
At a flash hotel for a hundred and fifty guests

Take a look at the bridegroom smilin' pleased as pie
Shakin' hands all around with a glassy look in his eye
He got a real good job and his shirt and tie is nice
But I remember a time when she would never even look him twice

But I can see her now drinkin' with the boys
Breakin' their hearts like they were toys
She used to do the pony, she used to do the stroll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll

The past is dead, tomorrow's too far
All the chemicals the bars
Coloured hair and cheap tattoos
impale you on their points of view

Young savage
Young savage
Thinks like a steel wall
Stinks like a dance hall
Young savage
Young savage
Anything goes where no-one knows your name

Condemned to be a stranger
Subway dweller, dead-end agel
kicking through the dust of friends
Who never gave, they'd only lend
Every sneer is thrown away
With practised gestures of disdain
The outlaw stance is so pedantic
Hate the world, it's so romantic

Young savage

Thinks like a steel wall
Stinks like a dance hall

Anything goes where no-one knows your name"
126,Dan Hill,14 Today,TRJHHXW128F42669CD,1977,"14 today and you went dancing
Music mixed with laughter
And boys can be so insecure
They made you drink a bit too much
Everything's a blur of feel and touch
Did he really like you
How can you be sure enough

23 today and all your friends are getting married
You say they're so scared of being alone
So self righteously you march though teachers college
Still so much in life you gotta get to know
Seems like everybody's so content to move so slow

And when you think you've got your life so well controlled
It slips away
And the years like raindrops falling from your life are
Washed away
You're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so sensitive, so strong
As you hide behind your barricade of words
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard



I met you at a party you were drunk and full of world advice
And I was getting nervous
You said you had a child who was a genius and you smiled
As the living room transformed into your circus
Someone whispered you were 39 today a face so you
Eyes so old
You collapsed into the corner
Like somebody of raw nerves you near seduced me
With your verbs
As I reached out for you
You said over and over

Children come home from school
Shout and laugh with all their life
Shit em out fast before you think of the past
Turn out all your lights
Go to bed got to sleep don't think don't feel
As the night time moans a prayer
That maybe somewhere deep inside
There's some meaning aching to be shared"

I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey
A trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things
The will to stay alive

The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)

Seen a couple of things

The fields are on fire
With green bottleflies

Of me in your eyes
And why did you leave
Last summer?

Now, the seasons are changing
From summer to fall
And I've still got that picture
Hung on my wall
And there's so much forgotten
And too much recalled
And why did you leave
At all?

Standing beside you
Mid-winter day
Hearts beating close
Together.

Wishing that we'd found
Someway to make
That moment last
Forever.

Standing silent--laughing--
Breathing steam
Gazing down into a freezing
stream...

I spoke to a man down at the tracks
And I asked him how he don't go mad
He said ""Look here junior, don't you be so happy.
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad.""

Pulled up to me, all they said ""get in"" (""get in"")

Some are silk and some are leather

But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell

That you never saw the stranger?
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself?

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south
Every now and then, ooh
You've done it, why can't someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize

When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes

Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell

Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger?
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself?

Don't be afraid to try again

And he is not always wrong

Passed by not long ago
They asked me where the action was
I said I did not know
As they disappeared into the brush
I heard the driver say
He's a little slow between the ears
He's always been that way.

Well, Jolly Jane just lays around
And listens with her mouth
She's had about a dozen husbands
But the last one just pulled out
Now, who's gonna bring her dinner
Through the weary years ahead
All she'll get from me is sympathy
Ain't got time to see she's fed.

It's cold down on the bayou
They say it's in your mind

*Luke 13:24-25 - Strive to enter in at the strait gate:
for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and
shall not be able. When once the master of the house is
risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to
stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord,
Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say
unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

**Matthew 25:6 - And at midnight there was a cry made,
Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

Luke 12:35-37 - Let your loins be girded about, and
your lights burning; And ye yourselves like unto men
that wait for their lord, when he will return from the
wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open
unto him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom
the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I
say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them
to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.


***Matthew 25:1-13 - Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and
went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them
were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish
took their lamps, and took no oil with them: But the
wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While
the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those
virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish
said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps
are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, Not so;
lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather
to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they
went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was
shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying,
Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily
I say unto you, I know you not. Watch therefore, for ye
know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
cometh."

Red magic satin playing near too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins, dressed in green
Pretty music I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask or is it cool, is it cool?

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses diggin' freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

A present from you
Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few

By going steady? (break up)

I been waiting in the waiting room
And I've bin sitting in the sitting room
And now I'm whining in the dining room
Waiting for you's like waiting for the man in the moon

I was really smouldering
Seen the back of forty king size cigarettes (stood up)
This hanging round is murder
But if you'd just come along I'd have no regrets (give up)
And so I phone your number
And your mother tells me you're still in bed (get up)
When you come to the phone your voice is thick and sexy
Goes straight to my head (hang up)
And I been standing in the standing room
And I been smoking in the smoking room
And now I'm dying in the living room
I'm gonna forget what 1 came for here real soon

Your time's up and me too
I'm out on account of you

I was really burned out and smouldering
Seen the front and back of eighty king size cigarettes (stood up)
This hanging round is killing me
If you'd just creep along I'd have no regrets (give up)

You seem quite catatonic of late

Time passed and you ceased your evolution
Where is your solution now
It's over
You missed your last chance to find the answer
Before the last man becomes a madman

Do it
And when you realize that you blew it
You will look in the eyes of the madman

Thinkin' 'bout what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you
Lookin' back on you and me
Promises that will never be
I truly thought that we were lovers
But now I see you're just like all the others
Heartbreaker
Wish I'd seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
You've taken my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker
Couldn't you be just a little more kind to me
Played with fire felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I loved it every time you kissed me
Each time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me

Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs

She is watching the detectives
He's so cute
She's watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
Invisible shivers running down my spine
Cut to baby taking off her clothes
Closeup of the sign that says ""We never close""

You snatch a tune and you match a cigarette
She pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
I don't know how much more of this I can take
She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

She is watching the detectives
He's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

You think you're alone until you realize you're in it
Now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window, I wonder, who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Just like watching the detectives
Don't get cute
Just like watching the detectives

I get so angry when the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Watching the detectives

It's just like watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives"

Where angry arms can open and embrace
Where men can live together, loving one another

Save your universe, love one another

That's a big ten-four
From your back door
Just put that hammer down

Those eighteen wheels
That keep turning 'round to take me down to Shaky Town

I've heard all those hard luck tales
From all of you U.S. males

So many times we've been denied
But we can say that we're in love

We had dancin in our eyes..we had dancin' in our eyes
We lived one day at a time
We had dancin in our eyes...

I thought that we'd live there forever
And I swore that our love had to grow
But in the summertime love means December
Will surely following blowing cold

Without thinking what's round the bend
Like a drive in the country on Sunday
All soon it's got to end

And don't think that size ever makes a man small
You find out it's nothing at all

They know a tension when the old words are said
'Don't cheat in poker and don't lose your head'
Lost cowboys are human and bullets kill dead
Six guns don't make a man tall

'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proud

Do a honest day's work for the money you spend
Be fast with the ladies and slow with the man
Be kind to your horses and true to your friends
And treat every mother's son fair

Don't stay in town late on a Saturday night
Don't let no one tease you into a fight
'Cause when they're saddled with guns
There ain't nobody right
It's a short trail that leads to nowhere

'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proud

'Cause it's all so easy to run with the crowd
And they're a damn good bunch of cowboys
Makes a man feel proud"

And know that my poor soul was saved

Deny my God and doom my soul

And my head in the cool blue North.

Not a single neighbor knows our name
I know the woman wishes we would move somewhere
Where the houses aren't all the same.

Jesse, I wish you would take me where the grass is greener
I really couldn't say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a mountain top
Or down by the deep blue sea.

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze.

One day I'll be old gray grandpa
All the pretty girls will call me ""Sir""
Now, where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things were.

Well, I don't mind being an old gray grandpa
If you'll be my gray grandma
But I suggest we go have our milk and cookies
In the shade of the old paw-paw.

Now you don't see me, now you do.
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do.

I stole some tunes from the radio.
I lost my nerve but it didn't show.
I found some friends with a little faith.
Less money and no taste.

Now you don't see me, now you do.
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do.

But you've got to work at it.
What a drag.
You've got to work, work, work, work.
You can't lag behind.

I want to get this gig over, and I don't want to see it again.
But I don't want to go until it's over, and I don't want to die in pain.

I know my youth can't last forever.
I'll sing the words until I can't keep the band together no more.
Oh, to do the quickstep on a Saturday night, 
And hunt like a brave man with a flashlight.

Now you don't see me, now you do.
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do."

Não fale do medo que temos da vida

Too long between rides
Too long between homes again
Too long without someone by my side

And Lord, there's something 'bout a sad song
that helps to ease the pain...
Here I am, Lord, just singing up a storm
and I'm all alone again...

Too much going down today
just can't take it in
Too much running 'round today
can't tell you where I've been

Seems that just like singing in the only thing to do
only thing to help me pass the time
Songs are just like ladies--can't forget them when you're through
and they're always on your mind...

(CHORUS:)
And the rosewood bitters
Help me meet the sunshine in the morning
And the rosewood bitters
Help me through the night
When I feel blue

Too few stop to pass the time
Guess that's how it goes
So sure that there's much more than this
when really no one knows

And easing into midnight
as the bitters pass around
crying in my beer
Singing someone else's troubles
help to ease your own
Goodnight, Irene, my dear...

Blue and bittersweet
You tear my dreams apart

Cause I was born to be bad
I'm not sad
And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad, why don't you all get with it

The damned don't cry
Cry out when they're betrayed
Bodies slam they scream
As the keynotes fade

And I'm glad I did it
Born to be bad
I'm not sad, why don't you all get with it

And I said ""Mom, I just called to tell ya I joined a rock and roll band
And I won't be coming home no more""
You know what she did?
She started crying and weeping and whimpering like all mothers do
She woke up my father and told him about it and he said
""There ain't a damn thing we can do, that's the way she is
Hey, you know she was just born to be bad""

I want you to bring me his ears
To satisfy my mad desires
And if he bites the dust
We'll just have to miss my fire

In a silver plane
A subway train
The man was standing there

All around the world
The boys and girls
Are looking for the same

The wheels are rolling
All around the world
The wheels of fortune
Let me see you turn

Ticket for a destination
Aboard the new sensation
A wondering son
The lucky one
A London boy in flight

Looking for the satisfaction
Of that rock 'n' roll reaction
Heres an invitation
A reservation
For all to hear the band

Long races at fast paces

Comprane un pò anche tu

Impara un'altra verità:
A fare il profeta, mai
Nessuno ci guadagnerà!"

That's what she's telling everybody
But one or two parties baby your all through your not too much 
Good for anything

Now them party girls they gonna break your heart in two
And just when you think your finished 
She gonna tell you your all finished too

And then she looks at me
Says I'm on my way home
And I say to myself
I I I don't want to be alone
So I take her by the arm 
And I walk her home
That's what what I'm gonna do

Can I steal you blind can I make you all mine
Love you till the moon has lost its shine 
Take me down those hot dusty roads

And the clouds runnin' silver and gold
I'm runnin' too scared to know that I'm goin' down slow
Stay by my side be my friend and my guide
Make me feel glad I'm alive
And cold are the rains I'm too tired to remain
A victim of circumstance again

I'm runnin' too scared to know that I'm goin' down slow

rør dem, og de blekner bort
Ennå kan du høre
blodet banke i ditt øre
Hjertet slår så rart og fort
Bare dette brevet
At du har nektet ham å leve
og at han vil ha det unnagjort

Skyggen i din seng trekker hurtig hånden til seg
men avstanden er litt for kort
Han som tente flammen
tok seg kaldt og kraftig sammen
og gikk og fikk det unnagjort

Han sa han alltid dra fra dem han ble for glad i
Han sa han alltid lengtet etter noe nytt
Han kunne le, han kunne gråte
men han viste aldri når han var seg selv
Og så: Far vel

Stillheten er stygg. Du lytter etter skritt i trappen
eller knirking fra din port
Om du kunne skrike
som da du var liten pike
når du hadde gått deg bon!
Men han har bare fått deg
og du har bare falt og slått deg
Dermed er det unnagjort

Han sa hver bolig ble en borg med lite lys i
Han sa at frihet var en uke i hver by
Du så ham gi, du så ham kreve
og du ga deg selv og alt han viJle ha og lot ham dra

Sorgen skaper sang - som de glade gjerne synger
for å jage sorgen bort
Selv den minste krise
blir en linje til en vise
Alt må skje så varmt og fort
Og nå er sangen ferdig
Den er pikens skjebne verdig
Han har kalt den: Unnagjort"

There's a place to be

Here we are.

Let yourself go by,
You can touch the sky
If you try.

All you've got to show 
You may never know, what you are.
If you ever try, 
Can you tell me why, why you are.

Only you will know 
And you picked your show.
Can you tell me though, 
Will you know?

If you feel like me 
You can't help but please

I made three hundred calls today,
Though yours is the only voice that I wanna hear
I got to make me a living someway.

I know you hate me doing this
You say I'm selling out,
But how in the hell is a mad s'posed to live?
Selling's what it's all about.

Hello, Sir, I'm the Pocono Land
Development Company,
And I'm calling you with an offer of some land
That you'll just have to see.
A quarter-acre plot, that's what I've got for you
Nineteen ninety-five, four hundred dollars down
And just ten bucks a week
It's two short hours from New York City,
A Pocono Land Site green and pretty.
There's lakes there, and trout streams,
Mountain views, Country Dreams,
Country Dreams.

We dreamed our dreams in college, girl
Back then we thought we should,
And we promised that we would save the world
Way back then we thought we could.

I know you love your teaching now, but I wish you'd understand,
There aren't that many jobs around, I'm doing the best I can.

Hello, Sir...

I'm here with forty other guys
Crowded in a room,
Making a living selling the moon
And rustic dreams in June.
I used to hate the city now I'm dwelling in it,
Used to love the country now I'm selling it.
I'm doing well at it,
That's the hell of it!

I said that we would find a farm 
And live out on the land,
It's strange how dreams come back at us 
In ways that we had never planned.
Here I'm selling real estate 
And laughing at myself,
If I can't have my country dream 
I'm gonna sell it out to somebody else!

Darling, don't get mad at me
I'm doing this for you,
It's really not so sad to see we had
Growing up to do.
Please don't push me anymore
It's gonna work out fine,
I know I said I'd quit before
But just give me a little more time."

She was standing at the load-in
When the trucks rolled up
She was sniffing all around
Like a half grown female pup
She wasn't hard to talk to
Looked like she had nowhere to go
So I gave her my pass
So she could get in and see the show

Well I sat her down right next to me
And I got her a beer
While I mixed that sound on the stage
So the band could hear
The more I watched her watch them play
The less I thought of to say
And when they walked off stage
The drummer swept that girl away

But Rosie you're all right -- you wear my ring
When you hold me tight -- Rosie that's my thing
When you turn out the light -- I got to hand it to me
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie

Well I guess I might have known from the start
She'd come for a star
Might have told my imagination not to run too far
Of all the times that I've been burned
By now you'd think I'd have learned
That it's who you look like
Not who you are

(You all keep that in mind)

But Rosie you're all right -- you wear my ring
When you hold me tight -- Rosie that's my thing
When you turn out the light -- I've got to hand it to me
Looks like it's me and you again tonight ,Rosie
Looks like it's me and you again tonight...
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie

Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker
And always cued-up a ball
Thinking he was one rack away
But even when you run the table
The check still seems small
When it's your last payday

The shallow pocket changer
Who always took advantage of strangers
Tried to make a five-grand grab
With a split second getaway
But he forgot that a bag of money
Ain't worth much on a slab
When it's your last payday

That line about luck just can't be bought
You're always lucky 'til you get caught
Trouble will find you, no need to look
And luck won't help when they close the book

I know a lot of young fellas in here
Especially those on the highest tier
Still want to believe
That Santa comes in a sleigh
They're right about the long white beard
But wrong about Christmas Eve
What's Christmas, when it's your last payday"

Turns friends to strangers
Your needs once more denied

It'll leave you far-ar behind

Before I lose my mi-i-i-i-i-ind

And laughed as it sai-ailed through space

'Cause so many things these days have been crushed
In the name of lo-o-ove

Actin' strong again as if you don't really need me
But the weakness that you once betrayed
Turned to be the strength that freed me
And I won't ask a thing of you
That you're not secure in giving of
'Cause so many things these days have been crushed
In the name of lo-ove

Now I know it's not that easy
When you don't know where you stand
At times I think I've never stood at all
Look around you'll see for every woman, child and man
Love has played its games upon us all

Playin' roles again both actin' so defensive
As if some pre-programmed machine
Took over all our senses
I'd trade everything I own
For the thrill of fa-a-allin' in love
'Cause so many things these days have been saved
In the name - of lo-ove"

Get your feet back on the ground

When you're down
And no one wants you
And you wonder who you are
When your friends
They don't desert you
When you make it you're a star

But I'm gonna stay free and easy
I know just what I am
I'm gonna be free and easy

Well, I've been through
All the heartaches
And I've been through all the pain
But when you're up and riding high
Everybody stakes their claim

Cause every where your turnin', 
You can't escape the fact...

Step on it man you know they're gainin' ground,

Fear for me…

Johnny didn't mean to do it, 
But he was real scared, 
Outlaws, runnin' hidin', who knows where, 
Next time your on the outskirts,

Y tú no cambiaste por fuertes
Que fueran los vientos
Es tu corazón una casa de puertas abiertas
Tu eres realmente el más cierto
En horas inciertas

En ciertos momentos difíciles
Que hay en la vida
Buscamos a quien nos ayude
A encontrar la salida
Y aquella palabra de fuerza
Y de fe que me has dado
Me da la certeza que
Siempre estuviste a mi lado

Tú eres mi amigo del alma
En toda jornada
Sonrisa y abrazo festivo
A cada llegada
Me dices verdades tan grandes
Con frases abiertas
Tú eres realmente el más cierto
De horas inciertas

Todo eso que te digo
Pero es bueno así sentir

Through a fault of our designing
We are lost among the windings
Of these metal ways
Back to silence back to minus
With the purple sky behind us

Nobody hears us when we're alone in the blue future

281,The Boomtown Rats,Kicks,TRADYCV128E0784CFD,1977,"I don't get my kicks no more from cake or lemonade
Bud I can't get served no smokes or drinks
They tell me that I'm underage

At sixteen years old I don't stand a chance
but on Saturday when I get to the dance
It's time-out from life
Got to learn to boogaloo
'Cos I get my kicks from you

Summer's gone school's back I feel so black inside
Rules and regulations are a torture rack
Is there no place for me left to hide?

At sixteen years old things have gone too far
I wanna be a movie rocker soccer star
But when you're around I know you'll treat me good
I get my kicks from you

I dream of you at night
Do you really mean anything at all,
Or am I wasting my time on you?

Those other guys are so much cooler than me
I find it so hard to score
What's it really like to know a girl
My imagination's not enough I gotta know more

At sixteen years old I get frightened at night
Presented with the truth I'm afraid I take flight
But when you're around I know you'll treat me good
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you
