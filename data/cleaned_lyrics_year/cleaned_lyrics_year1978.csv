0,The Members,Solitary Confinement,TRTKBTM128F14690A8,1978,"You are living in the suburbs,
And you have problems with your parents,
So you move on up to London town,
Where you think everything's happening, going down.
 
Living in a bedsit,
Travelling on a tube train,
Working all day long.
And you know no one,
So you don't go out,
And you eat out of tins,
And you watch television,
Solitary confinement.
 
I have got a good job,
And I am working in the city,
Get the tube train at 8 o'clock and 5,
And a really don't know if I'm dead or alive.
 
Living in a bedsit,
Travelling on a tube train,
Working all day long.
And you know no one,
So you don't go out,
And you eat out of tins,
And you watch television,
Solitary confinement.
 
Well I was living in Camberley, and, you know, I thought I'd move up to town, you know, so I got this bedsit on earls court, and like, not many people come to visit me, in fact no one comes at all, but there's this bird across the way who, I mean I know she fancies me and everything, but well, I got it sussed, she got a 40 inch bust, and she's just...just just!
 
Living in a bedsit,
Travelling on a tube train,
Working all day long.
And you know no one,
So you don't go out,
And you eat out of tins,
And you watch television,
Solitary confinement.
 
You're so lonely,
Solitary confinement,
You're so lonely,
Solitary confinement.
 
The Members are going to tell you what it's like to be
 
On your own
By yourself
On your own
By yourself
On your own

On your own

Buy yourself this record
 
And it's lonely for you,
And it's lonely for me,
And it's lonely for all of us, can't you see?
 
Living in a bedsit,
Travelling on a tube train,
Working all day long.
And you know no one,
So you don't go out,
And you eat out of tins,
And you watch television,
Solitary confinement"
1,Rose Royce,Love Don't Live Here Anymore,TRZNPUM128F4259419,1978,"You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore"
2,Rick James,You And I,TRLGBCG128F93225DA,1978,"You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand, that's right
And don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere you wanted to go
You and me
We are as close as two part harmony, wouldn't you agree
And given the chance
Our romance in the end would surely be the end of me

(Some people must say I'm infatuated with you
I don't care 'cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear the things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned they all can go to hell
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo)

You and I
Will be together 'til the six is nine, that's right
And when you need me
I never hesitate, I always come - it's so much fun
You and I
Although we're poor our love has greater wealth than Hughes himself
And given the chance
That there's an afterlife when we die, it's with you and I

(Some people must say I'm infatuated with you
I don't care 'cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear the things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned they all can go to hell
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo)"
3,Gladys Knight & The Pips,The One And Only,TRUREEP128F9338EEB,1978,"When you find the one and only
It's like findin' a needle in the hay
Ev'ryone of us is lookin' for love
So when love comes along

You can't let it get away
When you're someone's one and only
And he says that he's nothin' without you
When at last you know where you belong

Then you're one of the chosen few
Yes, you're one of the chosen few
Well I found my one and only
Like the long, lonesome river finds the sea

And I can't believe how lucky I was
That you and your love were waitin' around for me
You're my darlin' one and only
I've got no more lookin' left to do

With a love as sweet as ours
I know that I'm one of the chosen few
Yes, I'm one of the chosen few"
4,Rachel Sweet,Cuckoo Clock,TRDHBGX128F428E658,1978,"What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!
What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!

[Look inside the clock!  There's a little toy singer!]

I'm a toy singer, so don't be alarmed, if I sound real, I am real 
I'm a toy.
They wound me up to tell futures, the Eighties will be a joy
Joy rhymes with toy.

And this clock I live in's got
Cute small things inside.

[Look what's inside the clock!]

Dirty streets, sweatshops, and scrapyards and bars
All perfectly reproduced.
Little sharp things that will prick you and make make make make make you do things
Buy things
Self-induced.

And this clock I live in's got
Cute small things inside.

What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!
What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!

[Quick!  Lock it back up!   Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!]

Once it's unlocked it's for keeps and the beasties are free to go
They leap to the deck.
And the toy singer, that's me, this clock's made me a nervous wreck
Where's my check?

[Oh! That! Clock! She! Lives! In's! Got!]
[Cute! Small! Things! In! Siiiiiide!]

What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!
What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!
What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!
What's in the cuckoo clock?  Don't leave the thing unlocked!"
5,Abba,Summer Night City,TRCFZGQ128F92EFF0E,1978,"Summer night city
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark (Summer night city)
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park (Summer night city)

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free, aha

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo

Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark (Summer night city)
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park (Summer night city)

It's elusive, call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone

I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere, aha

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo

And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering

It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark (Summer night city)
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park (Summer night city)

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark (Summer night city)
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park (Summer night city)

Waiting for the sunrise
Soul dancing in the dark (Summer night city)
Walking in the moonlight
Love-making in a park (Summer night city)"

I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's goin' my way
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear 

I'm gettin' ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm gettin' ready to cruise 
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party! 

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
Yea there's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie 

So come on
Get ready for the time of your life
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party! 

Yea yea yea yea get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet some friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud 

Get ready for a party tonight
'Cause I'm gettin' right in the groove 
And if you've got somethin' for me 
I've got somethin' for you 

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there 
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party!

He's got to have some lovin' each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright"
8,Chic,Savoir Faire,TRTQPEJ12903CD7601,1978,"Dog man star took a suck on a pill
And stabbed a cerebellum with a curious quill
Europe, America, Winterland

Introducing the band

Chic thug stuttered through a stereo dream
A fifty knuckle shuffle heavy metal machine
The tears of suburbia drowned the land

Introducing the ban&amp;100

So steal me a savage, subservient son
Get him shacked-up, bloodied-up and sucking on a gun
I want the style of a woman, the kiss of a man

And as the sci-fi lullaby starts to build
See them whipping all the women, cracked governments killed
Oh let the century die to violent hands

9,The Police,Can't Stand Losing You,TRFDFQK128F1492377,1978,"I've called you so many times today
And I guess it's all true what your girlfriends say
That you don't ever want to see me again
And your brother's gonna kill me, and he's six feet ten
I guess you'd call it cowardice
But I'm not prepared to go on like this

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you

I see you sent my letters back
And my LP records, and they're all scratched
I can't see the point in another day
When nobody listens to a word I say
You can call it lack of confidence
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

I guess this is our last goodbye
And you don't care, so I won't cry
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
And all this guilt will be on your head
I guess you'd call it suicide
But I'm too full to swallow my pride

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling the light
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile when you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

You're my song
Music too magic to end

Doing anything my radio advised 
With every one of those late night stations 
Playing songs bringing tears to my eyes 
I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver 
When the switch broke 'cause it's old 
They're saying things that I can hardly believe 
They really think we're getting out of control 

Radio is a sound salvation 
Radio is cleaning up the nation 
They say you better listen to the voice of reason 
But they don't give you any choice 'cause they think that it's treason 
So you had better do as you are told 
You better listen to the radio 

I wanna bite the hand that feeds me 
I wanna bite that hand so badly 
I want to make them wish they'd never seen me 

Some of my friends sit around every evening 
And they worry about the times ahead 
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference 
And the promise of an early bed 
You either shut up or get cut up, they don't wanna hear about it 
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel 
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools 
Tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel 

Wonderful radio 
Marvelous radio 
Wonderful radio

Do what you want, girl, but be what you are
There ain't no right or wrong way
Just a play from the heart
It ain't a sign of weakness, girl, to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on
While the weak, the weak give up and stay

So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are 
Be what you are ...

Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...

Do you believe in hot cars,
Leather bars, and movie stars --
Is that what's real?
Payin' dues, in earth shoes, Chicago blues --
Is that how you feel? 
You can change, you can change, you can change, you can change
But you can't conceal
What's deep inside you
It's your game, it's your deal
It's your game, it's your deal

So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are 
Be what you are ...

Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...

Do what you want to, girl
You can be what you want to
You can do what you want to
You can do, you can be
You could do, you could be
You can..."

People don't grow on trees
And you can't treat people like meat
Without getting brought to your knees

Since I hit this town
Like to jump in the river and drown
Feeling like a one man woman
Living in a two time town

Sometimes I'd like
To get out on the floor
Shake it till dawn
Some young thing
Like to teach him the bump
Make me want to take him home
Well excuse me
I don't mean to preach no lectures
Yeah but me and my man won't
Be able to stay for breakfast

And I'm just a bitch

We just went and shut the crazy world outside

So we ran in the darkness
'Til the morning light arrived
And we felt ourselves so lucky to be alive

The sirens called us out on the street
The cold wind knocked us down to our knees

All the good times were stolen
On the streets just a soulin', soulin'
Like a stone, we were rollin'
On the streets, just a soulin', soulin'
Out in the night, feelin' just right again

Well, the girl was such a mystery
And the day was never done
We were anticipating what was to come

So if the talk wasn't easy
At least the feeling was so right
In the deep blue persuasiveness of the night

And if you thought of changin' your mind
Somethin' else was easy to find

All the good times were stolen
On the streets just a soulin', soulin'
Like a stone, we were rollin'
On the streets, just a soulin', soulin'
Out in the night, feelin' just right again

While the days just kept us down

All my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms
She's following after
The King of all Places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
Who walks without shining a light
She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know til it's night

All my love's softness,
All my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove
She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
Who stands with her flock
all alone on the hill
Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning, and you never will."

40,Bruce Springsteen,Racing In The Street,TRQIKIR128F42745BB,1978,"I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a 396
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
She's waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down

Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow 'em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racing in the street

We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the north east state
When the strip shuts down we run 'em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little, piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racing in the street

Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow 'em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world, we're going racing in the street

I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs ""Baby did you make it all right""
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands

Tonight tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For racing in the street"

She had the child he'll never know
She knew love until it got a little slow
And why he left she'll never know

And in a lonely tenement
???
She had no way to pay her rent
And all her money had been spent
She couldn't get a compliment
???
In a lonely tenament
A lonely tenament

In a lonely union hall
He's waiting for some work to call
Waiting for his raise to fall
Got his ass against the wall
He's giving them his all and all
They're expecting for him to crawl
In a lonely hall
A lonely tenement

Well there were times when his work came easily
When he could stand up and feel free
He even dreamed of raising a family
Something that now will never be

Well in a bar in her neighborhood
She remembers when it was good
Or was it that she understood
All her crummy neighborhood
She'd buy a round if she only could
??? drink it if she only would
In a bar in her neighborhood
A lonely neighborhood
A loney tenement

Looks at her life and wonders where did it all go
She'll never know"

for the speeches;
Let me leave you with a line-

Might help you pass the time...
sometime.
You might as well smile
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain
Keeps on falling
You might as well smile
Ain't no pain gonna change what
still remains
You might as well maintain, babe,
Protect your sanity, your sanity, and
Shine it on, babe. Shine It On Me.

I remember times when you'd touch me
And you'd, you'd freeze my spine.
We were looking in the mirror at the time
I got confused and thought your eyes were mine

Might help you pass the time... sometime.
You might as well smile
Ain't no tears gonna drown the rain
Keeps on falling
You might as well smile
Ain't no pain gonna change what
still remains
You might as well regain, babe
Your lost serenity, serenity, and
Shine it on, babe. Shine It On Me."

On the southern sea
And it whirls around
Deep inside of me
Always bringing me up
Never letting me down
I had a dream I was on my way
To Bridgetown

I've seen ships that sail
Each and every day
And when they start up their engines


They steal my heart away

Than go with a boy or two
Even though the neighborhood
Thinks I'm trashy and no good
I suppose it could be true
But there are worse things I could do

I could flirt with all the guys
Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance
Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr. Right
Take cold showers everyday
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal and I don't lie
But I can feel and I can cry
A fact I'll bet you never knew
But to cry in front of you
That's the worst thing I could do"

Red choo-choo trains and the meanest little boys,
And the most innocent little girls,
And you know,
I wish that I could go there,
It's a road that I have not found,
And I wish you the best of luck dear,
Drop a card or letter to my side of town,
Cause there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend,
But baby I'm amazed by the hate that you, can send and you,
Painted my entire world but I,
Don't have the turpentine to clean
What you have soiled
And I won't forget it
There's a place where everyone can be right,
Even though you remain determined to be opposed,
Admittance requires no qualifications,
It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes,
So please try not to be impatient,
For we all hate standing in line,
And when the farm is good and bought,
You'll be there without a thought,
And eternity my friend, is a long fucking time."

Down on your knees
With your face to the wall
Saying please, please, please
My friend said I should call

Well, I do feel lonely, woman
To tell the truth
I could use some company
So come closer to me
Help yourself to a taste of my love

Call up room service
Order peaches and cream
I like my dessert first
If you know what I mean

Yeah, taste it, taste it, taste it
Around the maze of pleasure
To the gates of pain
You're driving me insane
Take all you need from a taste of my love

I want to love you
Like nobody ever loved you
Get on my stallion
And we'll ride

I want to hold you
And enfold you beyond reason
I want to dynamite your mind
With love tonight

Go down gently
With your face to the east
The sun may be rising
But we haven't finished the beast

Ooh, you still look hungry, woman
I'm glad your came in here
With your eyes so bright
On this long hot night
Ooh, you need love, I need love
Here it comes, the taste of my love

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody ever loved you
Climb on my rocket
And we'll fly

Over the moon
Past the sun till we find
The gates of heaven
Open wide for lovers

But cellophane don't move me and can't turn my life around
You're the nicest piece of heart and soul 
That I have ever found I've ever found. 

You're not a Farrah, or a Brigitte, or a Raquel pussy cat
Twenty generations of girls have tried to look like that
But class like yours ain't on the screen 
And it's finally made me think
You can lead this horse to Hollywood 
But you cannot make me drink (can't make him drink). 

Chorus:
I love you honey, you're the one for me
And it comes naturally ...
I don't want an image, I dont' want a movie star
I just want you baby the way you are. 

You don't fill out the old bikini like a playboy bunny doll
In fact in that department you've got little there at all.
But in modern times we've gone beyond 
The Tarzans and the Janes
While some just use their bodies 
Others use their brains, darling, remember brains? 

(Chorus) 

Bogart called them ""baby"", Sinatra called them ""dames""
And Boyer calls them ""ladies"", (Norman Mailer calls us names)
But I don't need a label to know what you mean to me
So I'll just make it simple and call you frequently

'Cause we build a strong love affair
On investments of equal share
Two hearts that beat as one
Just look what love has done

Just like money in my pocket, baby love

They were young and they had each other

He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancin' there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far, Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two

There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind

She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind!

And Lord, I can't throw it away

And where do I put her memory
When it's always in my mind
I can't chase it, erase it, I just have to face it

Where she used to lay her head
I've picked up her hairpins and curlers

I'm on the edge of danger, and I'll run by night
I'm on the phone to summer, so I;ll see you on the flight
My friends are at a party, playing games with the light
I hate to say I'm wrong, I just know I'm right

We all run by night

Should I kid myself that I have no fear?
I get no choice, I just have to wait
It may already be too late

I don't know what's going on
She is here, but I am gone
I am gone

My love is lying here
She's far away though she looks so near
""Time will tell,"" she says to me
When a warm coat is all I need

Her peace of mind, her strength of will
It will come, she's sure it will
But how can I put my mind at rest?
I feel I'm coming off second best

And I'm cut with my own knife
Is this a dream or is it real life?
Oh, sleep, come o'er me soon
I can't bear this lonely room

Look at that head lying there
The room is dark, she shows no fear
I'm lying still, my eyes are wide
My heart is pumping, I'm still alive

I'm still awake against my will
What will it ever take to still
This burning in me?

And I'm cut with my own knife
Is this a dream or is it real life?
Oh, sleep, come o'er me soon
I can't bear this lonely room

Sleep, come o'er me soon

A comfort to the fool who's restless in his mind
The lover's trusty potion, you little glass of wine.

Little glass of wine, you're oil on my flame
Shy of the sunlight, hiding your shame
And many, many tears, the number is sublime
Shall stain a woman's bosom,for a little glass of wine.

As soon as you learn that you don't live forever
You'll grow fond of the fruit of the vine
So here is to you and here is to me
And here is to the ones we've left behind, oh, yeah yeah yeah.

Little glass of wine sure makes the party gay
It will seal a lover's bargain, it will chase the blues away
So if you're feeling low and you want to rest your mind
Well, just run and fetch another little glass of wine

When it comes to business take off like a jet
Rocking's her vocation, she's a very high roadette

Young man slow down your hustle bustle
You can take your time, young man
Some of this is muscle

Lightning on her leg, spitfire on her hip
Rock 'n' roll's a habit, guitar wrote the script
Messed up on her history, won the schooling prize
Does her heavy thinking with her Bristols and her thighs

Never had a teacher messing with her brain
You should see her pupils, music's in her veins
Shifting her transmission like Chevolet Corvette
Rock 'n' roll relations with a very high roadette

Change my colour it's a dare
Change my face and my hair

Don't want to be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don't want to feel the cold nights bite
In and out of my life

Fascinated for a while
It's the colour of your smile
And there's plain there's nothing free
It's not good enough for me

It's a break up such a made up
What do you desire
No more fake up need a shake up
What do you desire

I took a road I'd never been
I met a stranger by the way
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear

Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' in a slide zone

He told me where a river flows
He showed me how the apple grows
He told me of a magic stream
His face was worn but his eyes were clear

Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' in a slide zone
Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' through a time zone

He went to find a shooting star
Around the bend that's where they are
I went along just for the ride
Suddenly I began to glide

Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' through a time zone

The air raced by there was no sound
We drifted high above the ground
And then said you know this place
And then a smile lit up his face

Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' in a slide zone
Standing in a slide zone
I could be steppin' through a time zone

I turned my head and looked below
And there was something there I know
Suddenly I began to fall
I looked around and tried to call

Standing in a slide zone
He had me steppin' in a time zone
Standing in a slide zone
Falling through a time zone

Help me please I thought I said
Then something happened in my head
Music came from all around
And I knew what I had found

I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
You said that I could stay
See you through to another day.

Time flies in this atmosphere
Aeroplanes and crashing cars
Automatic in the head my dreams of you.

Bring telescopes and read the stars
They say the future's ours to penetrate
Electric-eye sees all within
A polaroid life you and I begin.

The city dwellers drop like flies
Delirium and madness in their eyes
In bowls of blue and water-glass
My angel-fish and I, we pass the time away.

It's worth the wait, surreal estate
Surreal estate, no time, no date
Accept no fake surreal estate
Design by fate, surreal estate.

I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
Ancient orchards in the rain
Magnetic fields and railway trains.

Here beneath our haunted moon
In a room of green we disappear
Invisible to all the world we practice sleeping
Keeping time by nothing clear.

With new precision the golden days return
The lovers prison, the kingdom of the worm
Driving through empty towns, pass me a cigarette
I think that it could rain, in time we all forget.

Your tape-recorder-heart spins through a hundred feelings
The program for tonight to send my senses reeling
Beyond the final portal, behind the iron gates
Our lady of illusion, the guardian demon waits, she waits.

Beware the falling ones, don't look into their eyes
See what tomorrow brings, a hint of genocide
This is the last resort, the world is closing down
Now is the dying season, let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea
Let's walk into the sea."

You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be

Now, it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

My, oh my, a sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song and wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Staying together forever, breaking up never

It's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
And it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
My, my, my

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone, left this emptiness
I only reminisce the happiness we spent
We used to dance to the music, make romance to the music

Now, it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
Now, it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone
My, my, my

Well, it's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning since you've been gone

And turned cartwheels across the floor 
I was feeling kind of seasick 
The crowd called out for more 
The room was humming harder 
As the ceiling flew away 
Whe we called out for another drink 
The waiter brought a tray 

And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face at first just ghostly 
Turned a whiter shade of pale 

She said there is no reason 
And the truth is plain to see 
But I wandered through my playing cards 
Would not let her be 
One of sixteen vestal virgins 
Who were leaving for the coast 
At the moment my eyes were open 
They might just as well have been closed 

And so it was that later 
As the miller told his tale 
That her face at first just ghostly 
Turned a whiter shade of pale"

Playing with your dress
Underneath your Pac-a-Mac

And then a voice from afar in the back of my car
Whispered 'Gay Paris'
And looking ever so French the bohemian dream
You said 'bonjour mon ami'

When I moved into my studio flat
Hot sticky nights
In the summertime in bedsitland

And they said 'mais oui ce soir,

Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said you moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon

Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon

I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back, and they still care you know

One love behind

A bald adolescent, asks me out for a fight
He was no bigger than a two-penny fart
He was a deft exponent of the martial art
He gave me three warnings:
Trod on me toes, stuck his fingers in my eyes
And kicked me in the nose
A rabbit punch made me eyes explode
My head went dead, I fell in the road 

I pleaded for mercy
I wriggled on the ground
He kicked me in the balls
And said something profound
Gave my face the millimetre tread
Stole me chop suey and left me for dead 

Through rivers of blood and splintered bones
I crawled half a mile to the public telephone
Pulled the corpse out the call box, held back the bile
And with a broken index finger, I proceeded to dial 

I couldn't get an ambulance
The phone was screwed
The receiver fell in half
It had been kung fu'd 

A black belt karate cop opened up the door
Demanding information about the stiff on the floor
He looked like an extra from Yang Shang Po
He said ""What's all this then
Ah so, ah so, ah so.""
He wore a bamboo mask
He was gen'ned on zen
He finished his devotions and he beat me up again 

Thanks to that embryonic Bruce Lee
I'm a shadow of the person that I used to be
I can't go back to Salford
The cops have got me marked

Exit Johnny Clarke"

To steer clear of her charm

And reindeer drawing a sleigh

There troubled with snow covered peaks

And a friend of mine - no

And so easily led
There just happen to be repercussions
Months ahead

Oh there troubled with snow covered peaks
Till the end of time
We know you're a daughter of Eve
And a friend of mine - no"

She's with him, it drives me wild
I'd like to hit him on the head
Until he's dead
The sight of blood is such a high
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo

We made it on a ballroom blitz
I took his arm and kissed his lips
He looked at me with such a smile
My face turned red
We booked a room into the Ritz
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gives me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo

And though I'm only just fifteen
I like to kick, I like to scream
And even if I have a kick or two in bed
When I'm with him it's just a dream
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gives me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo

The other day, what a surprise
I saw him with some other guys
God he was dressed up
With a girl around his neck
I could have cried with both my eyes
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
He gave me head

And if or when I make it through
Or if my brain is stuck on glue
And when the world tries to forget
All that I've said
I'll still remember you
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
You gave me head

Jet boy, jet girl
Gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make him penetrate
I'm gonna make you be a girl
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
A laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem

That was Laura but she's only a dream

I don't have much to say,
Daylight sneakin' through the window
And I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow,
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow.

Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand,
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand.
If I had wings and I could fly,
I know where I would go.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow.

People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah,
Makes you stop and all wonder why.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry.
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow.

People disagreeing everywhere you look,
Makes you wanna stop and read a book.
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook.
But this ol' river keeps on rollin', though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow,
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow.

Watch the river flow,
Watchin' the river flow,
Watchin' the river flow,
But I'll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow."

He went to the mountain early in the mornin'
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord
Just to hear his hammer ring.
Just to hear his hammer ring, Lord, Lord

When John Henry was a little baby,
Sittin' on his daddy's knee
He picked up a hammer, a little piece of steel,
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me
Said hammer be the death of me, Lord, Lord
Said hammer be the death of me

Said he didn't have but a dime

I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine
I'll get it from the man in the mine, Lord, Lord
I'll get it from the man in the mine

Said the captain, what can you do
I can hoist a jack, I can lay a track
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too

Well the captain said to John Henry,
Gonna bring me a steam drill 'round
Gonna bring me a steam drill out on the job
Gonna whup that steel on down, Lord, Lord
Whup that steel on down

Well John Henry said to the captain,
Oh a man ain't nothin' but a man
'Fore I'd let your steam drill beat me down,
I'd die with my hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord
Die with my hammer in my hand

Well John Henry said to the captain,
Looka yonder what I see,
Hole done choke, drill done broke,
And you can't drive steel like me, Lord, Lord
Can't drive steel like me
Oh no, you can't drive steel like me, no no
Can't drive steel like me

Well John Henry drove into the mountain,
His hammer was strikin' fire
He drove so hard he broke his poor heart
And he laid down his hammer and he died, Lord, Lord
Laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died, Great God
Laid down his hammer and he died

Oh they took John Henry to the White House
And they buried him in the sand
Every locomotive come roarin' by
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man
Says there lies a steel drivin' man, Lord, Lord
There lies a steel drivin' man

Shaker why don't you sing,
I'm throwin' twelve pounds from my hips on down,
Just listen to the cold steel ring,
Just listen to the cold steel ring

Well the Captain says to John Henry
I believe this mountains cavin' in
John Henry said to the Captain,
'T ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind,
'T ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind

And do what everybody says,
Or get carried away.
Nowadays I fall among the empty shells and pray.
Give thanks - I'm happy where I am.

Thank God I never compromised.

An anarchist on your street.
There's a breakdown on your T.V.

In fact no feelings at all.
Your war is totally internal.

Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade
It shattered the edge of the night

Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands

When a movement behind hit the side of my mind
I trembled and shook it away
Then another assault and I started to falter
Fibres of steel turned to clay

With a bubbly turn now the water should churn
And push it way from the core
And the lady in white will bring sun to the night
Brighter than ever before

I know she waits below
Only to rise on command

Has shattered the edge of the night

Blinded and bruised by the strain

We leaned in the cold, holding our breath, watching the corners turn corners.
Coins on the table, the cards in the air, the face at the window kept smiling.
Storms all that winter we stayed locked away.
Waiting. Watching. Falling.

End of the street. Horizon retreats.
You ran with it. I wish I could.
Sleep is not sleep. My eyes repeat.
You take the voltage that watches you weep.
You caught the voice. I listen close.
All I heard was the echoes.

Praise emptiness.
Her rose-colored dress.
Her circling motions.
Praise emptiness.
Everything scattered, nothing was missed.
We took our house in the fire."

Tes paupières de fièvre
Sont à moi, sont à moi
Tes frayeurs, tes rêves
Sont à moi, sont à moi, sont à moi

Jaloux
Oui jaloux
Jaloux et jaloux de tout

Quand tu t'en vas seule vers d'autres affaires
Je sais toujours où tu es sur la terre
Je gagne toujours au jeu d'colin maillard
Les yeux bandés méme quand il fait noir
Tes hanches qui m'enchaînent
Sont à moi, sont à moi
Tes yeux en colère
Sont à moi, sont à moi, sont à moi

Jaloux
Oui jaloux
Jaloux et jaloux de tout

Ne venez pas traîner sur mes falaises
Où mon amour se promène à son aise
Même si ce n'est que pour nous regarder
Un accident est si vite arrivé

Tes jours dans la lumière
Sont à moi, sont à moi
Tes nuits, leurs mystères
Sont à moi, sont à moi, sont à moi

Oui jaloux

Jaloux et jaloux de tout"

You were just still written I couldn't play
Then I wasn't so sure of my old day
What is the reason, you wouldn't say
Never returned to Boston
The place where my love was lost and
Oh baby, what's it causing me

Look for your face in the railway station
Thought it was you but now I'm mistaken
Where do I look in this great big passion for you

Stuck on the turnpike
It's taking me days to hitch-hike
Ain't no love like me and you
Stuck on the turnpike
It's taking me days to hitch-hike
Ain't no love like me and you

I was a clown and the circus were me
You were the theme and I was the tame
You were the one that started the flame
Why can't the love that we had be the same

Grabbing the south-side fairway
Rolling my soul with a bottle of sherry
Oh baby, don't you carry me

Never ... and I made it to Boston
Happy return to your home and lost and
Oh baby, how it's supposed to be

Stuck on the turnpike
It's taking me days to hitch-hike
Ain't no love like me and you

It's taking me days to hitch-hike
Ain't no love like me and you

130,Patti Smith Group,Babelogue,TRJTFEJ128F42933B1,1978,"I haven't fucked much with the past, 
But I've fucked plenty with the future. 
Over the skin of silk are scars 
From the splinters of stations 
And walls I've caressed. 

A stage is like each bolt of wood, 
Like a log of Helen, is my pleasure. 
I would measure the success of a night 
By the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed 
I could exude over the columns that nestled the P.A. 

Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off 
With a skirt of green net sewed over 
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed. 
The lights were violet and white. 
I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it. 

When my hair was cropped, I craved covering, 
But now my hair itself is a veil, 
And the scalp inside is a scalp of 
A crazy and sleepy Comanche 
Lies beneath this netting of the skin. 

I wake up. I am lying peacefully 
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun. 
I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me. 
In heart I am a Moslem; 
In heart I am an American; 
In heart I am Moslem, 
In heart I'm an American artist, 
And I have no guilt. 

I seek pleasure. 
I seek the nerves under your skin. 
The narrow archway; the layers; 
The scroll of ancient lettuce. 

We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly, 
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore. 
He spared the child and spoiled the rod. 
I have not sold myself to God."

And find no place to borne she child, not a single room was in sight
And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

Looking through my window at the dark and troubled sky

And with the gift of charm, they're well endowed.
I love to watch them float right through a crowd.

I used to think it took a giggly girl
To win some fame in this mixed around world.
But I know better now.

One day I met a man who showed me love.
There standing on his head was a snow white dove,
And he said, ""Once I came down to this mire for you,
But I'm the Son of God; He's your Father too.""

It wasn't long before my new walk began.
Since I found Jesus, my life is in His hands.

Now I have life; no one can take it from me,
And I've a home above I'm waiting to see.
There're many rooms in the house of the Lord.
Why don't you come along, and bring someone more?

I used to think it took a giggly girl
To win some fame in this mixed around world.
But I know better now.

Just hit town,
Looking like survivors,
From the Lost and Found.

Brute Force and Ignorance,
Have come to play,
A one-night stand at eight o`clock,
Then they`ll be on their way.

This old town`s exploding,
And the mayor`s uptight,
He`d like to make it to the show,
But he knows it`s not his night.

He`s got to be beholding,
To his legal spouse,
But she`s put the thumbscrews on him,
And snuck out of the house.

There she goes.

The picture on the poster,
Raised an eyebrow or two,
At fifty-five to seven,
Lord, you should`ve seen the queue.

City slick and country hick,
They came one and all,
The traffic-light girl and the downhome kids,
Assembled in the hall.

Brute Force and Ignorance,
Yes, that`s the name,
The young folks gonna miss them,
Now they`ve gone away.

Well, the show got so crazy,
Today they took the billboard down,
I`ll never forget the scene last night,
When the band was escorted out of town.

This little town`s back in slow motion,
I`m sad to say,
After the confusion,
It`ll never be the same.

Well, I took a walk down Main Street,
Just to pass the time,
And I could hear that music,
Still rolling through my mind.

Brute Force and Ignorance,
They sure hit town,
And if you want to find them, buddy,
They`re down at the Lost and Found."

As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you recall when we parted
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill"

Never worked so hard- had so much pain

He was tough, she was wild at fifteen
Quit school and had no dreams
Wasn't going very far
Then he got religion and she got a god
It's on her back and it's in his job
And it costs lots of money, honey- oh, no
Breakdown nearly every day
Shoulda known- couldn't get away
Got lucky with the girl next door
She was lonely and didn't care
She was young, she was dark, she was fair
Wrapped herself around you with her stare
You'd explode if she would touch you there
Touch you there- touch you there

And I learned to love and hate

Better shoot them in the street
Grab a gun before the police come,
Don't tell me you're too sweet
Down in the alley they are hitting harder
Not as blown as a ball can be
They're burnin flags here and just in drag here

Get yourself uptight,	   get uptight

Throw that key down the deepest subway in new york, new york

Ah primal scream I had electric dream
I had to bang my head against the ground
I have to get out quick before I get as sick
As the people living in this town
Bounce me off the pavement bounce me off the wall
Bounce me off a taxi car
Give me a shot of that old jack daniels
And put me down in bars

Just say she ain't mine
&amp; I'll beat you to gelly
it's a hit on the head
with a knock of the knuckles


it's a bucket full of tears
&amp; it's a sea full of rain

goin' down the valley
tryin' to screw Grace Kelly
go for her gelly
she's handlin' mine
sittin' with Sally
ridin' with Smelly
fillin' my belly 
with a bottle of wine"
169,Patti Smith Group,Because The Night,TRKWXST128F428D0ED,1978,"Take me now baby here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turns and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight there are two lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us"

Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see 
What your loving means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday girl

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you, my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday girl

When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I say awake all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
I got the blues, please, please, please come see
What you do to me
I got the blues 

Hurry up
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
Hurry up
Please come see what you do to me"

Come on fade me Jake
I'm a Las Vegas dreamer they took to the cleaners
A bath what a bath what a bath I'd take
A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake
I took that serious

All of my life was a laugh and a joke
And a drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor
Again and again and again and again and again

I'm a gambling fool with a roll and a cue
Wanna play wanna play wanna play with me
Put my ass on the line rubbed my nose in the grime
And they picked me clean
The chance and the game drove Old Silkly insane
What a pain what a strain on my brain it was
A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake
I took that serious

All of my life was a laugh and a joke
A drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me"

Changes come and go we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
All the things we used to say, little things we did each day

Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end

She said, ""There's a halo on that truck, won't you please get it for me?""
I said, ""Of course my little swan, if ever and ever you adore me.""

I can't live at all like this can I baby
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me freezin' on a steelrail truck
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they baby

Grew up in Houston off of wayside drive
Son of a carhop in some old night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath.

I ain't living long like this
Oh, I can't live at all like this can I baby
We know the story how the wheel goes round
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in the jailhouse baby

Can't living long like this, can I baby?

You live for angel she's a roadhouse queen
Make Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
You want to love her but you don't know how
You're at the bottom of the jailhouse now.

Climb on, hold tight, I got a long ride tonight 

Look out, hold on
Don't stop to watch the wheels go 'round
Look out, hold on
I got to cover ground 

Well, I flashed the colors that I wore
I got to have a little more
Of this sweet, sweet thing
I've got a lot of miles to cover
But if you think you need a lover
All right 

Climb on, hold tight, I got a long ride tonight 

Look out, hold on
Don't stop to watch the wheels go 'round
Look out, hold on
I got to cover ground..."
190,Poco,Legend,TRPNFPV128F1456AD6,1978,"Dark as night, cold and lonely,
Rides the horse that's known as only Thunder Road.

Icy fingers hold the reins
While hoofs come poundin' so insanely on and on

Eyes that dance like burnin' embers
All the county still remembers who you are.
Did she love you like they say?
And did she really run away ond leave you here?

Ride the wind


Tonight you'll find her there
No more racin'
With the damp night air

Down the road to Whitman's Crossing,
Underneath the Widow's blossoms soft and green
Covered by the crimson shawl,
Hidden by the leaves that fall down to the ground
Midnight comes and midnight goes,
Inbetween the moonlight shadows veiled in tears."

Jesus Christ was born today

Lo, they did rejoice
Fine and pure of voice
And the wrong shall fail
And the right prevail

Jesus Christ was born today
Jesus Christ was born
Jesus Christ was born today
Jesus Christ was born
And we're gonna get born now"

He said hurry on over and don't be late
He got three lovely ladies who just won't wait

And lookin' for a peace of mind

Now put your Sunday pants on, lets get out on on the road
We been workin' all week, and thinkin' its time we let go
I got three fine mamas sittin all alone, gonna sip my wine and get it on
And do some down south jukin'
Lookin' for a peace of mind

Now come Monday morn we'll be headin' out to the field
And we'll be doin our thing for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill

Inside, a thousand voices talk
And that talk echoes around and around
The windows reverberate, the walls have ears
A thousand saxophone voices talk

You should hear how we syllogize
You should hear about how Babel fell and still echoes away
How we idolize, theorize, syllogize
In the dark, in the heart

Talk, all I hear is
Talk
Hear the sound of the jibberty jungle
In the dark, a thousand insect voices chitter-chatter

The sun goes up, goes over, goes down
I seek sleep, I forget, I sleep

I sleep

Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Feeding it's wanton flame
Come excite the streets with me

It's a long, long way we're coming from
To send this message across, across
Its been hidden, forbidden, concealed, unrevealed
Its got to come out In the open that -

BABYLON IS FALLING
BABYLON IS FALLING

It was foolish to build It on the sand
Handsworth shall stand, firm - like Jah rock
- fighting back
We once beggars are now choosers
No intention to be losers
Striving forward with ambition
And if it takes ammunition
We rebel in Handsworth revolution

Dread town, dread town, dread town,
Dread town, dread town, dread town,

Dread we are for a cause
Deprived of many things
Experienced phoney laws
Hatred Babylon brings
We know what we got to offer
We know what's going on
Don't want no favours
Cause there is still hunger
Innocent convicted
Poor wage, hard labour
Only Babylon prospers
And humble suffer
They are brothers in south of Africa
One Black represent all, all over the world
Can't bear it no longer
Blessed wlththe power
Of Jah Creator
We will get stronger
And we will conquer
And forward ever, and backward never

But [it] isn't everything I thought that it would be,
I while away the lonely hours, gazing at the city towers,
Wondering if there isn't someone in there just for me,

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?

My ambition and wish ?
But I'm missin' the tradition ? that I knew before,
Everybody in a hurry,
No ones got the time and no ones got the time of day.

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,
Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?

One city isn't pretty if you see it on your own,
It's a fabulous place, but the ? isn't fun alone
There's no one I know to cherish, no one I can hug, [nobody around ? day].

Am I ever gonna fall in love in New York City?
Will I ever find a home so far from Tennessee?
Theres no future in the single bars, nothing but the one night stars,

You show me the war but the war 's such a bore.
In the line of duty, in the line of fire
A heartless heart is my proper attire.
The flashing sword has been explored
The perfect slice – perfect slice of life.
I feel the shells hit – Moonlight web
Goodbye arms, so long, head.

Gone is tomorrow.

You can't escape the fate of the chosen one
Black moon rising in a blood red sky

Leaving your body is your answer
That's what you plan to do
Knowing in time you'll cheat death's master
You're on your own going through

When darkness has taken over your mind
And you think you're on your own
Don't believe you are the only one here
Look around, you're not alone

Feel the forces from another world
Ghostly shadows fill your mind
Evil power hanging over you
As extremes are like a tide
Look behind you

Somebody's calling
Someone is near
Feel yourself falling
Crawling with fear

You tell yourself you're dreaming
You realise you're screaming
You know that this shouldn't happen to you
You tell yourself that it just can't be true
But there is nothing you can do, oh

Ghostly shadows from the other world
Evil forces in your mind
Trapped between the walls of life and death
Frozen in the realms of time
Look behind you

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line
Your body is calling, but your senses are blind
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brain
Ice cold fingers, flowing through your veins"

The road leads back to you

223,Eugenio Finardi,Extraterrestre,TRNLWEN128E078C89F,1978,"C'era un tipo che viveva in un abbaino
per avere il cielo sempre vicino
voleva passare sulla vita come un aeroplano
perché a lui non importava niente
di quello che faceva la gente
solo una cosa per lui era importante
e si esercitava continuamente
per sviluppare quel talento latente
che è nascosto tra le pieghe della mente
e la notte sdraiato sul letto, guardando le stelle
dalla finestra nel tetto con un messaggio
voleva prendere contatto, diceva:

""Extraterrestre portami via
voglio una stella che sia tutta mia
extraterrestre vienimi a cercare
voglio un pianeta su cui ricominciare

Una notte il suo messaggio fu ricevuto
ed in un istante é stato trasportato
senza dolore su un pianeta sconosciuto
il cielo un po' più viola del normale
un po' più caldo il sole, ma nell'aria un buon sapore
terra da esplorare, e dopo la terra il mare
un pianeta intero con cui giocare
e lentamente la consapevolezza
mista ad una dolce sicurezza
""l'universo é la mia fortezza!""

""Extraterrestre portami via
voglio una stella che sia tutta mia
extraterrestre vienimi a pigliare
voglio un pianeta su cui ricominciare!""

Ma dopo un po' di tempo la sua sicurezza
comincia a dare segni di incertezza
si sente crescere dentro l'amarezza
perché adesso che il suo scopo é stato realizzato
si sente ancora vuoto
si accorge che in lui niente é cambiato
che le sue paure non se ne sono andate
anzi che semmai sono aumentate
dalla solitudine amplificate
e adesso passa la vita a cercare
ancora di comunicare
con qualcuno che lo possa far tornare, dice:

""Extraterrestre portami via
voglio tornare indietro a casa mia
extraterrestre vienimi a cercare
voglio tornare per ricominciare!
Extraterrestre portami via
voglio tornare indietro a casa mia
extraterrestre non mi abbandonare
voglio tornare per ricominciare!"""

Oh, so I believe my heart, though sometimes it tears me apart

You, you are my life, you're all I am
Baby it's you, you are my life, you're all I am
Only you can understand the way I am

You know I live my life for you

You are my life, you're all I am
Ooh baby it's true, you are my life, you're all I am
Only you can understand the way I am"

Have you seen my Caroline

Well, if you see my Caroline
With her hair of yellow
If you see my Caroline
Tell her I'm doin' fine.

That blows from Corpus Christi
She is to me like the breeze

Fall off trains
Torture dames
Just to keep in the swim
I get slain on memory lane
And the people say ""oh it's him""
Easy money play hard to get
Those love toys to amuse
The non-doctors penthouse pets
Who drink champagne from shoes
Walk in rooms and outta rooms
That's my cup of tea

What's in it for me
Invisible girls go haywire
I'll be their go-go guy
I was a teenage werewolf

Murder victims talk to me
Detectives come and go
Their dangling receivers
Tell me all I need to know
We only live once or do we
Take advice from Mickey Spillane
Me hood Nazi blood brother
Never give the right name
Those dead delicious nudes
They hang around the necks
Moving raincoat
By the sliding doors of discotheques
Where boys are boys girls are toys
Not programmed to reply

To make amends

The cautious talk of a city under suspicion
A perfumed collision...
With the real meaning of a girl

Working in the dark... from the velvet shadows...
In the... black-wood of engines
YOU'RE in suspension...
In the best of all possible worlds

Furnished rooms...
In tune... with the frozen taste of money
A broken television
Flickers in the corner of one eye

A variety show
That goes below......the freezing point of numbers
To understand.....an episode
Of a dream that money can buy

When a necromancer's crucifix....
And fifty dead assistants...
A beer by a dried UP fountain
It's the festival of the spoons: whatever that is

TWO scrumpets dance with rainbow feathers...
On the lines of least resistance...
Into the middle distance...
Of a supermarket tune

Familiar ground....
He stops her breath with the sneak-thief kiss of a roscoe
Love letters from Moscow
Calling for the hard-ware of surprise
In a jealous town...

Where desperation...
Isn't worth the trouble
Meet your double....in an episode...
Of a dream that money can buy

Bye bye love
Say goodnight irene: to the magnetism of the MOMENT
The future fails to feature
Beyond the forcefields of their eyes

Decadant waves: Depraved Danger
Or a plaything of the rodents
Not quite the kind of creature
With whom they socialise"

Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do.

I stole some tunes from the radio.
I lost my nerve but it didn't show.
I found some friends with a little faith.
Less money and no taste.

Now you don't see me, now you do.
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do.

But you've got to work at it.
What a drag.
You've got to work, work, work, work.
You can't lag behind.

I want to get this gig over, and I don't want to see it again.
But I don't want to go until it's over, and I don't want to die in pain.

I know my youth can't last forever.
I'll sing the words until I can't keep the band together no more.

And hunt like a brave man with a flashlight.

Seeking to justify the part you play
And hide, fearing it incomplete
To try to make it any more or less than short and sweet

But short, short is from you to me
As close as we are wont to try to make it be
We're caught watching the dark in the sky
Who knows, helpless as time itself to hold the time of day

And you, you are a fantasy
A view from where you'd like to think the world should see
Be true and you will likely find
A few building a vision new and justice to our time

And we, we, the immoral men
We dare, naked and fearless in the elements
And free, carefree of tempting fate
Aware and holding off the moral nightmare at the gates

And sweet, sweet as a mountain stream
We'll look toward a new day breaking in the east
We'll meet as every future dream unfolds
And surely quality that is the very least"

A whispering on the shore
No clever words you can defend
They lead to never more

Summer nights are colder now
They've taken down the fair

""If I were to marry you, on me 'twould be the blame

If you were born of noble blood and me of low degree
Do you think that I could marry you? It's oh no, not me.""

This pretty fair young maiden she began to look so shy
Her corsets would not meet and her apron would not tie
Made her think on all the times when she said ""oh no not I"".

She wrote a letter to her love to come most speedily
But the answer that he gave to her was ""Oh no, not me.""

Is take your child upon your back and a-begging you may go
And It's when that you get tired you can sit you down to cry
And think on all the times when you said ""Oh no, not I"".

For the leaves they will wither and the root it will die

She will range far south from the harbour mouth
And rejoice with every wave
Who will know the Bluenose in the sun

Feel her bow rise free of Mother Sea
In a sunburst cloud of spray
That stings the cheek while the rigging will speak
Of sea-miles gone away
She is always best under full press
Hard over as she'll lay
And who will know the Bluenose in the sun? (x2)

That proud, fast Queen of the Grand Banks Fleet
Portrayed on every dime
Knew hard work in her time...hard work in every line
The rich men's toys of the Gloucester boys
With their token bit of cod
They snapped their spars and strained to pass her by
But she left them all behind

Now her namesake remains to show what she has been
What every schoolboy remembers and will not come again
To think she's the last of the Grand Banks Schooners
That fed so many men
And who will know the Bluenose in the sun? (x2)

So does she not take wing like a living thing
Child of the moving tide?
See her pass with grace on the water's face
With clean and quiet pride
Our own tall ship of great renown still lifts unto the sky

Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  

The chest of wax  
Flips like a coin  
Into the rhythm  
Into the join  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  

The ladies in  
The comfortable seats  
They look at you with  
Eyes so deep 'cause they're  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  

Well take a bow  
Because you'll get the sack  
I'm pleased to slag you off  
Meat-rack  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  

Strong in maker  
Strong in arm  
Strong with almost perfect charm  
Strong intention  
Strong in strength  
Strong in almost every sense  

Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason  
Strong in reason"
287,Television,Days (Remastered LP Version),TRHDXFE128E078C6E9,1978,"Up on the high, high hills – with my floating friend –
Watchin' all the silver – no one can ever spend
I feel the touch of her hand and all it will erase;
These footprints I followed tho they followed my every pace –
Days, be more than all we have.
No matter how much I cross I always see the same stream.
I'm standing up on these bridges that are standing in a dream."

I ate up all of my humble pie
Paid the dues I owed
Best parts gotta be yet to come
I gotta find out to know
The worst part about you leaving
Is the way I carried on
Cryin' myself to dreamless sleep
But I'm turning the dreams back on

And I'm gonna Rage, past midnight
Taste the midnight wine
If I make to much of loving
My heart breaks all the time
I guess this world keeps turning
I guess this life goes on
If we all stay Spunky
We're gonna carry on, yeah
Gonna carry on

289,Black Sabbath,Over To You,TRABVMZ12903CD1EBA,1978,"Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison
You called a school

Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

Travelling endlessly, I'm searching my mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
'Cause what can I do?

Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding your children
Keeping your laws

Someday you'll suffer
Then what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises
Over to you

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
The future looks blue
What can I do?

Tears filled of sadness
Sealed in myself
Whispering secrets
What do they tell?

Mad politicians
Can't tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you"
290,Wishbone Ash,Bad Weather Blues,TRNEDZA128F1459BA3,1978,"Well, I been away,
I said I been away for so long.
Tell me, have you,
Have you done me wrong?
Can I tell by the look that's in your eyes,
Have you kept your loving locked away inside?
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -
Take away these bad weather blues? 
I done time, I got carried away,
I done laid this high-class babe out in the hay,
Spent half a year in the jailhouse all alone -
This never would have happened if I'd stayed at home, oh no.
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -
Take away these bad weather blues? 

Come on everybody, then, clap your hands in the air.
Come on, a little bit louder, a little bit louder,
Come on everybody. I'll teach you, come on,
We want to hear you. Louder, louder!
We want you all to join in with us -
When we say ""Yeah"", when we say ""Yeah"",
We want you to say ""Yeah"". You got it?
Come on, are you ready? Can't hear you!
That's better, here we go.


Say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Can you shake the dust, can you shake the dust,
Can you make me shine?
Can you shake the dust and make me shine
Like they do in Sheffield all the time? 

Been everywhere around the world,
Seen every, every kind of girl, yeah.
But it moves me the way that I think I know,
And it weakens me, so make your loving flow.
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -
Take away these bad weather blues? 

Can you shake the dust from off my shoes -
Take away these bad weather blues."

Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, baby
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, child
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Every place that I go
Well, it seems so strange
Without you love, baby, baby
Things have changed

Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine
From the city hall
To the county line, that's why

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Now listen
Every place that I go
Well, it seems so strange
Without you love, baby, baby
Things have changed

Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine
From the city hall
Woman, to the county line, an' that's why

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
There ain't no love in the heart of town
There ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around, woman, woman

Was this what our elders taught?
Dim the lights and live like story book.
I can't focus for the pinball.
I'm all shook up and I think I see it all.
But I know that it ain't that simple.

I got loose.
Up on the roof.
Waiting for you.

Two-faced,
Was this was out elders taught?
We're human too,
indulge in small talk.
I take a walk down the alley.
Some drunk half-kills me.
We're fighting on the floor for a ha'penny

I got loose.
Up on the roof.
Waiting for you.

Well, I guess I'm waiting for the punchline.
I'm a refugee with a rare find.
I've got a place where I can unwind.

I got loose.
Up on the roof.
Waiting for you.
We'll hide"
293,The Stranglers,Toiler On The Sea,TRPPXSM128F4259C0C,1978,"I had a woman ship 
I took her overseas 
She left her hold unlocked 
I had to find a dock 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 

We didn't use cruel words 
To navigate cruel seas 
The wind was biting hard 
At times I had to scream 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 

And when we reached the land 
We went aground on the rocks 
Became a wreck in the sand 
Became a home for a flock 
We ventured overland 
Fought with the aliens 
The young ones used their hands 
Pointed the way to a flock 
A flock of seagulls! 
A flock of seagulls! 

Then we retraced our steps 
Rebuilt the woman ship 
I took her back up north 
I lost her in the fog 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler on the sea 
I was a toiler 
I was a toiler 
I was a toiler 
On the sea 
On the sea 
I was a toiler 
I was a toiler 
On the sea 
I was a toiler

From the album TAKIN' IT EASY (1978). 

Ain't no sorrow for that woman. Ain't no pity for this fool.
She wrote her name upon my window, signed it ""Gone, with love, Midnight Blue.""

There's a story goin' 'round here, 'bout a woman dressed in black.
Spendin' money and drinkin' whiskey, drivin' 'round in my big black Cadillac.
There's a shanty down by the river. They say she went there to meet a friend.
They found his body beneath the willows. She signed it ""Gone, with love, Midnight Blue.""

There's a jailhouse down in this county, with its windows oh so high.
They're gonna hang me come Monday morning, write my soul, Midnight Blue, across the sky.
Now if I ever get to heaven, I'll look St. Peter in the eye.
And say don't you ever let that woman ever appear. 
She's Satan's daughter, in shades of midnight blue."

From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here

Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around"

Well, here it is the late 1970's going on 1985. Y'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed electronic disco, we never get a chance to hear master blues men practicing their craft anymore. By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public library. So tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, while we still can, let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois, the blues men of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, The Blues Brothers!"""

Hi there Lili Marlene
Good morning school girls
Welcome to the team

Beehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house arrest

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but oooh they feel so warm

Flying to my hometown on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle trying to see what I could see
She leaned over and said coffee tea or me
White apron and brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Broke my left leg and sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform Women in uniform
Women in uniform Women in uniform

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a sten gun
Baby I surrender let's have some fun

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform Women in uniform
Women in uniform Women in uniform

Khaki navy blue and brass buttons bring me to my knees
A peaked cap and a badge or two oooh they're such a tease
So girls if the man you need just won't come across
Put on a uniform show him who's the boss

Women in uniform sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform but ooh they feel so warm
Women in uniform khaki white and blue
Women in uniform coming after you

And what you like is all right with me
But when the drummer hollers, give him some
No use, you've got to turn it loose

Relax you till you let it out wholehearted
