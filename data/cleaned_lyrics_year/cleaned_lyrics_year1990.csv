0,Alma Cogan,Dreamboat,TRQLKEZ128F1462F14,1990,"You dreamboats, you lovable dreamboats
The kisses you gave me set my dreams afloat
I would sail the seven seas with you
Even if you told me to go and paddle my own canoe

Sincerely, I love you so dearly
I'd follow you darling to any shore
You dreamboats you lovable dreamboats
Say that you'll be mine for ever more

You dreamboats, you lovable dreamboats
The kisses you gave me set my dreams afloat
I would sail the seven seas with you
Even if you told me to go and paddle my own canoe

Sincerely, I love you so dearly
I'd follow you darling to any shore
You dreamboat you lovable dreamboat
Say that you'll be mine for ever more"
1,Anthrax,Got The Time,TRTNDRN128F4257E87,1990,"Wake up, got another day to get
Through now, got another man to see
Gotta call him on the telephone, way-o
Gotta find a piece of paper

Sit down, got another letter to write
Think hard, gotta get a letter just right
Little ringing on the telephone, woah no
Gotta write another letter

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head

If I tell you what I'm doing today
Will you shut up and get out of my way?
Someone asked me what the time is, I don't know
Only know I gotta go now

No time, tryin' to get a watch repaired
No time, never got a thing to wear
Little ringing on the telephone, woah no
Hear a ringing in my head now

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head 
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head"
2,Obituary,Body Bag (Reissue) (Album Version),TRLTOOR128F423BA73,1990,"You're rising
Cure you of the dead
You're dying
Live beyond the way
Falling thru the gates
Scavenge you
With the darkening light
Thru the falling going low
Thru the death of those
The dying ...
We're dying
Healing of the one
Falling of the days
Charring in the sun
We're dying
Killing for the need
Violence of the ways
Slowly bleed
Killing for the need
Rising of the dead
The falling ways
The killing for the need
.. darkened light
The rising of the dead
With the darkening light"
3,The Chills,Heavenly Pop Hit,TRIPOOY128F92EDD20,1990,"Each evening the sun sets in five billion places
Seen by ten billion eyes set in five billion faces
Then they close in a daze and wait for the dawning
But the daylight and sunrise
Are brighter in our eyes
Where night cannot devour golden solar power

Once we were dammned, now I guess we are angels
For we passed though the dark and avoided the dangers
Then I awoke with a start to startling changes
All the tension is ended
The sentance suspended
And darkenss now sparkles and gleams

And it all seems larger than life to me
I find it rather hard rather hard to believe

So I stand as the sound goes straight through my body
I'm so bloated up, happy, and I throw things around me
And I'm growing in stages, and have been for ages
Just singing and floating and free

Dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
If anyone wants it
Dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
It's something that we're humming as 
We swoop low on trees, or we sweep under carpets
We can dive into suns, though it's not recommended
We can hover, silent, and listen, closely...

It all seems (all seems)
Larger than life to me
I find it (find it)
Hard to believe

So where was our home
Well, our home was in tears
For its fruit has gone bad
They'd been that way for years
Yet their lives are elastic
They should be fantastic
They should be expanding

Dum de dum dum
Dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
If anyone wants it

Dum de dum dum
Dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
For anybody
For those that still want it"
4,Les VRP,Sidney,TROHJLL128F428BFA5,1990,"Déjà tout petit il aimait smurfer
Et c'est pour ca qu'on l'a nommé Sydney
Sur le pick-up de sa grand-mère
Il faisait du scratch sur Yvette Horner

De la salle a manger jusqu'à la kitchenette
Il faisait la navette en tournant sur la tête
Et pour aller de la chambre au salon
Il se déplaçait toujours a reculons

Pour sauver leurs disques, ses parents lui achètent
Pour son anniversaire, un magnétocassette
Mais bien vite il trouve une solution
Il se l'met sur l'épaule et fout le volume à fond

Fond, fond, fond les petites marionnettes
Ainsi font font font trois petits tours
Et puis s'en vont

Finalement ses parents craquèrent
Et du troisième étage ils le jetèrent
Il s'éclata en bas, tout désarticulé
Mais c'est ce qui lui fallait pour encore mieux smurfer"
5,Paul Anka,(All Of A Sudden) My Heart Sings,TRGVWJK128F930102A,1990,"The secret way you hold my hand
to let me know you understand
the wind and rain upon your face
the breathless world of your embrace
your little laugh and handsome cries
the star light gleaming in your eyes
remembering all those little things
all of a sudden my heart sings

All of a sudden my heart sings
when I remember little things
the way you dance and hold me tight
the way you kiss and say good night
the crazy things we say and do
the fun it is to be with you
the magic thrill that's in your touch
oh darling I love you so much

The secret way you hold my hand
to let me know you understand
the wind and rain upon your face
the breathless world of your embrace
your little laugh and handsome cries
the star light gleaming in your eyes
remembering all those things
all of a sudden my heart sings"
6,Exhorder,The Tragic Period (Album Version),TRPXGWA128F4238DD0,1990,"Here's a tale in history
About a period of tragedy 
A man who thought of horrid things
But really sought what happiness brings 
Terror instilled within the souls
Of men and women, young and old 
Come and listen to me, my friend 
He'll make your morale descend 

One Boston day, it's sad to say
A newborn child was granted miserable life 
Abandoned by his father and
Left alone by death of father's wife 

Foster child 
Tobacco exporter gave him a chance 
History defiled 
Twisted by literature, dark and opium enhanced 
Irregularity 
So far ahead of his time 
A spark of a breed
Regarding all of his literature creed 

Infamy of tales and poetry 
Connecting his themes to his wildest dreams 

The maelstrom grew but no one knew 
He descended far beyond its spinning walls 
Into the pit, the black abyss 
His house was collapsing as he searched for El Dorado 

Perched upon Pallas was life, hard and callous
The shadows of burden lifted nevermore 
The vulture eye of death concealed
By wooden planks below the floor 
The quest for solace evolved into sorrow 
Lingering obsessions 
Intoxication, stimulation, creation 
Hindering addictions 

Apparently the message in a bottle was lost
For I could see no conclusion 
But all of us remaining in the shrouded past
Must remember to further ourselves by obtrusion 

Inebriated grin leads the mighty pen
Across the paper as his fears come alive 
Satiric whim ignites the brim
Of insanity as Pluto arrives 
Swaying cognac barriers
And the beating of his hideous heart
Increasing ever so constantly 
Conjuring the ne'er forgotten lore 
'Tis only this and nothing more 
Nevermore 

Lightning bolts
Tearing through his house and soul 
Mental gibes 
Darkness hailed in what he's told

Eternally infatuated with despair 

Fortunado leads the way to fermented pleasures 
But as the cup of drink is met
The hour tolls and the Red Death guest reveals 

In a kingdom by the sea
Is where they left beloved thee 
The time has come to join, my dear
In your kingdom by the sea

Hear the toll of the iron bells!"
7,Steve Wynn,Kerosene Man,TRLQAUH128F4242B8E,1990,"Once I was down in the promised land
In a borrowed tent with a caravan
The leader of the pack stuck out his hand
He said, ""Pleased to meet you
I'm the Kerosene Man""

And I jump and run and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Three day bender with Ray Milland
Scotch and soda and candied yams
Things they were getting out of hand
Ray was dancing with the Kerosene Man

And I jump and run and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Me and Mickey Mantle and Stan the Man
Were talking about a kid we couldn't understan
He batted .360 in Birmingham
Got fooled by a curveball by the Kerosene Man

And I jump and run and steal the show
wher it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man

Chinese food in Alabama
I was looking at the menu, according to plan
Ate too much moo goo gai pan
Had one more dream about hte Kerosene Man

And I run and jump and steal the show
Where it's heading I don't know
When these things get out of hand
Look out baby, it's the Kerosene Man"
8,Element Of Crime,Nervous And Blue,TRIHRSB128F9307EDA,1990,"I'm out on the street, I stroll about town, and I don't know why
I find myself watching the ducks in this lake, and I don't know why
I don't wanna see you, I'm not in the mood, and I don't wanna talk to you either
I ain't got no food for the ducks and I ain't got no idea what to do

I'm just feeling so nervous and blue

Out of a snackbar, filled up with coffee, and worries 'bout me and you
I didn't expect them fighting in this very street
I'm suddenly mixed up with trouble I suddenly find myself down on my knees,
warm blood running down over my face and I wonder if a whisky would do

I'm just feeling so nervous and blue

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you so
Whatever I do, I beg you to keep that in mind
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I can't be all yours all the time,
but don't you ever, don't you ever think I was hiding from you
I'm just feeling so nervous and blue
I'm feeling so nervous and blue"
9,Lloyd Cole,No Blue Skies,TRUKXZG128F429D8FC,1990,"You want to leave me, baby, be my guest 
All I'm going to do is cry 
And then I'm gonna find me someone else 
And tear the stars out of the sky

Looking for something when there's nothing there to be found 
Make it easy on yourself 
Go out and find your body someone else 
Or tear the stars out of the sky 

Baby you're too well read 
Baby you're too well spoken 
Baby you're too pristine 
When I cry, do you feel anything? 
Baby you're too well read 

You want to leave me, baby, be my guest 
All I'm going to do is cry 
And then I'm gonna find me someone else 
And tear the stars out of the sky

Baby you're too well read 
Baby you're too well spoken 
Baby you're far too clean
When I cry, do you feel anything? 
Baby you're too well read 

You don't need me anymore 
You don't need me anymore 
They say storms are rife for summertime 
Well baby, I'm long gone 
What are you going to do when you open your eyes 
It's a brand new day and baby 
No blue skies?"
10,Slayer,War Ensemble,TRQUYSJ128F92EA2E3,1990,"Propaganda death ensemble burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night in blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy, the reason for the siege
The pendulum exchange the blade, the strafing air blood raid

Infiltration push reserves encircle the front lines
Supreme art of strategy playing on the minds
Bombard till submission, take all to their graves
Indication of triumph, the numbers that are dead

Sport the war
War support

The sport is war, total war
When victory's really massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Sport the war
War support

The sport is war, total war
When victory's really survival
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Be dead, be from above when darkness falls
Descend into my sights, your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines, flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition forward their ground

Regime prophetic age old in its time
Flowing veins run on through deep in the Rhine
Center of the web, all battles scored
What is our war crimes era forever more

War

Propaganda war ensemble burial to be
Bones shining by the night in blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination, twisted psychology
When victory is to survive and death is defeat

Sport the war
War support

The sport is war, total war
When the end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill"
11,Mojo Nixon,Ain't High Falutin',TRBHXJF128F428F966,1990,"I ain't got no tuxedo
I don't know what fork to hold
She asked me to a dance
Where they wear fancy pants
Don't like me the way I am
Go suck some spam

Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

Her dad hates me at the front door
'Cause I blew my nose on the floor
I ask him how it be
Down at the sock factory
He said, ""Boy, what's that smell?""
I said, ""Muscatel!""

Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

The sign on the door says there's a dress code
The band sounds like Depechy Mode
Let's get out of here
Get ourselves a beer
Wanna be unzippin'
Let's go skinny-dippin'

Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

I said I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't high falutin'
I said I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't high falutin'"
12,Exhorder,Desecrator (Album Version),TRCSAXB128F4238DCD,1990,"My religion is myself
Desecration's my belief
Your misfortune's my enjoyment
And I thrive on your disease
I don't care about your feelings
Pain and torment's what you'll get
I'll rape your heart of love
And I'll make you eat my shit

I'll piss on your grave
Total desecration
I spit in your face
For no apparent reason
I'm sick and depraved
Society's garbage of what I'm made
Devoted to hatred
Unholy war and violent ways

Virgin Mary's cursed to hell
Who needs her anyway?
The Pope is slaughtered in the street
Catholics grieving at his feet
Painting of satanic stars
Desecrating church's walls
I have no rules, I have no mercy
No remorse, I feel no pity, life is death to me
The desecrator

Agnostic beliefs
Defecate before the holy world's maternity
Origin of the species, strongest shall survive
Blitzkrieg tactics upon your family life
I need no reason, there's no cause
All I need is victims to exercise my hateful laws

My pleasure is your pain, your grievance is my gain
Desecration's my greatest pleasure in life
Your children will be my sacrifice
Offspring slaughtered, lacerate your spouse
My itch is scratched, I feel relieved
That I brought your fucking world down to its' knees

Fuck your God
No regard for your religion
Pacifist
No need to pray for my forgiveness
Exhorted coitus
Beg me to release your life
Slaughtered child
How could your lord allow him to die?

Placid world once alive
Dig your grave and jump inside
Never trust, never love
Dig your grave it's just as such
You weakened hearts are torn to shreds
A lying beast now has your head
Kill, rape, hurt, steal
No living time to heal
Desecrated, desecrated, desecrated, desecrated, die!!"

14,Bruce Hornsby and the Range,Carry The Water,TRFFWJK128F9314629,1990,"Some live life with eyes that don't see
They look away at the time of your greatest need
Some talk, some'll just do, some turn their back
Turn around and just walk away, I know I've done that
Lonely days and lonely nights
Easy to be cynical never put yourself on the line
I'd like to reach out well why don't I
Take the load up off your back, I'd like to try

Let me carry your water
Let me carry the weight
I will bear your burden
Let me carry the load

Working hard, sweating all day in the long hot sun
Feel alone with the heavy load you're not the only one
Bossman says time to jump, we say how high
If you need a hand getting off your feet baby I'll try

I want to cover you like the sea on the sand
Easy to be cynical never take a stand
Easy for me not to give a damn
I'll ask you to call for me and I'll give you a hand

Let me carry your water
Let me carry the load
I will shoulder your burden
Let me carry the load

Lonely nights and lonely days
You wait for someone to come along and sweep you away
I'll put myself out there it just might feel good
I don't always do that, but I think I should"

In the short time that I have got to know you
I have found here a wrong way to go about it
It's just this fear, the fear I have to go about you

You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl

16,Percy Mayfield,Louisiana,TRSDROW128F4278157,1990,"I was born in Louisiana, I was raised in Algiers
And everywhere I been, the peoples all say
Ain't nothing in rambling either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down

I first left home, I stopped in Tennessee
The peoples all begging, ""Come and stay with me""
'Cause ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down

I was walking through the alley with my hand in my coat
The police start to shoot me, thought it was something I stole
You know it ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down

The peoples on the highway is walking and crying
Some is starving, some is dying
You know it ain't nothing in rambling, either running around
Well, I believe I'll marry, oooo, wooo, Lord, and settle down

You may go to Hollywood and try to get on the screen
But I'm gonna stay right here and eat these old charity beans

Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we made up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here..."

You've really got a nerve
And all you wanna do is flirt
Love is just a word
That you tell to all your birds

Does it give you any satisfaction
To see the worst of one's reaction
And this has never happened
It's my first love attraction

And what did I do to deserve this?
Some days I feel all nervous
Please use the telephone service
I hope today you hear this (Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Gee, it's great after bein' out late
Walkin' my baby back home
Arm in arm over meadow and farm
Walkin' my baby back home

We go 'long harmonizing a song
Or I'm recitin' a poem
Owls go by and they give me the eye
Walkin' my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again
Walkin' my baby back home

She's 'fraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Hand in hand to a barbecue stand
Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again
Walkin' my baby
Talkin' my baby
Lovin' my baby
I don't mean maybe
Walkin' my baby back home"

Somebody just can't get enough
Your picture's hanging in my car
I love you for just who you are

And don't you know I want you?, maybe
Baby

Get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me
Put it in a letter
If that'll make it better
And send it to me, haa
Stick it in a bottle
It's always getting hotter
And send it to me, haa
Nothing gonna stop it
So shoot it like a rocket
And send it to me

I sit behind a desk all day
And dream of you to get away
I got no money in the bank
I don't need much, got you to thank

And don't you know I want you?, maybe
Baby

Oh, get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me, ah
Put it in a letter
If that'll make it better
And send it to me, haa
Stick it in a bottle
It's always getting hotter
Send it to me, haa
Nothing gonna stop it
So shoot it like a rocket
And send it to me, ahh

Deep in the night, I turn around
And wish you were here with me
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy
Can't you see
That you're the one that I love?

Get your motor running
Can't you hear me coming?
And send it to me, ooh, oh, oh
Stick it in a bottle
Ain't nothing gonna stop it

23,King's X,I Can't Help It (LP Version),TRPJLLR12903CA0893,1990,"A feeling welling up inside that seems to grip my soul
A neverending need as far back as my mind can go

But I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I can't help it

A gate flies open wide, a momentary river flow
Then back to scrutinizing watch to see the water slow

But I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I can't help it

But I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I just can't help it
I can't help it

So then a mark is left a feeling of some type of relief
And then the laughter comes reinforcing my belief

I just can't help it

You're the one in my heart
You're my darlin'

You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you
And I always will

Well I've had some sweethearts
And dear, so have you
I know that I've done things
That I shouldn't do
We've both tasted life
Both the bitter and the sweet
It helped us to know love
When we chanced to meet

Oh you are the one
You're the one in my heart
You're my darlin'
My life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you
And I always will

We paid for our future with tears from the past
It helped us to know when we'd
Found love at last
I didn't know what joy was
Still actin' blue
I didn't know what love was till I met you

26,N.W.A.,100 Miles And Runnin',TRKZZDH128F1497388,1990,"Intro: 

And why do we call ourself 'Niggaz 4 Life'. 
'Cause if we die we still gon' be some dead niggas. 

""You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?"" 
""We haven't spotted them yet."" 
""But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity."" 

[MC Ren] 
A 100 Miles and Runnin'. 
MC Ren, I hold the gun and 
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in. 
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct - 
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck. 
Chances are usually not good 
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood. 
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who. 
When in a black and white the capacity is two. 
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. 
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers. 
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past. 
Point blank - They can kizz my black azz. 
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police"". 
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace. 
Now it's broken and can't be fixed. 
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so 
Now I'm creepin' through the fall. 
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all. 
So for now pack the gun and 
Hold it in the air. 
'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'... 

""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run."" 
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"" 
""100 miles to their homebase, Compton."" 

[Eazy E] 
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear. 
So I can tell you why... 

[Dr. Dre] 
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase. 
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced. 
The road ahead goes on and on. 
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon. 
Runnin' on but never runnin' out. 
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out. 
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. 
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude. 
Confused... 
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. 
One of the few who's been accused and abused 
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. 
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes. 
And Dre is back from the C-P-T. 
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E. 
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E! 
And any mutherfucker that disagrees. 
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past. 
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. 
Now the FBI's all over my dick. 

[Eazy E] 
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. 
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block. 
A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch. 
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch. 
Yeah, back to Compton again. 
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen. 
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time. 
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind. 
Runnin' like I just don't care. 
Compton's 50 miles but , yo, I'mma get there. 
Archin' my back and on a straight rough. 
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out. 
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by. 
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm 
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin' 
Straight at yo ass. 
A 100 Miles and Runnin'... 

Interlude: 

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton. 
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you: 
""Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide."" 
Good luck brothers. 

[MC Ren] 
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose. 
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused. 
I know it was a set-up. 
So now I'm gonna get up. 
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up. 
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong. 
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song. 
And while they treat my group like dirt, 
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts. 
So I'mma run til I can't run no more. 
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score. 
I got a urge to kick down doors. 
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls. 

[Dr. Dre] 
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'. 
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'. 
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it. 
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it. 
The number's even - now I'm leavin'. 
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in. 
Her and the troops are right behind me. 
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me. 

[Eazy E] 
One more mile to go through the dark streets. 
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet. 
But you know I never stumble or lag last. 
I'm almost home so I better haul ass. 
Tearin' up everything in sight. 
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight. 
Now that chase, the shit, is done and 
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with 
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!

Deep inside the mystery

Whose empty life is but a shell
Empty hearts will echo
Forever in the wishing well

You've got to help me find an end to the nightmare
'Cause I can't stand this pain and the curse of time
Somewhere in your eyes I'll find the answer
Give me the truth I've been looking for
Be my guiding light, I'll take my chances
Turn the card, seal my fate, close the door

Some days come with a vengeance
Some days I feel so bad
The mirror holds no secrets
I lost the best thing that I had

Fortuneteller
Can you help me to see, is there an end to the sorrow
Or was this slow ride to nowhere always meant to be
Somewhere in your eyes I'll find the answer
Give me the truth I've been looking for
Be my guiding light, I'll take my chances
Turn the card, seal my fate, close the door

But we were both to blame somehow
In the heat of the moment I told her to leave
I guess I lost more than I found

Might just seem like one more good time
But down some dead end streets there ain't no turnin' back
Angel dust
Children I know it's hard to listen but
Angel dust
I ain't tryin' to run your life
Angel dust
Don't mean nobody no good nowhere
And down some dead end streets there ain't no turnin' back
Please children would you listen to me
I'm not tryin' to run your life"
37,Ricky Van Shelton,I Meant Every Word He Said,TRIGPIL128F4262EFD,1990,"I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
And without you, he'd rather be dead
I felt my hands shaking
I felt my heart breaking
'Cause I meant every word he said

I saw him whisper something
Then I saw you look so happy
It's a look I won't ever forget
'Cause whatever he told you
Meant I'd never hold you
And I meant every word he said

His heart stole those words from my head
Now, it's too late to tell you what he's already said

I heard him say: I love you
I heard him say: Forever
Then he said: With this ring, I thee wed
And when he said: I do
I choked back: I do, too
And I meant every word he said

Crying on your shoulder, I'm crying for nothing

Running nowhere, I'm running from you
Looking back, I'm not looking back
Melting near you, I'm melting for you
Showing me inside, your showing me inside

Clear white insides
Translucent skin
Your eyes are burning
Breaking in two

Ma pusti nek' traje, jos je daleko svitanje
Nisam ni prvi ni zadnji mozda tek nesto drazi
Ne pretvaraj se
 
Ja sam samo jedan u nizu
Neznas mi ni broj
Ja sam samo dok sam ti blizu
Tad sam tvoj, samo tvoj
 
Al' sutra, sutra je novi dan

Pusti sad to

Mozda bas ja, tko to sada zna?

The skies foresee the fearless rage of war
Their heads held high the knights await
For the sun to shed its light upon the moor

Wipe the sleep from out your eyes
The sun begins to climb the sky today
Ten thousand men will fight
For king and god and all that's right today

The Hammerhead has thrust his sword
The strife is o'er, the battle won again
And now his bloody work is done
The women rush to greet their lord and men

Wipe the sleep from out your eyes
The sun begins to climb the skies today
Ten thousand men have fought
For Hammerhead that noble lord today"
41,Marc Almond,The Gambler,TRQWBDS128F1462A7F,1990,"On a dark night in a lost hour
In a town built from neon and chrome
Where Las Vegas seeks the desert
In an old broken down casino
There the gambler slapped his money down
Dirty dollars one hundred or more
Placed his last bet on a poker game
Crossed his heart for the winning score

But the players at the table
Two men of the phantom creed
Seemed to play with sombre purpose
Than a reason and pure greed
And the gambler felt his back freeze
And fear brushed his ageing brow
For he'd seen those men before in his dreams
Here they sat before him now

And the one smoothed back his black hair
With a comb slicked by brylcream and grease
Flipped the cards with a flippancy
Of a wily and slippery ease
With his sharp suit shade of lilac
On a shuffle he made the cards sing
Gold studs and menthol cigarettes
Rubies set in a skull ring

And the other of the clergy
With a colour and robe of pale ivory
Silver grey at the temples
And a smile that was stern and was kindly

Jack of hearts lead, wait for aces
Became faces of family and friends
Until the deck showed him a picture
Of his life from beginning to end
Reverend Life he flipped an ace
And the gambler felt blood in his heart
For he knew this was the game of games
He would need all the Reverend's heart

Anger, lust and gluttony
The gambler seems hit hard
Each failure and each feature
Mapped out in the slippery cards
Greasy Mr.D. flashed a winning grin
And stood facing Reverend Life
The Reverend paled as he saw the score
The gambler felt pain as a knife

His troubles, tribulations 
Revelations and regrets
A wife, a child, a fight to trial 
Turned by the hand of death
And the gambler saw his hand stained 
With the blood of his family ties
And with the yellow smile of Mr.D. 
In his mind he crumples and dies

And these two great men from different worlds
Faced each other and shook of hands
The reverend shrugged ""ah well next time""
And departed for heaven's land

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb

And the flames leapt and the soul screamed
And the cards scattered round the room
And life is always a gamble
A game from the cradle to tomb"

I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two walking the floor over you

You left me and you went away you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone

'Cause no one else could love you better

Just me, just you

Until the 6 becomes 9

Even if it takes 100 lifetimes

Could never wear us down, can't tear us down

Just us, just us, just us two

There's a fine line between sensuality and the spirit, baby
And you and I will find a way to bring those two things together
Magically, harmonizing, everlasting love
Until the 6 becomes 9, I'll be loving you"

57,The Northern Pikes,Unimportant,TRJVWJX128F1458891,1990,"Pop and youth it’s always walked toward me
It’s come to my side I guess I’ll see it go by
If I should remain

Age has always been a big deal seems rather natural to me
You’re born you live a life you die a cry when you enter
Weeping when you go 

Unimportant, so, so, unimportant

We’re all the same there is no difference color, religion or sex
Man’s indifference is our hindrance from what all that began
Does it all end up in a coffin or an urn, a vessel for the  

Unimportant, so unimportant

Oh just wait until you’re dead and we’ll see just how big you were 
You weren’t no Columbus, Rembrandt or a Mozart and you thought

You were such big stuff, HUH!
Who are you 
You’re unimportant, so unimportant
Who are you"

We got some poison in us
Cyanide and nicotine
More than you've ever seen
More than I can believe
Woe, woe, woe, woe

Guns guns they all got guns
Now they wanna shoot someone
I'd rather be drunk than dead
Or go where Jesus fled
So I'll get drunk again
Or maybe not
Woe, woe, woe, woe

I saw on a tombstone
He came in this world alone
Spent all his time alone
He left this life alone
Woe, woe, woe, woe"
59,Maxi Priest,Close To You,TREDBDB128F14584E2,1990,"She was a jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' me 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream (dream)
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holding me the way you do
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh)
And show you the way I feel (huh huh huh)

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back or she too far
Windin' me up just to let her down
So emotional, gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the full moon rising, I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh huh huh)
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Every time your body's next to mine
Something deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She got an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in frame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on the countdown till I get heard

Her blood was hot, she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you (huh huh huh huh)

Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear

Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at

Am I guessing wrong about your feelings?
Is it all a fantasy, that I think you wanna be?

Can I talk eternal and will you know what I meant

Squash is defied, make up your mind

But she'd rather have sugar!

Like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapons in our hands
We crashed the gates so hard we'd never heard that kind of sound before
And braced ourselves for victory and the spoils of the land
Defences melt away before our frozen blank surprise
From the palace now we stare into a million waiting eyes
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall, the heads I've hunted down the hall
And I guard my winnings well, carry them with me when I fall
Now the daylight hours pass like the people I have lost
In the triumph of the hour, in the bloody cause - lust for power

Like a vision she dances through the shafts of light
Everything I've ever dreamed about focused true and bright
And fortune opens up the ground, blackens out the sky
I kissed her once, I kissed her twice but I couldn't remember why
When I was young they taught me well to always play to win
But they never said what happens when you've won the bloody game
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall. . .

And all desire is satisfied but still the hunt goes on
It's funny how this feeling stays with all the reasons gone

We've seen them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame
I've run for home and words gone by but nothing seems the same
I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass
From the other my reflection and I don't know which is worse
The streets are lined with glittering stores and a million fatted calves
I can catch myself sometimes these days and all I do is laugh, laugh
Ch: I've got my trophies on the wall . . ."

You know my love belongs to you

78,Chemlab,I Still Bleed,TRNRELZ128F421E51D,1990,"Legs bent and twisted up underneath me
Limbs like wood my blood flows like pitch
My body shudders and curls against your jaw
Blackened and burned in need of
A stitch or two

You sewed me up and pulled me apart
You sewed me up and pulled me to bits

Your disease comes sinking into me
Its teeth all chiseled mercilessly
Hammering my nerves until I'm split and severed
But somehow you don't see

I still bleed
I hear the razor call and I bleed
Everytime we touch
I still bleed

Down the long grinding night
A cigarette burns a slow hole into my split lip
My eyes burn out 'cause I see too much 
I touch your mouth cold skin your hips 
Kiss the wound where
I still bleed

Lying just South of your Mouth
Acid burns in every kiss
Loaded breach and swallowed barrel 
I never thought it might come to this

Try to hold myself shut together
Stapled sutured but everytime we touch
Then I still bleed"

Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown

I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

In the cool of evening
While the insects buzz
In the tattered screening

Lonely as a Lover
Waiting for the night to fall

Oh the sky is blue

And I couldn't get much higher
And you make my day
When you turn to say
That I set your heart on fire

Fecund desire
Burning like a fire
Feel the purple passion pull
Mellow as the moonshine
Sparkle like a new wine
Baby you just got it all

Senses overloading
Drowning in a pool of love
Sweet temptation
Never gonna get enough

Oh the sky is blue
When I think of you
And I couldn't get much higher
And you make my day
When you turn to say
That I set your heart on fire

Sharp as a blade-
Blasted high with danger
Flexing intense
With the muscle of love

And I couldn't get much higher
And you make my day
When you turn to say
That I set your heart on fire

Oh the sky is blue
When I think of you
And I couldn't get much higher
And you make my day
When you turn to say
That I set your heart on fire

Sex beat, big time
Pumping up the love line
Clear cut straight to the nerve
Pleasures untold
Silver and gold
Everything that we deserve

Drowning in a pool of love
Sweet temptation
Never gonna get enough

Show me the jukebox, I'll tell you a song you should play
Sooner a later a few shots of bourbon
And I'll think of somethin to say
Bhoa, I can take her or leave her
But I like to take her away

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain
I never knew two women who acted the same
Some want a drink first
And some want to just sit and talk
Whoa, oh, it's two in the morning
I'm running and she wants to walk

Something's got a hold on me
It's cheap but it ain' free
Love or somethin like it's got a hold on me

That's when I asked her
My place or your place
I hope I'm not out of line
I asked the wrong thing
But just the right woman this time
Cause she knew a hotel
She even had a name we could sign
Whoa, oh, the cheaper the grapes are
The sweeter the taste of the wine

85,The Northern Pikes,She Ain't Pretty,TRVEXVG128F145888C,1990,"I had two jobs, I had dishwater hands
And on the weekend in a rock and roll band
One Friday night, in my hometown bar
In walked a girl who looked like a movie star
She stared at me and it was turning me on
She said she worked in a beauty salon
I heard a voice inside me say
She ain't pretty, she just looks that way

We made a date to go for a drink
I wore my jeans and she wore a mink
There was this misconception all over town
That she ate lonely guy heart by the pound
She said, ""Take me home, there won't be no fuss""
I said, ""Sure, you got some change for the bus?""
Watching her leave, I heard the bartender say
She ain't pretty she just looks that way

So, uh, I called her up, her father was home
Said, ""She's busy, she can't come to the phone""
I held my breath and decided to wait
A guy like me doesn't get many dates
I fell in love with a model from hell
It took some time for my hormones to tell
That chasing her has been a grave mistake
She ain't pretty she just looks that way

Her ego wrote cheques incredibly fast
But her personality didn't have the cash
I laughed out loud to my total dismay
She ain't pretty she just looks that way

She ain't pretty she just looks that way
She ain't pretty
She ain't pretty
She ain't pretty

I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really in my heart.
There's only so much that words can say
So I sent you a piece of this beautiful day.
Oh
I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you.
Took some flowers in the spring
made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you.
Took a song from the lark - the moon from the dark

A spark with the sparkling dew.
VVith a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you.
I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss

It's the kind of letter that you can't resist.
Oh
I want you to know that I took a rainbow . . .

In a day or two - just you wait and see

You're gonna get a special delivery.
You'll know the way I feel -
There can't be any doubt
When you open it up
And let the love spill out.

Oh
I want you to know
That I took a rainbow . . .
You know
I sent 'em off
In a letter to you.
You know
I sent 'em off
In a letter to you. . . ."

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

I know something about love, you gotta show it
And make him see that moon above
Reach out and get it

And if you want him to, only think of you

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now


Ever since the world began, it's been that way for man
And woman were created
To make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so, complicated? Oh yeah

I know something about love
You gotta take it and
Show him what the world is made of
One kiss will prove it
If you want him to be
Always by your side

Dragging sinners

Bitch :    You like that?
Homeboy :  Put 'em off
Bitch :    It's good?
Homeboy :  Ouch, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn, shit I said suck the
mothaf**ka, you're bitin' it, shit!
Narrator : Has this ever happend to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and buy
N.W.A.'s new book entitled ""The art of sucking dick"".
Bitch :    Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick, next you gently lick it up
and down, then insert it into the mouth. Take it slow, don't rush
it, and before you know it ..
SPLASH!

Eazy E :

It goes one for the treble, two for the bass, She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...

Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho'
Cought on the late night, Stampin' on the base-pipe
She's a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started givin' up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather
Every time I asked her what's the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she would'nt even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me
'cause she's got a gang o' kidz knuckle-heads and all dirty
And she's givin' pimp by a nigga that's 30
I saw her hangin' in the alley
Raggin' to her friends how she's ho'in' in de valley
All by herself, doin' on the whole strole
Commin' back home late night with the bankrob
You know a bitch like that makes me sick,
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick

Chorus :
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]

At a high school dance -
Me and the niggaz bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, With the clan,
So sexy, thought she was all that
She would'nt even look it up because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walkin' home from school saw her suckin' a nigga'z dick, another bleacher
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut could'nt escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw her
There was'nt a nigga on the block
Late at night not gettin' done


So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course 'cause my dick you it's harder than a telepole
Then again it don't concern me
'cause there's a slight chance if I f**k she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot de ho'
I mean checkin' with de quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from gettin' sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick

Chorus :
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]

Now I was at a club on a late late sunday
Peepin' at the bitches 'till the next day monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I locked her
She was at the end of the bar gettin' f**ked up
Back at the house she was bitch n' be ignorin'                          
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda borin'
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she's dancin' on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shakin' that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she's with it
Oh and when she turned sobber should'nt have had admit it
So while she's dropped I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick ..

Chorus :
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Lick de big dick, baby, I wanna f**k this one
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it                          
""So there you have it - a job well done, but for now let me get back to what
I was doing""
She swallowed it .. She swallowed it ..
Get it all baby, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy
suck this diiiiiick
oh, she swallowed it .. get it all, suck this dick for daddy ..

Hey mothaf**k, I want you to suck Dre's dick,
Then I want you to suck Yella dick
You already sucked Ren's dick ..

YOU BOYZ ARE DISGUSTING!
Just suck my dick bitch"

Where meek souls will receive Him still

I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it

My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two days and a half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high
I pulled over to ask, were we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
""El Segundo,"" he said, ""my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto""
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor
Ali said, ""Damn, Tip, what you drive so far for?""

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)

Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said, ""Pay for lunch"", so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked 
Beautiful lady she was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed:
""Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step 
But, what do you know, my wallet I forget

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man

Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound
Jettin' on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""All right, Tip, see you tomorrow""
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack
Of Shaheed, ""We gotta go back"" 
When he said ""Why?"" I said, ""We gotta go
'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""

Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
Left my wallet in El Segundo
I gotta get it, I got-got ta get it

97,Hawkwind,Wings,TRZRDVX128F932AA3A,1990,"I could see their dying note
In the sky that is so old
I remember where they once flew
Where they sang to the morning dew
Now their wings are soaked in oil
Caged wings that can't unfurl
No longer do we hear them sing
No longer do we hear the fluttering
Of wings
Underneath the iron bird
Their song cannot be heard
Above the human sound
Above the poisoned ground"

Waiting for my end

Save me

But I know my time has come

Do they know what they have done?

Save me
If you save me you'll save yourself
Why don't you understand?

Save me
Your fate will be sealed
If you destroy me
You will live in a wasteland

My life is your life
And your life is mine
We belong together
Since the beginning of all time

If I were a man
I know what I would think:
""Life is a chain
we're all its links!""

Save me. Save me, save me
Save me. Save me, save me
Save me. Save me, save me
Save me. Save me, save me

Wars and pain and misery
I've survived - I still exist
I have lived through your history
And watched you through the mist

Screwed to the floor
I'm high on the shock
I've closed off the door

Cut to the heart of pain
Loaded with dice and shame
Where do you stop?
Why do you stop?
You'll just do the same again

Give me a crime
I'll show you the love
A song to the lonely
A song from above

Wailing from wall to wall
Lucid as a doll
Kick down the legs
Bite on the tongue
You'll just do the same again

I'm screwed to the floor

I've closed off the door

I knew her eyes were watching me
So I ventured further in my mind
In the hope that I would find

Tangerine trees and
Marmalade skies and
Plasticine porters with
Looking glass ties

My mind had formed a mental prison
I cried aloud no one would listen
Then floating through the heavy mist
My vision took a sudden twist

Tangerine trees and
Marmalade skies and
Plasticine porters with
Looking glass ties

Empty people stood in grey
Children laughing far away
An empty courtyard wept alone
Rain lashed down on darkened stone
An empty courtyard wept alone
Rain lashed down on darkened stone

Tangerine trees and
Marmalade skies and
Plasticine porters with
Looking glass ties

Marmalade skies and

A threshold I had crossed before
On turning back all I could see
Were her footprints on the sea"

Piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling,
Unburied corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment,
Torso's torn in two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue,
Butchered for human stew

Crawl into the cadaver head first,
Eat your way through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards
Is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck up vomit through intestines
Leaving nothing but bones

Violently cutting, seriously hacking,
Sounds of death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets,
Blood spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head,
Smearing remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking,
Sounds of death fill the air

Blistering flesh, another death,
Stiffened bones, morbid groans
Evil minds, brains oozing slime,
Feel the pain

Body weak brain contorting,
Fluid flowing from your organs
Veins torn out, Mangled

Festering flesh, quivering cadaver,
Ligaments stretched around your own neck
Drink the puss, Mangled

Severed dick, bloody bowels,
The gutted corpse now lies hollow
Feeding on feces, Mangled

Amputated arms, crushong legs,
Head is ripped right off your shoulders
Thrown in a pile, Mangled

Limbs rearranged, head on backwards
A humongous heep of twisted flesh
Sewn together, Mangled - Mangled

His knife plunges in, your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds he cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood

His knife plunges in, your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds he cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood

Menacing madman mutilating
Destroying disfiguring, dead you'll be
Crushing cracking killing you
Annihilation, desecration

Born through modern day science
Man has made his last mistake
A creature so hideously horrible
Leaving nothing to waste

Evil has a new face,
A mangled horrible face
His views are those of death,
Nothing will stop his lust

Slicing victims left to decay,
Listening to their mortal cries
Unhuman, immortal, beastial,
Now he owns your soul

Suck the vomit through intestines
Leaving nothing but bones

Human converted to beast,
The perfect killing machine
Psychotic structure of brain tissue,
Murder his only memory
Dependant on death, crushing your head,
I'm addicted to blood, chew the decay

The weakened man must die,
Tearing out his insides
Smashing all the bones,
Hear his tormenting groans"

Go over, and see Miss Stella Gold

The gals from the alley, slipping all around
Telling everybody, they're leaving town

I got a yellow gal, and a brown named Mame
But the best I've ever had, was the old Crow Jane

Met a funny fellow, he didn't like girls
Painted his face, and with his hair all curls

I'm staying with a woman, about fifty‑two
I thought she was too old, I'm telling you"
104,LL Cool J,Around The Way Girl,TRESHWD128F146B9F9,1990,"(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)

Verse 1
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

Verse 2
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Oooh you love me) come around my way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)

Verse 3
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renée, I love you (smooch)
You're from around the way

CHORUS
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around-the-way girl, an around-the-way girl
Fine as can be
(Oooh you love me)
She oh, yea
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me (the only one for me)

On a hot wind ocean
And the summer comes and the summer goes 
And always has and will
And something, somewhere that you said 
Goes ricochet all through my head
And flashing like a neon sign, the time stood still

Hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away
Today, today, today
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days

And still the whining of the wheels
Is closest to the way I feel 
And winter comes and winter goes
And always has and will
Another hour, another day
Another year you pissed away
Remember walking in the rain
I'm walking there still

That’s hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away
Today, today, today
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days

Like every heart to beat before
And every wave to kiss a shore
I'm not the first, I'm not the last
And soon to be your past
But every morning 
When the light comes
Creeping in around my eyes
Another future falls behind
The one I had in mind

It’s hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away

Looking over the crowd
The reunion band playing too loud
And he sees his fellow old star
Looks him up and down
Sees a little of himself in his frown

The stander on the mountain
Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some
About the old days
King of the mountain
Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
When he was the one
And the stander on the mountain runs

Let us sit and talk of old times
That's what we're supposed to do
And you don't look a day over thirty-two
Yes we were so funny and wild
There's an old friend of mine
Says I'm looking back most all the time

And the stander on the mountain
Listens to the sound of the city streets, the lonely heat
The town he once owned
King of the mountain
Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
When he was the one
And the stander on the mountain runs
King of the hill runs away

Oh she's knocking on your door tonight
Oh she wants to see if she remembers right
Say won't you come outside tonight
Alright
They drive to the lookout on the hill

And when it was over
They sat there and looked back
Tomorrow was way in the distance
Tomorrow was a long time away
Nobody thought much about it
And there's nothing wrong if we live for today

I recall when you filled it on up
And you bowed to the crowd
The girls in the short skirts screaming loud

The stander on the mountain
Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some
About the old days
Big man around town
Nothing could be found of the old ways, the old days
When he was the one

I don't want your money
I don't want you, honey
I never wanted your number
I never wanted your name
I don't need affection
I don't need protection
I never wanted nothin' from you
And that's the name of the gameso

Repeat chorus"
116,Doro,Alive,TRNXKPE128F4213BD0,1990,"All alone, and night is falling
All along, I hear you calling
Telling lies, and sad goodbyes
The secrets will be safe inside of me

As long as I'm alive
You'll always be a part of me
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive
For you I'll always keep
The fire burning inside

CHORUS

I will keep this love alive
Let our souls be the first me satisfy
I will keep this love alive
Oh let our hearts be the only guide we follow

Everybody knows, you can't build a wall around us
I believe time will tell
Our hearts will stay forever locked together

As long as I'm alive
For you I'll always keep
The fire burning inside

CHORUS"
117,Wasted Youth,Ethiopian Nightmare (Album Version),TRPYOPT128F147C3CC,1990,"I remember everything
I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
I was barely seventeen

And I once killed a boy with a Fender guitar
I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it had a heart of chrome
And a voice like a horny angel

I don't remember if it was a telecaster or a stradacaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy
It required the perfect combination of the right power chords
And the precise angle from which to strike

The guitar bled for about a week afterward
And the blood was so dark and rich, like wild berries
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterward but it rung out beautifully

And I was able to play notes
That I had never even heard before
So I took my guitar
And I smashed it against the wall

I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley Davidson

The Harley howled in pain
The guitar howled in heat
And I ran up the stairs to my parents' bedroom
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight

Slowly I opened the door, creeping in the shadows
Right up to the foot of their bed, I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar
Crashing down upon the center of the bed

My father woke up, screaming, ""Stop
Wait a minute, stop it boy
What do you think you're doin'?
That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""

And I said, ""God dammit Daddy
You know I love you
But you got a hell of a lot to learn about Rock 'n Roll""
I remember everything"
118,Chapterhouse,Lady Godiva's Operation,TRUOAFX128F935DD80,1990,"Lady Godiva, dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly-haired boy
Just another toy
Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
Saying words that have oh so clearly been said
So long ago

Draperies wrapped gently 'round her shoulder
Life has made her that much bolder now
That she found out how

Dressed in silk, satin, lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny-fare
Pretty passing care
Hair today now dripped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
Isn't it fun?

Now today, propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
And hasn't a care
""Doctor is coming,"" the nurse thinks sweetly
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air
The body lies bare
Shaved and hairless, what once was screaming
Now lies silent and almost sleeping
The brain must have got away
Strapped securely to the white table
Ether causes the body to wither and writhe
Underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with a knife and baggage
Sees the throat, of oh so much cabbage
That must now be cut away
Now comes the moment of great decision
Doctor's making his first incision
One goes here
One goes there

""The ether's leaking,"" says someone who's sloppy
The patient, it seems, is not so well sleeping
Screams echo up the hall
Don't panic, someone give him pentathol instantly
Doctor removes his blade cagily slow from the brain
By nine out of ten
The head won't move"

My heart's not ruled by greed.
I don't love a diamond.
Diamond's you see through.
I want you to hold me.
I want you to be true.

Give me the gift of love.
Look me in the eyes.
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.
That'd be the best surprise.
Give me the gift of your sweet love
in the light of the day,
in the dark of night.

Like the colors of the sun,
the feelings in your heart.
It's all I want from you.
And when the sky is dark
I'll have you beside me.
Who could ask for more?
I'll just wear a smile
when you walk in the door.

Give me the gift of love.
Look me in the eyes.
Say I'm the one you're dreamin' of.

120,Daniel Lavoie,Chanson de la terre,TRYAPZG128F92FC5F2,1990,"Y a que les corbeaux dans les champs aujourd'hui.
Le travail des hommes attend la pluie.
La terre est noire, brune, blonde ou rousse.

Y a que les corbeaux dans les champs aujourd'hui.
Que revienne l'eau au fond des puits.
La terre est chaude et le blé y pousse.

{Refrain:}
C'est la terre austère, c'est la terre de nos pères.
C'est la terre qui nous fait vivre.
Terre noire, terre claire, terre trempée, terre séchée, terre creusée,
Terre usée qui rien ne livre,
Terre joyeuse au mois de juillet.

Y a que les corbeaux dans les champs aujourd'hui
Mais un ciel d'orage annonce la pluie.
La terre est bonne, sous nos pieds si douce.
Y a que les corbeaux dans les champs aujourd'hui
Mais demain, les blés seront en épis.
La terre se donne et l'enfant grandit.

122,Wayne Newton,Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast,TRZVJHD128F9312B0E,1990,"The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway when I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

Now, it broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run to catch a train
She had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good
I turned around and there she was again
As she said to me

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

If only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again
She cried and said

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Oh, daddy, don't you walk so fast

The discomfort in your seat

There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free

All love's luxuries
Are here for you and me

And when our worlds, they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

una nueva cancion que hable de ellos
de la gente que uno quiere
de la gente que uno quiere
de la gente que uno quiere
No puedo ver esos muchachos
en la derrota
parados en el medio de la vida
sin saber que hacer.

Yo quiero que juntemos nuestras fuerzas
y mueran los miedos
creciendo para arriba sin veneno
como crece el maiz

As we start trudgin, me and my brothers we be lookin and be buggin
Vehicles of life they be rollin and be mergin
Searchin for the virgins of life
that be shovin out the door that's crack
The valleys of time, are always on my feet
As least the beat will combine
The calluses and corns with the funky bassline
You don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
Well can I get a level on the bass and on the treble
Footin up and down like a UNLV Rebel
The answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics
Can't be too much flackin, not too much packin
You must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
Your feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact
The rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
This ain't rock 'n' roll cos the rap is in control
If you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car
I'd rather go barefootin, for prints I will be puttin
all over the earth if we can get there first
Now that we are in it, footprints are bein printed
So fi you recognise em, you can try to size em
They'll probably be the ones with the size not fryin
all over reveal, you won't have to yield
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield

(Q-Tip)
You can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
But we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block
Hand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade
It's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
It's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
The mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
Catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
You will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
See the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin
A Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preachin
the point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
The loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star
We are bulgin, I'm indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat
Explanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat
Keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep
But dig it in the ground because the foot print now

(Q-Tip)
If there's a storm that's brewin, it won't keep us from doin
our thing as we start swingin, travellin is bringin
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome
A chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
Because my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town
Rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
When you get your finger on the music it'll linger
Sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
A Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that
Remember me, the brother who said ""Black is black""
You can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress
Get emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best
Makin moves, makin motions, flowin like an ocean
The walkin will continue, we know that we will bring you
the times that you have waited, more anticipated
Be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong"

The muscles flex the mother's ring
She fastens children to her king
and sends him down the crooked street
When he returns, the birth's complete

Jimmy holds the Tannis root
The forest's tasty nectar shoot
The sun tips off the monarch's suit
from sequined sash to shiny boot

Like Icarus, who had to pay

Thought about takin' a brand-new stand
The name of the man is Jesse Jackson
And his call for peace was loud as action
Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't ever stop
Brothers stand together and let the whole world see
Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history

So vote

Hypocrites just talkin' trash
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Liberty and justice are a thing of the past
(Let's talk about Jesse)
They want a stronger nation at any cost
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Even if it means that everything will soon be lost
(His name is Jesse)


So for fast and friendly service hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
And there's no need to be nervous hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
He's changin' our conditions hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
So join the Rainbow Coalition hey
Come on

In command of temptation

Or a summer that will go
Where's salvation

How you hunger for illusion

Take more than you own

You'll be standing in the rain
You'll be crying out in shame

One, two, three, four

When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school
His mind would turn unto the waters
Always the focus of adolescent ridicule
He has no time for farmers' daughters
Alienated from the clique society
A lonely boy finds peace in fishing
His mother says ""John, this is not the way life's supposed to be"" 
""Don't you see the life that you miss?"" 

And he says...

When I grow up, I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think, before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman

Now years gone by, we find the man who rules the sea
He sets out on a dark May morning
To bring his catch back to this small community
He doesn't see the danger dawning
Four hours up, oh the ocean swelled and swelled
The fog rolled in, it started raining
""The starboard bow! Oh my God we're going down!""
They do not hear his frantic mayday

And he says...

When I grow up, I want to be
One of the harvesters of the sea
I think, before my days are done
I want to be a fisherman
""I'll live and die a fisherman""

Calling John the Fisherman...

Still I'd look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think of myself

I'd find a way to leave the past behind

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly

Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance! Go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony

Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon

Burning 'em if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo

Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say, ""hi,""
Did you stop? No, I just drove by

Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead, yo
So, I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue

Girls were hot, wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard were shells

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack

Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene, just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground

'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this

Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Made your body sticky with some bumble bee honey
And tickled your fancy with my finger or a feather?

Laugh at me

Everytime that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick all the nonsense desease
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet 
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand I know some mafiosos
Quick to pull out cuetes on some stupid ass baboso
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa

In wheels of no return
And dreams that fade along the way
Never to grow old, and change
Shades of long memories
The times that I've been on my knees
I try to believe in somethin'
But i call out to no one

You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
Gor a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years

In this world of heartless desires
I try to understand
The church of new love's waiting
To take us by the hand
Just believe, believe in somethin'
No matter if it's love or money
'Cause whatever gets you through your life
Is alright, it's alright by me

You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
For a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years

'Til the skies come falling down
'Til the walls come crumbling down
I'll wait, wait for you

You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
For a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years

Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
May have nestled its way into his mighty throat
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down
The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator
Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did

She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days
The sight was beyond belief
Many a head snapped double - even triple - takes as this vivacious
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway,
Where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out

They hung in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be
Found in one place
And that was O'Malley's Alley

The air was thick with cat calls, no pun intended
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch
As she sauntered straight into the heart of the alleyway
She knew what she wanted
She was lookin' for that stud bull; she was looking for that he cat
And that was me

Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee

Say baby do you wanna lay down with me?
Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side?
Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me?

And then, he said,
""Hey Snappy, me and Greeny'll come along -

But only if we can bring a friend.""
""His name is Harold.""
I said ""Okay.""

Now, we had a
Swamper, Greeny, Wendy O, Stanley,
Harold of the Rocks and me.
We hopped into my dart
And headed for the nightbreak
To see a man they call Schooly D.

Harold he's a friendly guy.
He rambles on and on.
He'll talk the balls off a rhinosaurus.
Fact is, he just doesn't make much sense.

""Well"", Stan said.
""This guy's pretty bizarre, Gus.""

Harold of the Rocks.

I saw Harold at a party
Trouzy threw late one night.
I said, ""hey man,
Do you remember me?""
He said, ""O' course
I do Snapdad and
Let me tell ya right
'Bout now I'm lit
Up like an ol' Christmas tree.""

Hey bro you know I'd
Like to thank you once again for lettin' me
Hang with ya' all across the bay.
When I look back at that night I get me a
Warm spot across my heart.""
Then he shook my hand, and walked away.
That's the last I seen of Harold.

Harold of the Rocks.

So in the end,
Swamper and Greeny
Finally succumb to
The ways of Harold.
And in doing so
Each gave just a little bit
Of his soul away.
What a couple of dumb shits."

Girl, I know you're out for the money
Flesh for gold, diamond and fur
We've seen you workin' on every guy in this town
Trading your voodoo for the bible of who's who

All of your dreams you're searching for gold
I'm not too blind to see your kind

You were baptized by fire, painted by rain
You're under the spell, feeling no shame
Baptized by fire - to you it's a game
You were baptized by fire

From out of the trash to burning desire
Still this pouring rain in your heart
Will keep you spinning in the same direction
Can't you feel it ripping your world apart

All of your dreams you're searching for gold
I'm not to blind to see

(repeat chorus)

It's a sign of the times how people 
Mess with your mind
One day they say they love you 
Then they leave you behind
It ain't you they want
It's you they haunt
And the weaker they make you 
The deeper they take you
Down til you don't know what you feel  
What do you feel?
Well, I know your game, it's nothing new, so
You can say good-bye to me cause I have 
Said good-bye to you

Voodoo Child Voodoo Child
Voodoo Voodoo Voodoo Voodoo Child
Time to take my freedom, time to take control
Baby, cause I'm on a roll, hit it!"

Con tante rose sulla gonna
Che si nasconde coi capelli
Due labbra rosse di coralli.
Chi avrà nel cuore mia sorella
Che questa sera è così bella
Qualcuno ha messo già una spina
Dentro quel mondo di bambina.
Chi avrà nel cuore quella sposa
Che aspetta non sa più che cosa
Forse un bambino forse un uomo
Venuto a chiederle perdono
Che tenga strette le sue mani
Perché sia bello il suo domani

Chi avrà nel cuore la bambina
Che sogna sopra una panchina
Forse una vita a cinque stelle
O solo pattini a rotelle.
Chi avrà nel cuore la signora
Che non ha più fissa dimora
La gente non ha più rispetto
Per quell'insolito suo letto
Qualcuno scaldi le sue mani
Che sia diverso il suo domani

Chi avrà nel cuore quella madre
Con un bambino da cullare
I sogni ancora nel cassetto
E troppo spazio dentro al letto.
E quella piccola gitana
Bella e stregata dalla luna
Innamorata della vita
Che balla e non è mai sfinita.
Chi avrà nel cuore quella donna
Che a casa forse più non torna
Coi segni ancora sulla pelle
Di quella notte senza stelle
Qualcuno sciolga le sue mani
Che anche per lei ci sia un domani

Chi avrò nel cuore questa sera
Ho il senso di una vita intera
Che si racconta con gli sguardi
Che non ha voglia di ricordi.
Abbiamo tutte un'illusione
Qualche rimpianto una passione
Un giorno da dimenticare la voglia di ricominciare.
Se sfiori ancora le mie mani
Io ti regalo il mio domani."

Once again with a new blend, so telephone a friend

and we never have the money for the flight
i'm in the back seat sleepy from the travel
we played our hearts out all night long in new orleans
and i'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black
when the first breath of texas comes in clean
and there's something bout the southland in the springtime
where the waters flow with confidence and reason

it won't ever be too long
till i'm home again to spend my favorite season
when god made me born a yankee he was teasin'
there's no place like home and none more pleasin'
than the southland in the springtime

in georgia nights are softer than a whisper
beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand
with the farmland like a tapestry
passed down through generations
and the peach trees stitched across the land
there'll be cider up near helen off the roadside
and boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
and the smoke from the chimneys meets its maker in the sky
with a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers
and there's something bout the southland in the springtime

173,Living Colour,Someone Like You,TRXZNET128F4263533,1990,"Do you remember
The time of laughter
Children playing, life was so sweet
Before our city forgot us
And let the druglord take our street
Pacify me politician
Pacify me with your lies
Blind to the people suffering
Deaf to the children's cries

But I know what to do
With someone like you

Police
They chased my brother
Policeman licensed to kill
Oh how I miss my brother
Good shoes are so hard to fill
Policeman are you happy?
You snuffed a medical student out
Maybe he could have changed the world
I guess we'll never find out

But I know what to do
With someone like you
I know what to do 
With someone like you

It's never too late to change your ways
It's never too late to change your ways

Too young
Gave her body
She was afraid of being alone
One baby having another
Sweet baby wants to be grown
But there's an angel on your shoulder
Always speaking to your soul
Listen and your heart will be glad
You'll never have to be alone

'Cause I know what to do
With someone like you
I know what to do
With someone like you

I know what to do 
With someone like you

I know what to do"

Put it all together baby and you got
Lots of groovy loving, Lover by the dozen
Giving you things like diamond rings
What they wouldn't do for you
At its best there's still the emptiness

Really got it going on

Snap your fingers and they all come running
But what about your love baby
Snap your fingers and they all come running
What are you thinking of baby

There you go up and down, in and out
What's another casual fling in the life of a groovy lover,
Underneath the covers
You hold on tighter still, to the thrill
What you wouldn't do for this
In your eyes you're so desensitzed
Traveling down the road alone
Really got it going on

Do you really have it all together,
I don't think so baby
I don't think that passion lasts forever, no no no

A big old house with lots of loot
Fancy cars with compact discs
And plenty of lips to kiss
You got leather and polished satin
You got that umpth, you're what's happening
You walk that walk, and talk that talk

Will a child find me by a stream? 
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream.

For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn

Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power

Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born"

With a way that we both feel is drivin' us insane yeah

You silly old man 
You're making a fool of yourself 
So get off the stage 

You silly old man 
In your misguided trousers 
With your mascara and your Fender guitar 
And you think you can arouse us?

But the song that you just sang 
It sounds exactly like the last one 
And the next one 
I bet you it will sound 
Like this one 

Downstage, and offstage 
Don't you feel all run in?
And do you wonder when they will take it away?
This is your final fling 

But then applause ran high 
But for the patience of the ones behind you 
As a verse drags on like a month drags on 
It's very short, but it seems very long 

And the song that you just sang 
It sounds exactly like the last one 
And the next one 
I bet you it will sound 
Like this one 

So, get off the stage 
Oh, get off the stage 
And when we get down off of the stage 
Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY!

Get off the stage 
Oh, get off the stage 
And when we've had our money back 
Then I'd like your back in plaster 

Oh, I know that you say 
How age has no meaning 
Oh, but here is your audience now 
And they're screaming: 

""Get off the stage""
Oh, get off the stage 
Because I've given you enough of my time 
And the money that wasn't even mine 
Have you seen yourself recently?

Oh, get off the stage 
Oh, get off the stage

For whom, oh... 
For whom, oh... 
For whom, oh...

Get off the stage

And every way I turn

And words that mean nothing
Are endlessly rushing
Telling me nothing I really wanna learn

A million lonely people in a hurry
Sharin' nothin' but a burden of worry
They're goin' nowhere at all
They're runnin' at a crawl
And of all the faces near to me
Only one ever speaks to me
And that's the face of the clock on the wall

You've got to run so hard
Just to stay where you are
You've got to work
You've got to earn
You've got to spend
The more you have, the more you want

Everytime I tell them, I'm so glad you're mine

Down by the riverside, down by the riverside

Strike up the band, start the parade 
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade 
Just play that drum, play that number 
When the saints come marchin' in

Shake tambourines, play that cornet 
Crank up that horn you won't forget
Your heart will hum to that number 
When the saints come marchin' in

The cymbals clang, just pound that beat 
Sounds like a hundred marching feet 
It's fun to join in that number

See banners wave, oh hear that ring

Cussed your name
You're just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who'd steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Flora Grey, the gossip of Madison County died with child
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

Reuben James, with your mind on my soul
And a Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the field
Unto your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me, and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me.

The dreams I dream, only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless scheme, only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care

And you'll recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be the one time
A hopeless little dream like that comes true

The fantasy is mine
it's you I long to find

I close my eyes
and dream that you are here tonight
make believe you're crazy for me

You turn your head to hide
I know the reason why
the moon we ride
could drown the swelling tide
I call out from the shore
a siren from the sand
this lonely land I am forever more

Blasphemy to idols made in stone
Throne of might and its unseen Lord
Stars waned by the fright of Him

Shining jewels in his crown
like drops of my sacrificial blood
Ceremony of the abhorrent's deaths
Words too insane to tell

Chaos...

The pentagramic rule
Of the frigid existence
Disdainful temptation
Of an absurd resistance

Mindless decaying eyes of the dead
Observe the world with fear
Staring at the growth
Of limitless domination

Dementious, perverse lust and will
To see my Master as triumphant
Extreme of my coldful force
To bring His enemies down on knees

Cruel, unresponsible wisdom
Purity of duration in fear
Chaotic experiences of my mind
Becoming now to be distinct

And when I think I've won the fight
The monster comes back again

You can hear the desperation of a sad and broken heart

I've been wounded by folklore

y alcohol desayunó miss Onassis,
pobre Cristina,
que al fin logró quedarse en el chasis.
Sólo yo sé que dice la pura verdad
cuando jura que toda su fortuna daría
por echarse un noviete aburrido y formal
por entrar de oficiala en una peluquería.

con que la piropea
un albañil.

si le puede conseguir
pastillas para dormir.

Corazón tierno,
los dueños del verano la miman,
pero el invierno
no se lo saca nunca de encima,
con su cara de dólar
ha amortizado varios maridos,
pero siempre está sola
poniéndole una vela a cupido.
De la isla de Scorpios en yate a New York,
del gran baile de Mónaco a cenar en Maxim's,
guardaespaldas armados la sacan del Rolls,
un amante alquilado le calienta la suite.

Cris, Cris, Cristina
dirige una oficina
tumbada en la piscina
de Incosol.

empapadita de sudor
no se quita el albornoz.

las flechas del amor le disparan,
solo el espejo
le escupe la verdad a la cara.
Nadie le advierte
que al cielo no se va en limusina,
que mala suerte
que no acepte la muerte propinas.

que la niña mimada de los ojos de Ari.

But I wake up alone

Without you

I don't wanna dream tonight without you

What will I do
(Pray to god my soul won't break)
I don't wanna dream tonight

As I lie here in the darkness
And I try to struggle free
From these chains of depseration
That's all you've left for me
All through the night
Your face, fills my dreams
Once more I fall, like before
Then the sun comes up
And I'm alone again
And the heartbreak beings

So long to the memories
When loneliness was my only friend
Sometimes it's hard when you close the door
To look back for more, and find it's
Not in your heart

So I close my eyes
And I start to dream
I'm not alone

They will not be the last

These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

You see, I just can't understand
Why I keep making this same kind of mistake
Over and over again
But there's one question that remains in the back of my mind now
And that is
When will I see you smile again

Tell me when will I see you smile again (Maybe we can talk it over)
'Cause I know I messed up, baby (Maybe we can work it out)
And I know you're fed up, sugar

They ain't still ready to fight but i've had the world
at my feet
And i know it's right

Feel the kiss of twisted metal
Like a drink running hot in my veins
I've got a score to settle

They're calling me back
So i'm turning my head to the wheel

I'm thirsty for more
So i'm sending my foot to the floor

Looks nobody's buying
Looks to me you can't go home again
So i'm riding alone
maybe the lights are on - but nobody's home

So long to my brothers
Later on once again you're left behind
Are you lashed to the mast
Or will you drown in the chair
Where i found you last ?

I wann feel the wind in my face
And the velvet shimmering limousines
Like a kiss from the queen of the damned
Like the smell of gasoline

'Til the day they fold his arms across his chest

He's a long way from the cradle

And his Ma's authority

But it only seems a minute

Since he stood over his bed

And she tried to tell him something

Now what the hell was it she said ???

Jesse James is thinking of the breaks he never had

And the gene that cursed his blood group rhesus-bad

Jesse James lived money

His account was in the black

'Til the day he stopped a bullet with his back

Well the zip cose may read Vegas

But the heart beats Tupelo

And a footstep is such a small thing

That it's neither here nor there

'Til you string those steps together

And find home is way back, way back where ?

Jesse James was never

Part of lifes great symphony

All he heard were penny whistles out of key

Jesse James he promised :

""I will never die afraid""

That boy perjured every vow he ever made"

mai una povera illusione un pensiero banale qualcosa che rimane
invece per me, più che normale
che un'emozione da poco mi faccia stare male
una parola detta piano basta già ed io non vedo più la realtà
non vedo più a che punto sta
la netta differenza fra il più cieco amore
e la più stupida pazienza no, io non vedo più la realtà
nè quanta tenerezza ti da la mia incoerenza

Where did our love go
Boy, don't you even care?

Ready to fall in love

I wonder if you ever loved me
Tell me, was I so blind that I could not see
holding on to the memories

Was someone to call my own

You'll never know
We'll never know

Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well, we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you're long gone
You left me and the river here all alone

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the hall
And washed your picture right off the wall

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

Well, my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
If you change your mind honey I'll be here 
Waiting on the banks of that ole Dog River

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you 
I got the Dog River blues

I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you

Where shadows throw shadows on the wall
And memories are mountains to climb
Knowing everyone can fall

And here where the cobwebs count the hours
Since we let the laughter clear the air
Painfully trying to touch
Knowing that we used to care

Separate houses separate hearts
It's hard to face the feelings tearing us apart
And in this house of broken dreams love lies

Can we keep our castles in the air
While we're keeping both feet on the ground?
'Cos if your heart can touch another heart
Love can turn it all around

Get rid of those empty glances and empty sighs
Or tears of longing will fill your eyes
In this house of broken dreams love hides"

Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was gonna go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets
'Cause I'm never gonna come back home

Saturday night and the moon is out

When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet

When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

They got a alligator stew and a crawfish pie
A Gulf storm blowin' into town tonight
Livin on the delta's quite a show

They got hurricane parties every time it blows
And here up north it's a cold cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today
Except when the paper says: Beausoleil is coming into town
Baby, let's go down

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat
When it lifts me up I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor
When I hear that fiddle wanna beg for more
Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

Bring your mama, bring your papa, bring your sister too
They got lots of music and lots of room
When they play you a waltz from 1910
You gonna feel a little bit young again
Well you learned to dance with your rock'n'roll
You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-so-do
When you hear a little Jolie Blon

Saturday night and the moon is out
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout
Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat

Never seeing from behind my eyes

By the real meaning in our lives

Wanting to taste the cold, clear river
Wanting to swim for the rest of time
Never giving to beggars on the corner

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""

My shoes were high and I had scored
I bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end

You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

Se potesse bastare partorire parole,
dedicare preghiere, seminare le viole
Dondolare sul filo per sfidare il destino
Intrecciare ghirlande per deviare il cammino
Ma nei giorni dal vero dove tutto è diverso
Perché il sogno si infrange quando l'uomo ha già perso
Il mio canto di vita sembra un pianto leggero
Ed un fiore che nasce resta solo un pensiero
Tra le statue di sale e i deserti di lava cerco segni di vita
Dove il mondo pulsava cerco fiochi respiri e brandelli d'amore
Cerco semi sepolti che germoglino al sole."

t'es la femme de ma vie

t'as l'air d'un ange
c'est un signe du ciel, il est temps que j'me range
oui c'est pour moi que Dieu t'as envoyé ici
merci seigneur, merci

à ton sourire j'ai su que t'avais rien d'commun
avec les autres humains
j'me souviens j'me suis dit quand je t'ai suivie
et si c'était la femme de ma vie ?

bye bye - bye bye
- écoute-moi bien j'vais t'dire pourquoi faut qu j'm'en aille

In your web of love I'm caught

As to whether we'd fit and I said

There it will be where we both can see
We'll meet in the Yellow Forest
(We'll meet)
There's a world that's made for you and me""

I caught you once again in your dance act
Your attitude has changed, you smiled at me

Que ha muerto una mujer que conocí,
Que ha perdido en su campo el Atleti
Y que ha amanecido nevando en París.
Que han pillado un alijo de coca,
Que a Piscis y Acuarios les toca
El vinagre y la hiel.
Que aprobó el Parlamento Europeo
Una ley a favor de abolir el deseo
Que falló la vacuna anti SIDA,
Que un golpe de estado ha triunfado en la luna
Y movidas así.
Pero nada decía la prensa de hoy de esta sucia pasión,
De este lunes marrón
Del obsceno sabor a cubata de ron de tu piel,
Del olor a colonia barata del amanecer.
Hoy amor, como siempre
El diario no hablaba de ti, ni de mí.
Hoy amor, igual que ayer, como siempre
El diario no hablaba de ti, ni de mí.
Hoy dijo la radio
Que han hallado muerto al niño que yo fui
Que han pagado un pasote de pelas
Por una acuarela falsa de Dalí.
Que ha cado la bolsa en el cielo,
Que siguen las putas en huelga de celo en Moscú.
Que subió la marea,
Que fusilan mañana a Jesús de Judea,
Que creció el agujero de ozono,
Que el hombre de hoy es el padre del mono del año 2000.
Pero nada decía el programa de hoy de este eclipse de mar,
De este salto mortal,
De tu voz tiritando en la cinta del contestador,
De la manchas que deja el olvido a través del colchón.
Hoy amor, como siempre
El diario no hablaba de ti, ni de mí.
Hoy amor, igual que ayer, como siempre
El diario no hablaba de ti, ni de mí."

Oh no (Oh no) Oh no (Oh no, no, no)

Mr. Jones has a little problem
If I had eyes I'd see that it was me
He's the size of a man with the potential of a boy
Not what god had meant a child of it's to be
I'm afraid that he'll amount to all of nothing
The joy of reading Yeats he'll never know
And In the rat race twirl
Of our computer guided world
He stands no chance of winning
Let alone to place a show so...

Lock him up and throw away the key boys
Mr. Jones is not like you or me
Lock him up tight cause if he had the chance he might
Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be
Oh no (Oh no) Oh no (Oh no, no, no)

Mr. Jones wanted to be married
It seemed like such a cute thing at the time
Two peas in a pod, two of a kind
Who'd never have to ask each other:
""What is on your mind?"" ('What's on your mind')
It seemed a simple way to make them happy
And happy's such a simple way to be
And if they kept to themselves like two books upon a shelf
The kind you judge by the cover
And never take the time to read

So lock 'em up and throw away the key boys
The Joneses they're not like you or me
Lock 'em up tight cause of they had the chance they might
Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be
Oh no...

Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jones we're elated to inform you
Though you've failed to meet the standards
We've a place where we'll reform you
It's a ways outside of town
But the distance has its uses
Close enough to make the effort
Far enough to make excuses

Lock 'em up and throw away the key boys
The Joneses they're not like you or me
Lock 'em up tight cause if they had the chance they might
Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be
Oh no (Oh no) Oh no (Oh no, no, no)

Mrs. Jones wants to have a baby
She says that as a woman it's her right
Yes we tried to tell her I guess that she forgot
When she and Mr. Jones were wed
The doctor's tied the knot
Why can't she just be happy in her own world
Then we can all be happy here in ours
We could still help out, even go as far
As to stop off at the Safeway, drop some pennies in the jar so...

Lock her up and throw away the key boys
Mrs. Jones is not like you or me
Lock her up tight cause if she had the chance she might
Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be so
Lock 'em up and throw away the key boys
The Joneses they're not like you or me
Lock 'em up tight cause if they had the chance they might
Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be

He smiled the smile of murder
And in his head, shook his hand

It's beautiful and soothing, it's logic and it's sane
Take me through the evening, on my 32nd floor
And I'll never ask for more

Money is the heartache, moral is the shame
Duty comes to those who love the numbers and the name
So find the State of Israel, find the State of Rome
Crush the fools, in huts of clay, there's danger in the garden

Take me to your Station, take me through your mind
Drop that code you give me, just let me feel your mind
Take me through the evening, on my 32nd floor

Hit me in the darkroom, I've never loved before
I've shook and screamed in lonely times
But I've never loved before

Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say HI
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Let's break it down, we're rollin nationally, clockin hoes
Well, just to turn em into freaks, but if they turn to foes
We don't need em, we know too many backstabbers now
In our face they say they're with it, behind they back they put us down
And try to clown a player like me, 187 from 'Mona
And my homie the rancher from the city of Toners
I hit a corner, cause they ballers in L.A.
We give our props to the homies that be clockin on the Trey
They sayin, ""What's up, gees, tell me what's happenin
I heard you're clockin dollars, but you're still out there rappin""
You should know, it's my cash flow, now I'm just hangin
With these beats called dope and these rhymes that I'm slingin
That are so fly, we can't deny, we must reply
If we twist it in two zags, we can all get high
Off this shit, it's so legit, label it Chronic
Cause if our rhymes was a robot, they'd all be Bionic
Get up and get with it, if not, we feel we're owin
Throw your hands in the air while we keep on flowin

[Cold 187um]
Yo KM.G, I think we got em locked on
See, flowin is a art from the heart of a player
So we gon' do the next one like this, man

[VERSE 2: Cold 187um &amp; KM.G]
People say we have such strange vocabulary
To find these words you need a underground dictionary
Plus trey lifetimes of the inner city knowledge
And to get this, boy, you see, you can't go to college
Now see, you gotta be around when the shit goes down
Not only spectating, man, you gotta throw down
Yeah, and check em in a bottle like if you were at Ceasar's
Or maybe over somethin like money and skeezers
That's why we got this rule: first come, first served
And if you don't know the meaning, just listen to the words
I'm sayin, I don't be playin when I'm housin the scene
I keep my Locs on, because I know you on fiend
But I take them off, it's just because I'm scrappin
But I put em back on as I commence to rappin
Well, we do a show, rock the house and get paid
Take a bitch to the mote, then get laid
Send her home with a smile, cause it's worth her while
She's to the homies how she did it and she went the mile
I'm talkin whole nine yards, if you can understand
Cause I'm a playin muthafucka and I'm in demand
So flow on

[KM.G]
See
Untouchable players in effect
Makin all the big pay-offs
Callin all the shots 
Ballin
Punishin punk muthafuckas on the 12-gauges
I call on K-oss
Knowledge Over Sucker-Spinners
Dopeness jumpin off
Gots to be platinum-bound
O.G. G-O, a mack, a arson, a chiller and a killer
A double-dose of the mega-flex
Like all you gees that think you're niggas with attitudes
You ain't got it like that
Cause Ruthless done fixed that
(Hey yo, what happened to peace?)
Fuck peace
I'm outta here"

Pounding their way through your head see it all in your eyes
Reflections of overindulgence you're barely alive
Washing away in a swirling mass of confusion you're going to break!
On the edge
Living faster you live
On the edge!
Time after time anytime anyplace.. just don't care
Headstrong and blind plunging headlong no mind, unaware.
Head to the floor, face in the mud
Watch as you turn into ice!
On the edge
Because you do it so well
On the edge!
(Lead)
Now that your eyes hove been opened to what lies ahead
Don't be a loser, abuser, you may wind up dead!
Up off your ass!!! Take control 'cause the key to your destiny lies
within you!
On the edge
Living faster you live..
On the edge...!!!
Into the pit
down the hatch
Sinking fast
Can't get back
No way out
For you now
What the hell
Will you do"

Beati i vivi, i morti ma soprattutto i risorti
Beati sono i ricchi perché hanno il mondo in mano
Beati i potenti e i re e beato chi è sovrano
Beati i bulli di quartiere perché non sanno ciò che fanno
Ed i parlamentari ladri che sicuramente lo sanno
Beata è la guerra, chi la fa e chi la decanta
Ma più beata ancora è la guerra quando è santa
Beati i bambini che sorridono alla mamma,
Beati gli stranieri ed i soufflé di panna
Beati sono i frati, beate anche le suore
Beati i premiati con le medaglie d'oro
Beati i professori, beati gli arrivisti ,
I nobili e i padroni specie se comunisti
Beata la frontiera beata la finanza
Beata è la fiera ad ogni circostanza
Beata la mia prima donna che mi ha preso ancora vergine
Beato il sesso libero si ma entro un certo margine
Beati i sottosegretari i sottufficiali
Beati i sottaceti che ti preparano al cenone
Beati i critici e gli esegeti di questa mia canzone"

Elle passe aussitôt chez sa cousine Berthe

Roger travaille dans une usine
Qui sent bon l'oxyde de carbone
Tous les midis à la cantine
Il mange du poulet aux hormones

Roger admire beaucoup Lénine
Roger admire beaucoup Lennon
Et dans la fanfare de l'usine,
Le dimanche il joue du trombone

Et quand Roger sort du bureau
Il prend le bus de 18 heures 17
Et file tout droit au Club-à-gogo

Vous êtes belle comme une speakerine,
Venez chez moi j'vous jouerai du trombone""

Joséphine et Roger se marièrent
Ils eurent des quadruplés qu'ils prénommèrent
Gustave, Alphonse, Arthur et Philibert

Et leur apprirent le... ah
Et leur apprirent le... oh

Et leur apprirent le J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J-Jerk

Get up and make it snappy!
Dance like a psycho
A sight like nothing on earth
Keep a wide berth
From anyone you might know
So no first night nerves
All first serves! All aces!
Straight home bases
Sweating like a pig doing the jig
At the gig of the century
Because we'll never be
Told by the old school
Sold the old rules
Tho' we're no fools
Downbeats down to earth
You down with me?
Clowning round the town
Step easy
cooking up new tricks
Looking for a new kick
Found a new sound
Found that it sticks
Heard about the bird
'Bout the plane and
The superman?
Word is: We can outlast anyone
Supercede the superfly guys
Who will concede
They are dying flies
This range of suss
Could be dangerous
Let's test! At best it's religious
At worst a thirst
Bursting for the next rhyme
all times sacred
Even stripped naked
This damned nation
Needing salvation
Reach out!
Teach in musical elation
Shout! Get out of it get within it
Get out of it get within it
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped
Play it mad DJ! Play it bad DJ
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped
Are you with me
Are you with it?
A musical nasty
Fast as it has to be
A catastrophe
Heavy duty chaos
'Cos I'm all attitude
The dude to kickstart
The party mood
Cue the truth:
Sleuths are never sober
The proof of youth
So move over rover
Hey! Disco King
You've stopped dancing
Best admit
This hit's an obsession
Lost in lust
Better listen to the lessons
Bright lights big city
Broad minds
Bored pretty easily
Busted just for justice sake
They can't control a soul
Ther's an outbreak
Of outrageous love
It's contageous and
It's here to save us
Some say:
""Now way DJ don't play
The laterst the greatest
The mad and bad way.""
If it ain't music use it abuse it
Call it a wall of noise
But don't refuse it
This damned nation
Needing salvation
Reach out!
Teach in musical elation
Shout! Get out of it get within it
Get out of it get within it
Dedicated to all the bores
All the whores
Who forced the laws
You thought
We'd stop dancing and
You were wrong

Tried with our last gasp to grab the things we could not grasp but all the traps were built just to deceive. And now it's just a dream no basis in reality without a leg to stand on and nothing to believe.

So sit behind dark walls, with the curtains drawn in dim lit halls, the dimwit calls in vain,""No, not now please."" Nothing never new he was a slimy little rat eating slimy sewage from the bottom of a rat trap, eating polyester in a game he said he'd aim to please. Sits and wags his tail on time, never says nothing above the sublime for fear his trap just might be slamming shut.

In unknown words massacring the mind

Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Without you to love me
I'd just be wasting time
And goin' out of my mind

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere

Wherever would I be without you, tell me
If I didn't have you
Whatever would I do now baby
Whatever would I be without you
I'd be nowhere I'd be nowhere"
280,Kreator,Mental Slavery,TRXXKTK12903CE58E9,1990,"Land of solitude
A place of horror dark and cruel
There's no need to seek the truth
Opinions are provided for you
Innocence of youth
Full of visionary fantasies
From subconscious laboratories
Try to break the chains of barbarity

Servants to mother machine
Nursed by video screens
Paradise of insanity
Born into a grave of

Mental slavery
Lost in dark reality
Mental slavery

Memories of the past
Holy empires of harmony
Visions only children see
Are soon removed by society
Replaced by numbing fear
The horror show of rules sets in
Total control of thought begins
Another car on the highway of sin

Servants to mother machine
Nursed by video screens
Paradise of insanity
Born into a grave of

Mental slavery
Lost in dark reality
Mental slavery

Just one of a million slaves
An expendable commodity
This song's for those who serve
The system of terror
That rules the earth"
281,Hothouse Flowers,Dance To The Storm,TRUVWDV128F1482BCD,1990,"When I first saw you with hair like a river
Eyes like the sky
This real feeling came right up inside me
And I felt like flying
And I still see you, you smiling angel I see your eyes
And I'll remember just the way you talked to me and
The way I cried
I cried

Rejoice in the sunrise
Dance to the moonlight
Dance to the storm

You are the sweetest angel, you are the highest flyer
I know it's true
There'll never be another quite as beautiful
Quite like you

Dance
And then I saw you, you were alone by the river
Looking for love
This real feeling came right up inside me
I give you love"
282,Johnny Gill,My_ My_ My,TRHMZUP128F1499F44,1990,"So good
My, My, My
Listen
Put on your red dress

And slip on your high heels
And some of that sweet perfume
It sure smells good on you
Slide on your lipstick

Let your hair down
'Cause Baby when you get through
I'm going to show you
Tonight will be a special night

No matter where we go
And I'm so proud to be with you
I just want to let you know

You got my saying
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

And your so damn fine
I gotta say
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

After all this time
Slip on your nightgown
Step into our bedroom
First I want to take sometime

I just want to look at you
Girl you are so fine
I can't believe you're mine
And all I want to do

I want to make love to you
Tonight will be a special night
A minute more to come
And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

Make love all night long
Make love all night long
'Til the dawn
Come on
Come on
Sweet little thing I need you

And I'm so proud to be with you
So proud to share you're love
My, My, My
My, My, My
You sure look good tonight

I want to love you in everyway
I want to love you in everyway
Let me
Let me

Show you how sweet it's gonna be
I want to show you things that you
Never, ever, ever seen before

Put your nightgown on
Let your hair hang low
Step into our room
I'm in the mood to love you all night long

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My
My, My, My

283,Rachelle Ferrell,BYE BYE BLACKBIRD,TRRQQZA128F14664A5,1990,"Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet and so is he
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love and understand love me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
I'll pack my bag and light the light
I'll arrive home late tonight
Blackbirdbye bye"
284,Reagan Youth,Go Nowhere,TRRJYLR128F932AA83,1990,"You're a gonowhere! And you don't care!
You're a gonowhere! You're not even there!

Living your life on the conveyor belt
No time to think so your brain just melts
No destination you're lost inside
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind! Go!...

A whole generation of gonowheres
The living dead in 3-D life
A whole generation of stagnant lives
Standing still, deaf dumb and blind

You're a gonowhere! And you don't care!
You're a gonowhere! You're fucking lost!"
285,Guardian,Takin' On The World  (Album Version),TRGETZZ128F423A7C7,1990,"I've been ridin' ten thousand miles
of memories; been up and down
and 'round this crazy world. I'm just
a simple man, but one thing that 
I know for sure¦ in this life there 
ain't no middleground
The things I want to say, the world
don't want to hear. Don't care
what people say, gonna say it
laud and clear
CHORUS:
T-T-T-Takin' on the world, you know
we're takin' on the world.
T-T-T-Takin' on the world you know
we're takin' on the world
Most of my life, my heart was
chained to empty dreams; took my
fill but it never was enough. Then
Holy Fire burned right thru my
empty soul, took ahold, won't ever
let me go.
The things I want to say, the world
don't have to fear; don't care what
people say, gonna say it loud
and clear
CHORUS
T-T-T-Takin' on the world, you know
we're takin' on the world. Jesus
ain't no joke to me, He's the One
that set me free. I'm takin' on the
world, you know we're takin' on
the world. Yes I know that time will
tell; I'll be standing at the bell¦
Takin' on the world
I Timothy 1:15-17 / I John 5:4"
286,Anita Baker,Whatever It Takes (LP Version),TRCUJFS128F9341D23,1990,"I've always told you
I'd give you anything
My baby you've been my best, 
my only friend
There's nothing like the joy you bring

I wonder what would happen
If you would trust in me
I'd make you believe, I'd make you see
No need to run from me

I'd make you feel like never before
Here I stand, heart in hand, help me find
The door
Anybody can see baby, you've been
Hurt before
Let me heal all your pain, won't ever hurt
No more

Whatever it takes to make you happy, baby
Whatever it takes to make you smile
Whatever it takes to make you feel good, baby
I'll be around

One moment spent near you
Rules all my pain
Your miracle soothes me
Your hurricane moves me
I cannot explain

Burdens get heavy
Become too much to bear
Honey, don't you say nothing
Hold on, I'm coming
I want you to know that I'll be there

I'll make you feel like never before
Willing and able, baby, open up the door
Anybody can see, baby, you've been
Hurt before

Let me heal all your pain
Never let you hurt anymore
Oh, ahh, ahh, hmmm
My, my, my, my, my
Hmmmm"
