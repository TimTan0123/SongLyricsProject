1,Billie Holiday,No Good Man,TRBWDAE128F92F9FB5,1946,"No good man
Lovin' all the no good things
Never treats me as he should
That ain't no good
He's always bringing me down
He's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly
Not on me
I'm the one who gets the run-around

I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms
I find
I always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no good man"
2,Billie Holiday,Good Morning Heartache,TRAFPKJ12903CC6148,1946,"Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you
But you're here to stay
It seems I met you 
When my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning, heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down"
3,Frank Sinatra,You Go To My Head,TRBHGJS12903CBA45C,1946,"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head"
4,Frank Sinatra,Try A Little Tenderness,TRFWSJP12903CC4DC2,1946,"INTRO:
In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much
A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realize

She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness

She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness"
5,Frank Sinatra,Someone To Watch Over Me,TREMKOC12903CE11C6,1946,"There's a somebody 
I'm longing to see
I hope that she
Turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man
Some girls think of
As handsome
To her heart
I'll carry the key

Won't you tell her please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell her please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh....how I need
Someone to watch
Over me"
6,Hank Thompson,Whoa Sailor,TRFAGNN128F92E3DC0,1946,"I'll tell you 'bout my night on shore if you will lend an ear
I stepped into a cabaret to get myself a beer
A pretty girl sat all alone and needed company
But when I got close, this girl a rose this is what she said to me

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, be careful what you do
In your eye there's a gleam
And to me it seems you're just like all the rest
With a wolfish eye and a line that's sly than a sailor's at his best""

""Now look here, babe, you've got me wrong, I'm not that kinda guy
I just got back from across the seas where there are no gals arie
Now let me talk to you a while, I'm sure you'll see my way""
But when I went to spout she turned about this is what she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I've heard that line before
You'll look into my eyes
And tell me lies and tales of the seven seas
But a sailor's full of that kinda bull so don't hand it to me

""Oh pretty girl, you've let me down, you've broken my poor heart
And oh, how it hurt when you had to spurt that last sad remark""
I said, ""I think I'll have a drink and I broke out six month's pay""
With a wide open eyes she breathed a sigh this time she had to say

Now she said, ""Whoa sailor, I think you've won my heart""
Well, she was right neat and she sure was sweet
But I knew she was that sort but she's not all to blame
'Cause it's a sailor's aim to have a girl in every port"
7,Louis Jordan & His Tympany Five,Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens,TRUYNYP128E0783594,1946,"One night farmer Brown was takin' the airs
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house, somethin' stirred
When he shouted, ""Who's there?""
This is what he heard

""There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble hobble hobble with your chin""

""There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
You're kickin' up an awful dust
We chicken's tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble hobble hobble, it's a sin""

""Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, We got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of settin', gettin' chicks to hatch""

""Ohh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble hobble of and hit the hay""

""Tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of settin', gettin' chicks to hatch""

""There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
And kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble hobble of and hit the hay""

""Hey, hey, boss man, what do ya say?
It's easy pickings
Ain't nobody here but us chickens"""
8,Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five,Beware,TRCLVDZ128F426E7D8,1946,"Hey, fellas, yes, you, fellas, listen to me, I got something to tell you
And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly

Now, you see these girls with these fine diamonds, fine furs and fine clothes
Well, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who knows
They ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them
You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'

Listen, if she saves you dough, and won't go to the show
Beware
If she's easy to kiss and won't resist
Beware

And if you go for a walk, and she listens while you talk
She's tryin' to hook you

And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'
Don't do it, don't do it
And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row
Bring her down front, bring her right down front

If you wanna go for a snack, and she wants to sit in the booth in the back
Beware

And listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk
When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk
She's trying to get you

If you're used to goin' to carnegie hall, but when you take her out night clubing
All she wants is one meatball
You better take it easy

If she grabs your hand and says, ""darling, you're such a nice man""
Beware, I'm telling you

(Should I tell them no more?)
(Tell them everything)

You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put down
You better pick up on it

If her sister calls your brother, you better get further
I'm telling you, you better watch it

And if she's acting kind of wild, and she says, ""darling, give me a trial""
Don't you do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her
And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place
Let her melt, forget it, let her melt

(Should I tell them no more?)
(Tell them everything)

Now listen, if she calls you up on the phone, and says
""Darling, are you all alone?""
Tell her, ""no, no, I've got two, three women with me""

Don't pay no attention to women
Stand up for your right, be a man, be a man

(Are you listening?)
If you turn out the lights and she don't fight
That's the end, it's too late
She's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her

(Should I tell them no more?)

If you get home about two and don't know what to do
You pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you
Get your business straight
Set the date, don't be late

Brother, beware, beware, beware
Brother, you better beware"
9,Wynonie Harris,Here Comes The Blues,TROFQGR12903C94E69,1946,"Monday is shining
You know 'em Tuesday's rain
Well, the days go by me
Like a southbound train
Yes, it's funny thinking
You will never call my name
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, the world's the same old comedy

You know my time is cold
Nothing new, blue lady
I won't get old
Cause the deal is gone now
I'd just better hold
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, sun has run down
She has gone out to hide
Yes, and now I'm out walking
Where the midnight ride
Just me and the good-time Charlies

And the suicide
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Well, Monday's dry
Yes, and Tuesday's just the same
Maybe come down blue Wednesday
I'm gonna grab the brakes again

Cause no bottle of pills
Could ever kill this pain
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues
Here comes long lonely
Here comes the blues"
