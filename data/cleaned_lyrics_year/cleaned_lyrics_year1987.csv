0,The Four Lads,Moments To Remember,TRARXNO128F92F3006,1987,"January to December, we'll have moments to remember

The New Year's Eve we did the town
The day we tore the goal post down
We'll have these moments to remember

The quiet walks, the noisy fun
The ballroom prize we almost won
We will have these moments to remember

Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years

When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember

SPOKEN:

The drive in movie where we'd go
And somehow never watched the show
We will have these moments to remember

Though summer turns to winter
And the present disappears
The laughter we were glad to share
Will echo through the years

When other nights and other days
May find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember"
1,Blue Rodeo,Heart Like Mine,TRERWKJ128F423B7CE,1987,"Lead Vocals by Greg and Jim

Don't you know that we're out of touch,
Yeah, we fight too much, 
How'd we ever get so messed up?
Everynight, we say the craziest things
You know our words they once had wings.

Now it's all covered up
In double-talk and lies
There's a stranger looking back
When I look in your eyes.

(repeat above)

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

You call me a fool, 'cause I still feel the same.
You say that your love has changed, 
Ah! Here we go again
Close your eyes tell me what do you see
Do you still remember me?
Like some Mexican diplomat
After the fact
Air-brushed from history
Swept under the mat.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

And as I walk out the door
I step into a dream. 
The world's quiet and I feel free,
But things are never what they seem
But then I hear you call
And warn myself - now don't go back
But slow motion attacks
Like some Mexican diplomat
After the fact
Air-brushed from history
Swept under the mat.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine."
2,The Housemartins,Bow Down,TRLUVQL128F145A5C5,1987,"Mother, father, I think that I would rather
Stay at home with you for another year
That building's so tall and it makes me feel so small
That I might get lost and simply disappear
Evil smiles won't change my mind
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind
Why's that man rubbing his hands
Looking at me writing down his plans? 

Today I have been moulding plasticine
And I made a little man who looked just like me
His limbs were so weak and he couldn't move hiw mouth to speak
And I could bend him into any shape I wanted him to be

Evil smiles won't change my mind
I'm worried and I'm not the worrying kind
Why's that man rubbing his hands
Looking at me writing down his plans? 

Those kids with the blazers on
They went in with names on their elbows
Came home with medals on
Spit it out that's the way the story goes

A flying start for the briefcase crew

Oh, you didn't have to teach me like you did
But you did
And you didn't have to beat me like you did
But you did
But you did
You did
You did"
3,T'Pau,Bridge Of Spies,TRZTCQC128F1458ABE,1987,"So long I've waited
For you to come to me
Anticipated what I would say
And no one could know
How it feels to be
In your embrace again
So tender
Yes, there were times
I could not hold on
Each day that came
A little more hope was gone
I'd look into my heart
To see what I had done
And now I can't believe
The day is finally come

I am walking
Over the bridge of spies today
Freedom is only one more step away
You only have to hold me
Take me to you

Now the things we wanted
They're so far away it seems
And your love is a distant thing
That I kept deep inside of me
Now if I could show you
Where I lived in my fantasy
On the continent of dreams
You'd be with me

I don't know if I could go through it all again
For what's the point if you are never free to say
This is what I believe
This is a part of me
No hero, no regrets
But only meant to be

I am walking
Over the bridge of spies today
Freedom is only one step away
You only have to hold me

I am walking
Over the bridge of spies today
Freedom is only one step away
You only have to hold me"
4,Carnivore,Carnivore (Demo) (Album Version),TRFELQC128F423B55F,1987,"Greetings and felicitations, children of technology!

Drool dripping out, my tongue hanging south
Saliva flowing free
My eyes full of lust, my balls gonna bust
Give yourself to me
Thirst I can't quench; c'mere, you wench
There's something I need

Carnivore — I'm a meat eater
Carnivore — I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore — I know I'll reach ya
Carnivore

The hunger I feel makes you a meal
Ooh girl, you sure taste sweet
By my hair, pull me there
Guide me to that treat
Spread your legs, I'll seed your eggs
Oh, feel me deep

Carnivore — I'm a meat eater
Carnivore — I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore — I know I'll reach ya
Carnivore — I'd love to eat ya

I'm going down! Dive! Dive!

""Lick me,"" she begged, she pulled down my head
I love to eat pussy!
A taste so fine like sweet April wine
I won't trade for any money
Did you cum? I eat and run
I live for sodomy!

Carnivore — I'm a meat eater
Carnivore — I'd like to meet ya
Carnivore — I know I'll reach ya
Carnivore — I'd love to eat ya"
5,Camper Van Beethoven,Never Go Back,TRVRRPP128F92F894F,1987,"Never gonna go back to The Rat
Play another Mafia show again
For a man who's had more feet kicked in his face than I can begin to count

And if you see me sitting around
Thinking the same old thoughts over and over again
Or going back to old ways I've long ago abandoned
Please, tell me
Never go back

There might come a time when things between us get
Just a little bit too weird
We'll move to different cities for a temporary vacation
But it's just as you feared
Never go back

If you see me sitting around
Thinking the same old thoughts over and over again
Or going back to old ways I've long ago abandoned,
Please, tell me
Never go back"
6,Percy Sledge,You Really Got A Hold On Me,TRUPAVU128F92FD9A1,1987,"I don't like you, but I love you

You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me  (You really got a hold on me)
Baby

I don't want you, but I need you
Don't want to kiss you ,but I need to
Tho you do me wrong now, my love is strong now

You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me  (You really got a hold on me)

I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hoooold me

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here, oh 
I want to split now, I can't quit now

You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me (You really got a hold on me)
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hoooold me

7,Purple Schulz,Gib Mir,TRFGEKR128F423E11A,1987,"Gib mir die Kraft das durchzuhalten
Gib mir den Mut weiterzugehen
Gib mir die Hoffnung in der tiefsten Nacht
Den nächsten Tag zu sehen
Gib mir den Mut mich aufzulehnen
Hilf, meine Liebe zu bewahren
Gib mir die Stimme, in der Stille
Die Wahrheit laut zu sagen

Gib mir den Blick all das zu sehen
Was täglich um mich rum geschieht
Gib mir Verstand es zu verstehen
Gib mir Kraft das aufzuhalten,
Was uns so unaufhaltsam scheint
Gib mir die Wärme in der kalten Zeit
Laß mich nicht erfrieren
Gib mir die Kraft nie aufzugeben
Trotz all der Dummheit, Ignoranz

Gib mir den Mut zurück zum Leben
Laß mich nie resignieren
Gib mir die Zeit den Weg zu gehen
Auch wenn er lang und steinig ist
Gib mir die Kraft es durchzustehen

Doch laß mich niemals den Verstand verlieren
Laß mich niemals Kinder schlagen
Laß mich niemals eine Waffe führen
Laß mich immer und zu jeder Zeit
Alles hinterfragen"
8,Meat Puppets,Sexy Music (Album Version),TRXMFWL128F147BC7C,1987,"Let me see everything
Let me live forever
Give me wings and show me how
To control the weather

Give me the mountains
Give me the sea
And build a mighty tower
Especially for me

Unearthly visions filled my head
As I lay there and sexy music
Tumbled all around
And then the music turned to
Emerald feathered goblins
That cast their burning pearls
To the ground

Fill the tower up with food
The kind I love to eat
Send a couple maidens
With soft hands to rub my feet

Give me superhuman strength
To wipe out what is wrong
Give me all of everything
I've wanted for so long

Unearthly visions filled my head
As I lay there and sexy music
Tumbled all around
And then the music turned to
Emerald feathered goblins
That cast their burning pearls
To the ground

Hot as the sun
The red rubber fountain of ecstasy
Flows from the palms of my hands
Like the wind
Hot as the sun

Hot as the sun
The red rubber fountain of ecstasy
Flows from the palms of my hands
Like the wind
Hot as the sun

Unearthly visions filled my head
As I lay there and sexy music
Tumbled all around
And then the music turned to
Emerald feathered goblins
That cast their burning pearls
To the ground

Unearthly visions filled my head
As I lay there and sexy music
Tumbled all around
Unearthly visions filled my head
As I lay there and sexy music
Tumbled all around"
9,Deacon Blue,Born In A Storm,TRLCVJG128F42AD370,1987,"that hurricane day
will soon pass away
and someone will sweep
all the jetsam back into the bay

and you'll come
like you always did
and knock on my door
like the big bad wind

born in a storm
is that the only excuse you can give
born in a storm
is that all you're going to live"
10,Peggy Lee,I Don't Know Enough About You,TRYVFGF12903CAD66A,1987,"I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.
Just when I think you're mine,
You try a different line,
And baby, what can I do?

I read the latest news,
No buttons on my shoes,
But baby, I'm confused about you.
You get me in a spin,
Oh what a stew I'm in,
'Cause I don't know enough about you.

Jack of all trades, master of none,
And isn't it a shame,
I'm so sure that you'd be good for me,
If you'd only play my game!

You know I went to school,
And I'm nobody's fool,
That is to say until I met you!
I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.

You know I went to school,
And I'm nobody's fool,
That is to say until I met you!
I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.

I know a little bit about biology,
And a little more about psychology,
I'm a little gem in geology,
But I don't know enough about you.

I guess Id better get out the encyclopedia
And fresh up on from ""shmer"" to ""shmoo"", mmmm,
'Cause I don't know enough about you."
11,7 Seconds,Copper Ledge (Album Version),TREACUY128F147BDE1,1987,"Here we sit like we have many times
Familiar feeling
Hear the change of thousands pouring in

Yeah, dealers, bosses, white and black
There's eyes that watch us over
If there is a hell, this must be it

Hope is all you started with
You've seen as you walk in
Doubtful they could be your friends

A game you can depend on
This wicked thing is sin
It's ugly when you reach the end

The time is nonexistent
Stranger people stay insistent
You may win but do you win a thing?

Old hands now black from filthy money
Tickets from the pawn shops
Back tomorrow
Does this make much sense?

Hope is all you started with
You've seen as you walk in
Doubtful they could be your friends

A game you can depend on
This wicked thing is sin
It's ugly when you reach the end

This town means nothing
This town will never grow
This town's a ghost town
You really outta know

Wheels spin, the sounds of ringing
Pain inside my head
I think it's better just to find the edge

It's safe up here, I'm staying
I'd rather watch some other's fail
Like a king up on this Copper Ledge"
12,Alabama,The Closer You Get,TRVNNMF128F4285161,1987,"(Mark Gray/James P. Pennington)

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all.
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall.

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

The closer you get, (oh baby) the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all.
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, (em hmm) the further I fall

Could I be dreamin'
Is this really real
'Cause there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight.

The closer you get, (oh yeah) the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all.
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, (em hmm) the further I fall.

Keep fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, keep fallin', 
Mm, fallin', oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fallin'.

Has been mislaid by the depth in your eyes
See me living in the middle of England
Set my course for the deepest heavens
Dress me up like a rocket ship
And drag you screaming into my belly
Railing, complaining

And I seal my girl inside
'Cause she's my girl and I'm her planet ride
Seal my girl inside
'Cause she's my girl and I'm her planet ride

Well, I push you kicking into my airtight machine
Fuel my love, I'm a big gas turbine
Come and leave my big black city
Big black city under western skies
Railing, complaining

And I seal my girl inside
'Cause she's my girl and I'm her planet ride
Seal my girl inside
'Cause she's my girl and I'm her planet ride

She leads me out into the pastures green
And wall-to-wall divine carpet under my feet
I cup her chin in my hands and cry
""I love you, sweedeedee, I love you
Come and hang 'em on the line next to mine""

Well, I think my world is fading in fire
Fading world in a burning sky
Think my world is fading in fire
I'm on fire in a burn, burn, burn, burn
Railing, complaining

And I seal my girl inside
'Cause she's my girl and I'm her planet ride

Sur le mariage d'une étoile et d'un lion

18,Jean-Jacques Goldman,Puisque Tu Pars,TRKJWKP128F92FD614,1987,"Puisque l'ombre gagne
Puisqu'il n'est pas de montagne
Au-delà des vents plus haute que les marches de l'oubli
Puisqu'il faut apprendre
À défaut de le comprendre
À rêver nos désirs et vivre des « Ainsi soit-il »

Et puisque tu penses
Comme une intime évidence
Que parfois même tout donner n'est pas forcément suffire
Puisque c'est ailleurs
Qu'ira mieux battre ton cœur
Et puisque nous t'aimons trop pour te retenir

Puisque tu pars

Que les vents te mènent
Où d'autres âmes plus belles
Sauront t'aimer mieux que nous puisque l'on ne peut t'aimer plus
Que la vie t'apprenne
Mais que tu restes le même
Si tu te trahissais nous t'aurions tout à fait perdu

Garde cette chance
Que nous t'envions en silence
Cette force de penser que le plus beau reste à venir
Et loin de nos villes
Comme octobre l'est d'avril
Sache qu'ici reste de toi comme une empreinte indélébile

Sans drame, sans larme
Pauvres et dérisoires armes
Parce qu'il est des douleurs qui ne pleurent qu'à l'intérieur
Puisque ta maison
Aujourd'hui c'est l'horizon
Dans ton exil essaie d'apprendre à revenir

Mais pas trop tard

Dans ton histoire
Garde en mémoire
Notre au revoir
Puisque tu pars

Dans ton histoire
Garde en mémoire
Notre au revoir
Puisque tu pars

J'aurai pu fermer
Oublier toutes ces portes
Tout quitter sur un simple geste
Mais tu ne l'as pas fait

J'aurai pu donner
Tant d'amour et tant de force
Mais tout ce que je pouvais
Ça n'était pas encore assez

Pas assez
Pas assez
Pas assez
Pas assez"

A lonely man
Who lost his love
Through his indifference
A heart that cared
That went unshared
Until it died
Within his silence

And solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

And keeping to himself
Begins to deal
And still the king of hearts
Is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And he deals them out again

A little hope
Goes up in smoke
Just how it goes
Goes without saying
There was a man
A lonely man
Who would command
The hand he's playing

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

And keeping to himself
Begins to deal
And still the king of hearts
Is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And he deals them out again

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him
Takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire"

No one else can make me feel this way
When our eyes meet there's a fire
Burning deep inside my heart
I just can't live without your loving
Ev'rything is cold and dark, ev'rytime that we're apart

CHORUS :

So you'd better take good care of this heart of mine
Yes, you'd better take good care of this heart of mine
Maybe I'd better say a prayer to the stars that shine
Oh you'd better take good care of this heart of mine

Every minute of ev'ry passing day
Goes so slowly when you're away
Ev'ry hour seems like an eternity
Wondering when you'll be back with me
But when our eyes meet there's the fire
And I can't control the flames
If I ever lost your loving
It would break my heart in two

When everything was so home - grown
Three was such a terrier a tearaway
As bloody blue as she can get
Four would sing so easy
With his cowboy sway
Dan Hicks could just walk on the set

Bridge ~
I never said I was faultless
But I refuse to take the blame
You know one thing's doubtless
We were all friends by name
Free spirits all turn out the same

Chorus ~
The living and the dead
The traffic in your bed
Count it all out
What do you see
The money that you owe
The love you didn't show
Somewhere tonight
They're counting on me

Five he tore the town up
With a trick and a gun
He rolled the car on Fisherman's Bend
I always bore the mantle
Of the fortunate one
A story that will never end
A story that will never end

Bridge

The living and the dead
The traffic in your bed
Count it all out
What do you see
The money that you owe
The love you didn't show
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere
They're counting on me

Bridge

The living and the dead
The traffic in your bed
Count it all out now
What do you see
The money that you owe
The love you didn't show
Somewhere tonight
Somewhere tonight
They're counting on me"

Is without you
Let the rain fall from the skies
Let the waters
Close around me
Keep the sunlight from my eyes
Bitter harvest
Far horizons
Never see the sun
Restless searching

Leanin' on
Searching for two lives to be as one
If forever
Is without you
Let the rain fall from the skies
Let the waters
Close around me
Keep the sunlight from my eyes

Changing seasons
Indecision
Tearin' us apart
As an island
No man stands
Lonely days make a lonely heart
If forever
Is without you
Let the rain fall from the skies

Let the waters
Close around me
Keep the sunlight from my eyes
Keep the sunlight from my eyes"

when you're about to fall in love
look for hidden signs or you'll begin to sigh
Never trust the moon
when you're about to taste his kiss
he knows all the lies and lives up to lie
just wait for a night
when the skies are all bare
and see
if you care

never trust your dreams
when you're about to fall in love
or your dreams will quickly fall apart
so if you're smart, really smart
only trust your heart"

Love has come crashing down
The truth has been lost and found

'Cause you are to me
What you want to be
Don't say it's love, baby
If our friendship is to survive
Don't say it's love

We've shared so many secrets
Now kiss and tell
You make one move to love me
And it's farewell

'Cause somewhere there's someone
Who's waiting for you
To love you more than I could
Your heart was misunderstood

Don't say it's love, baby
'Cause you are to me
What you want to be
Don't say it's love, baby
If our friendship is to survive
Don't say it's love

Don't be a fool
You'll be alone in your confusion
If loving me is an illusion
Then let it go
Oh no no no no

Now I never counted
On ending this way
I always trusted fate
But if we are no too late

Don't say it's love, baby

To believe in
All the things they promised
They're always lies

Well it's something
Oh it's something to believe in
You know it's something

Every little once in a while
You take a chance to win
On a turning card
But it may be hard
We could be fooled on the merry-go-round
But I'm trying to find
Something to believe in
To believe in
All the things they promised
You know they always lied

Well it's something
Oh it's something to believe in
You know it's something

I've been willing and strong all along
Through chilling times
In a sea of heartbreak
Where you give and take
I won't give in to promises
Until I find something to believe in
To believe in

Well it's something
Oh it's something to believe in
You know it's something"

The queen is in the palace
But my sister's in the rain
Neon girls and gunshots
Tickin' through my brain 
They give you some detection
Bread and circus in your bed
A calculated showdown
It's very graphic bloodshed 
Better put your house in order
There's a fireball in the sky
Kiss the wife and kids so long
Kiss your ass goodbye 
It's the big time for love
It's the big time
It's the right time for love
It's the big time for love
This time it is
It's the big time

Burn all my credentials as I go

Whisky words tumble down in the street
With the pain that they cure
Sentimentally yours
From killermont street

And with collar upturned
I made it south to see
That the love I had spurned
Was just the hate in me

As the ships and the steel
Slip away to the cry of 'compete'
There's a message for us
We can get there by bus
From killermont street"
46,Jane Siberry,The White Tent The Raft (LP Version),TROOWCY12903CE7791,1987,"there's a red leaf
that falls from a purple tree
it falls it floats down
one red leaf against a clear blue sky
it floats down
past the marbles in the clearing
beneath the geese in flight
to the darkening river
in the autumn light
where it touches down
oh, like a great bird landing
tears of autumn 

there's a white tent that sits
in the middle of a raft
that floats down
floats down the middle of a river
of a stream floating down
and the tears streaming
from the mind's eye
streaming back beyond
the white sheets that flap and fly
oh, tears of wanting 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
fists and chests 

MANGO CLEARING:
oh Mango in the clearing
it's his leg or something
waiting
everything would be alright
watching the trees
then his toes
then the trees
deeper into the jungle
and leaves him there
we turn off the t.v.
never forget that night
never heard you
couldn't sleep
hotel window
get up to those dark peaks
everything would be 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
fists and chests 

GREAT OVERCOAT CLEARING:
and when it's not our great overcoat
it's a grey and yellow dress
so beautiful the bees
they followed you through the mall
to the clearing in the wilderness
and you lay down and I picked you up
and I said you must never leave
your beautiful hands
like knitting needles
and I said- it's Jane, it's me 

she said -
when you go that's when you go
lighten up and pass the cup
fifty bucks and that's all you got?
yeah, I love you 

there's a white tent that sits
in the middle of a raft that floats down
floats down the middle of a river
of a stream floating down
and the tears streaming
from the mind's eye
streaming back beyond the white sheets
that flap and fly
oh, tears of hardness 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
fists and chests 



OVERKILL CLEARING:
found the snake in the clearing
and it tried to kill him of course
but then...only after it tried to get away
he said -
youse the meanest ugliest low-down
and he cursed and swore
gonna shoot the damn thing
(I'll never let nobody hurt you)
I watched from the raft
and I withdrew my scent
it's not hard to kill a snake
it's not hard
it's not hard to kill a snake
it's not that hard 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
fists and chests 

ANGRY CLEARING:
what do you mean I love you
stop saying I love you
I don't know what you mean anyway
I don't know what love is and...
you don't know what love is and...
it doesn't change anything anyway 

ah...who cares
who gives a...
because all I see
is more hate
more fear
less light than before me 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
fists and chests 

BIRDS AT DAWN CLEARING:
get off my branch...
stick legs -they are not
this is my tree
it's getting lighter
I'm talking to you
turn down your radio
dawn is coming - run! 

every morning when the sun comes up
as loud as he can Get Up! Get Up!
yeah, I love you I love you a lot
lighten up and pass the cup 

there's a thousand white tents
on a thousand rafts all floating down
there's a thousand fists
and a thousand chests
they come thundering down
and the tears streaming
from a thousand eyes
streaming back beyond the white sheets
that flap and fly
oh, tears of hunger 

there's a white tent that blows
in the middle of a raft
that floats down down the middle
of a long and lonely dream
or is it lovely? can't always tell...
and the clearings pass
like blowing scarves
the slightly familiar
the slightly apart
and the river never runs dry
oh, tears of open 

the white tent the raft
the white tent the raft
and one red leaf
for my love...
for your love..."

I know this ain't no social call 
So, go ahead, get it off your mind

You heard what? Well, it ain't true 
I was here most all last night
I got over you the day you left 
Could it be somebody lied?

They said what? That I was cryin'?
I haven't shed a tear in years
That I spoke your name? Well, that's insane 
I've hardly noticed you're not here

That I showed your picture to some stranger?
Don't you think I've got no pride
They've been here at home, face down on a shelf 
Lord, I bet somebody lied

But if they were true 
What would it matter to you?
Would it change the way you feel?
If the rumors were right
Would you be here tonight 
To help this old heart heal

Well, don't worry, it wasn't me 
Just someone whose world was torn in two
Someone who looks a lot like me 
And loves someone like you

So, forget the tears I've never cried 
Lord, I bet somebody lied"

Everytime I see you
I get a feeling deep inside 
I want to be near you 
I want to be always by your side 
You know my wants, you know my needs 
You never turn your back on me
You know I play, you let me stray 
You're always there to rescue me 

Everytime I see you
Angels calling, stars are falling 
I hear sounds of love
When I'm near you 
Heavens singing hearts are ringing 
I hear sounds of love 

Everytime I see you 
I feel my secrets falling out 
When I'm near you 
I lose my defenses, drop my guards 
It's been so long, always so wrong
Love was never good to me 
I know you care, you're always there 
Your love was heaven sent to me

Everytime I see you
Angels calling stars are falling 
I hear sounds of love 
When I'm near you 
Heavens singing hearts are ringing 
I hear sounds of love
Everytime I'm near you 
My world is changing, fire's raging
I hear sounds of love
I want to be near you

Like him, I am doubtful
That your love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly
Proving your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around, heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr.

A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too

Comes a devil, calls your name
Can't you hear his echoing paces
Cold fingers point on you
Icy sounds cry into the night
Just a puppet in their play
A lonesome king calls his lonely crowd
Calls you home into decay

I coldly stare out to the sky

Someone's waiting someone smiles
Try to hide, try to turn away
You've got no chance to save your health
No chance to end up that old game

I coldly stare out to the sky

No time to pray a farewell, farewell
Another day, another life
A broken mirror cuts your face
Relentless words are driving mad

I coldly stare out to the sky"

Hoping the sun don't come up too fast

'Til the roses smell just like death

I swear to God I tried
Just turned around one day and you were gone

No sé cómo parar esta cabeza
Por qué no prueban una noche
Cuando llegan a su casa
No haya nadie y el teléfono no suena
¿A ver qué pasa?
Entonces yo me quedo acá
Bailando hasta que se vaya la noche."
66,Richard Marx,Hold On To The Nights,TRAAPPQ12903D0129F,1987,"Just when I believed
I couldn't ever want for more
This ever changing world
Pushes me through another door

I saw you smile
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face
Just for a while
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain
Something that took us by surprise?
Promises in vain
Love that is real but in disguise

What happens now?
Do we break another rule? Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Well, I think I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free
Everytime I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware
That the someone I've been searching for is right there

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I'm wishing I could give you more

Oh
Hold on to the nights"

Our food is almost gone
Death wraps his shirt around us
Soon we'll be carried home

Goodbye dear wife and children
May you be treated kind
For now our time has come to die
Locked up in the Coal Creek Mine

Eleven of us were imprisoned
And two dear ones have died
Nine more are left to suffer
And die in the Coal Creek Mine

Dear friends, you should take a warning
And listen to what we say
You're now in the world of sunlight
And there you'd better stay"
72,Eric B. & Rakim,I Know You Got Soul,TRIHJTR12903CD2C9E,1987,"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till  you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard,  it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next?  then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)"

Where they going and what they were doing

Get that sound, still get that sound of the old west 

Everyone's looking out, looking for something new
There is still one old sound that still rings true
Out there upon the hill, out there upon the plain
You can still hear the cowboys sing again 

Everyone knows what's done
Everyone knows that songs must still be sung 

If you can see the big sky, if you can hear the call
Maybe you might just be west of London Town

And who will be there to hear you when you call?
Who will see the madness in your life?
And who will be there to catch you if you fall?

Through the night, not a care in the world
And over there, over the twinkling of the lights
Harbor lights, say goodnight one more time

Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll join you tonight at the bottom of the well
Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea

I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane

We move and groove and cut loose from fear
We should kill time, we'll shut it down
I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you
Opening in my head

Bright glass on a chain being wound around us
The toiling of idle hands
Dripping
With guilt
A secret form of punishment
Axes through skulls
Shadow of futility
Endless
Revolt
The shifting of light and shadows

Dividing each existence
No one is right
Nothing is solid
Nothing can be held in my hands for long

Discontinuity
Sandy beaches
Bridges sinking into the sea
Beautiful confusion
You're a fading memory

The wind blows hard, pulls these clothes around
I harbour all the same worries as most
The temptations to leave or to give up the ghost
I wrestle with an outlook on life
That shifts between darkness and shadowy light
I struggle with words for fear that they'll hear
But Orpheus sleeps on his back, still dead to the world

Sunlight falls, my wings open wide
There's a beauty here I cannot deny
And bottles that tumble and crash on the stairs
Are just so many people I knew never cared
Down below on the wreck of the ship
Are a stronghold of pleasures I couldn't regret
But the baggage is swallowed up by the tide
As Orpheus keeps to his promise and stays by my side

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Believe me, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my Orpheus sing

Sleepers sleep as we row the boat
Just you, the weather and I gave up hope
But all of the hurdles that fell in our laps
Were fuel for the fire and straw for our backs
Still the voices have stories to tell
Of the power struggles in heaven and hell
But we feel secure against such mighty dreams
As Orpheus sings of the promise tomorrow may bring

Tell me, I've still a lot to learn
Understand, these fires never stop
Please believe, when this joke is tired of laughing
I will hear the promise of my Orpheus sing"

Here in my can
I can play the Last tape
Play  my small uke
Write stupid songs
Like this one

Haven't slept in days, but that's OK.
Gonna let 'er eat
Cat pizza road apples coffee shun Vivarin
Have a little snack
Put in a quarter and play road rally
Driving sown the dark corridor
Fall asleep and wake up in another place

Here in my can
I can hate everyone
Wait for no girls to call me in the middle of the night
Here in my van
I can lose my small mind"
89,The Monkees,Heart And Soul (LP Version),TRJQCXU128F4241969,1987,"Love in a vacuum, love in a space 
Love without even a little hint of a trace 
Love and confusion and love doesn't show on your face 

Love is a stranger, love is a box 
Love is the key that fits a million locks 
Love is a mystery, when love is the devil you go 

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 

Love at a distance, love at a walk 
Love is the limit if only people could talk 
Love for the moment it takes two it swings like a hold 

Love for tomorrow, love for today 
Love for the hour it could be comin' your way 
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play 

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine 

I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine 

I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine 
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine"

Don't ask me when I'm coming back again
I reckon it's only a matter of time
Before the law kick in the door
Mother I'm running out of change,
but I had to phone to let you know

They'll never take me alive
They'll never take me alive

Mother I killed someone
It wasn't that I hated him
You see, he was trying to stop me
But he found out
I've gone the whole way

They'll never take me alive

wherever my inquisitive heart
wants to lead me to
i will follow no matter how far
i can't leave these thoughts behind me
they catch my every breath
they turn me into someone
that i haven't met yet

I wish you were here
here in england
the weather is fine
here in england
and i wish you were here

Missing you is easy
it's all i can do
and wishing you were with me
its a pointless wish to choose
it's my heart thats feels abandoned
it's the heart that takes the strain
it all seems so hopeless
but i love you just the same
I wish .."
93,Pulp,They Suffocate At Night,TRBSSYS128F92E87D6,1987,"His body loved her
his mind was set on other things
Keep your face out of sight 
and your thoughts to yourself
And this went on for several nights
festering in silence, growing in the dark 

and this they saw as love
Love
So sad to see
They suffocate at night
Oh this they saw as love
Love
So sad to see
to see it slowly die

She met his wishes
he found that he had changed his mind
Now the fit is too tight
and the bedroom too warm
The days are filled with things to do 
Night-time lies so hollow and memories betray

Oh memories of love
Love 
So sad to see 
They suffocate at night
Those memories of love
Love 
So sad to see 
to see it slowly die

Two years have passed
two years of emptiness inside
and the grey skies above 
just show how far I went wrong
I wonder if she's living there 
the way that I recall
the way I'll always think of you
And when I think of you

I think of love 
Love
So sad to see 
They suffocate at night
You know I think of love
Love
So sad to see
to see it slowly die

I threw it away
I wrote you a letter
I threw it away
I need her 
I know I don't need her 
I need her
Oh

I'm beggin' you, friend, don't take her, she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I wanna live 
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need to drink
She's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
Let me tell you now, friend...

She's my fingers when I want to feel
She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
She is love, she's all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make the flower grow
Let me tell you now, friend..."

Know that you'll be the only one

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life.

In a lifetime
There is only love
Reaching for the lonely one
We are stronger when we are given love
When we put emotions on the line
Know that we are the timeless ones

Swept on for ever to be lost in the stormy sea

Where the roarin' waters fall wail-a-ree

Whisper low in my ear 
Let knows how it feels 
Just to know you are near 

Your body gives me a thrill 
As it leans against mine 
I love how it feels 
With your jeans against mine 

The smell of burning leather 
As we hold each other tight 
As our rivets rub together 
Flashing sparks into the night 
At this moment of surrender darling 
If you really care 
Don't touch me there 

Unzip that jacket 
That leather smells so sweet 
Put your chest against mine 
Feel my heart beat 

I love the way your belt fits 
The way it hangs so low 
So low on your hips my darling 
I want you so 

I love your sweet, sweet lips 
I love your salty taste 
I love your finger tips 
When I reach for your waist?! Uh-huh... 

The smell of burning leather 
As we hold each other tight 
As our rivets rub together 
Flashing sparks into the night 
At this moment of surrender darling 
If you really care 
Don't touch me there 

I will give my love forever 
If you promise me you'll 
Never never never touch me there 
Don't touch me there 

Don't touch me there 
Please don't 
Don't touch me there 
Oh no not there 
Don't touch me there

In a [D] horsedrawn carriage on the [G] old A-[Am]-5
[Am] The big twelve wheeler shook my bed, 
You [D] can't stay [Am] here the po-[D]-liceman [Em] said.

CHORUS
You'd [Am] better get [G] born in [D] some place [Em] else.
So [Am] move along  [Em] get along  
[Am] move along  [Em] get along,
[F] Go   [G] Move  [Am] Shift!

Born in the common by a building site
Where the ground was rutted by the trail of wheels
The local Christian said to me, 
""You'll lower the price of property.""

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

Born at potato picking time
In a noble tent in a tatie field.
The farmer said, ""The work's all done
It's time that you was moving on.""

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

Born at the back of a hawthorn hedge
Where the black hole frost lay on the ground.
No eastern kings came bearing gifts.
Instead the order came to shift.

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

The eastern sky was full of stars
And one shone brighter than the rest 
The wise men came so stern and strict
And brought the orders to evict

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

Wagon, tent or trailer born,
Last month, last year or in far off days.
Born here or a thousand miles away
There‚s always men nearby who'll say

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

The sleeve notes from 'Live at the Point""
has two extra verses (added by Christy)

Six in the morning out in Inchicore
The guards came through the wagon door.
John Maughan was arrested in the cold
A travelling boy just ten years old.

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!

Mary Joyce was living at the side of the road
No halting place and no fixed abode.
The vigilantes came to the Darndale site
And they shot her son in the middle of the night.

You'd better get born in some place else.
So move along, get along, Move along, get along,
Go! Move! Shift!"

Seul comme un caillou, sans conscience. Lui. Il n'y a que lui, son monde, sa seule vérité.
Raciste, comme un délirium tremens.
Jacky va tuer au hasard comme on jette une bouteille, comme on écrase un insecte, comme on éclate une bulle dans les emballages plastique, il va tuer sans le vouloir comme un assassin médiocre, comme un enfant, conditionné, avec ce rire de dément et même pas de honte, parce qu'il est faible, incroyable immaturé, vengeur, se venger de n'être rien. Jaloux de n'être rien. Haineux de sa condition.
Amour propre sale, fierté grotesque, morgue imbécile, orgueuil mal mis, dans les banlieues de lapins, périphéries manipulées, provinces balayées par les revers du mépris, macadam noir, et pauvreté microbienne....
Consommateur consommé. La cervelle gobée. Dans les grandes tentacules du pouvoir, infernales machinations protectionistes et peuple ridiculisé qui se mange lui même, comme les rats qui se suicident...."" 

From the other side ( Jacky 1)

Colier dent de requin
Paumettes saillantes
Des signes dans le dos

Hamburger,chewing gum
Il tord des petites cuillères
Un couteau dans la poche

Il passe sa vie dehors 
Comme une bête sauvage
De l'essence dans les veines

Il s'fout du nucléaire 
Et puis des écolos, 
Les pieds sous sa dégaine

Il se fait des copains le temps d'une échappée
Il passe des nuits à boire
Et pisser et reboire

Il vante les fantômes de la terreur 
Ou les stars du malaise
En écoutant du hard à fond les manettes

Affalé comme un paquet de chiffons 
Il se saoûle, il se bourre, il se casse
Il sait pas quand il rentre 

Il s'engueule dans la rue 
Et la fille en veut plus
Elle appelle au secours, ya des vieux aux fenêtres

Il la cogne 
Et il se barre 
Il lui laisse un cocard

Il renverse les poubelles 
Il a pas peur de la mort 
Ni des coups de savattes 

Il a pas peur du froid 
Comme un employé d' bureau 
Peut redouter le moindre courant d'air

Il péte comme un percheron il rigole mais ça pue
Il vole des packs de bière 
Qu'il boit dans sa tanière

Y a des gouttières quand il pleut,
Ya des mois dans l'évier 
Du moisi dans les tasses

Il croit qu'tout l'monde est riche 
Et qu'y a qu'lui qui n'a rien
Il dit qu'les seuls mecs bien c'est les américains 

Il a pas connu la guerre
Il a vu que les films
Il voulait être fort comme un dessin de B.D.

Il se prend pour un dieu
Il dit qu'il aurait pu être un champion 
Si on l'avait aidé

Il dit qu'il ne trouve pas de boulot
Surtout pas faire d'effort,
Pour qui, pour quoi

Il aimait pas son père 
Il aimait pas sa mère
Il n'aime personne

Il dit qu'il ne peut rien faire de bon
Sauf peut être gigolo 
Il sait pas c'qu'il lui faut 

Il voulait qu'on l'adore mais tout l'monde en est là
Alors il se fout de tout
Comme tout l'monde se fout de lui.

Jacky 

Avec ses yeux de fauve 
Et son tatouage sur l'épaule
Le blouson ouvert même en hiver
Jacky aurait fait n'importe quoi
Pour qu'on parle de lui

Pas plus salaud qu'un autre looser
Mais paumé dans son incognito
Jacky s'croyait un héros 
Mais c'est juste un fait divers

Refrain: Jacky trainait, trainait
Jacky trainait encore
Pis s'est r'trouvé dans un train
Porté par son destin

Et il buvait de la bière
Oui, Jacky buvait beaucoup de bière
Jacky draguait dans la rue
Mais Jacky était fier

Savait pas c'qu'il voulait
Jacky se foutait de tout
Il subissait sa vie
Comme un grand refus

Refrain

Ce jour là 
Sur son lit
Il regardait le plafond

La peinture 
Qui faisait des cloques
Jacky regardait le vide

Il tirait sur sa clope
En bourrant la fumée
Bien au fons des poumons

Il disait j'ai pas peur du cancer peur de rien
Alors il s'est engagé
Et il apris ce train

A genoux, dans les waters
Maint'nant il dégueule son enfer
Complètement inconscient
Il a balancé un innocent

Comme tous ceux qui vivent
En se croyant quelqu'un d'autre
Il s'est retrouvé coupable
De n'être que lui-même

Refrain

Comme tous ceux qui vivent
En se croyant quelqu'un d'autre
Il s'est retrouvé coupable
De n'être que lui-même

Every bound and ban cuts like a knife
She's willing to break down the walls
When the night-time falls
Blue moonlight, she's wide awake
Every breath of the dark makes her shake
In silence she's slipping away on a moonlight's ray

Hot night, there's loving and spite
In the lanes and in the alleys, darkness and light
Hot night, the good and bad's so close together

The Beauty and the Beast, saints and demons--kisses and bites
The Beauty and the Beast in the dead of the night

He's longing, longing to stray
Leaving back all the yesterday's clay
Right down where the streets have no names
The winds were never tamed
Together they're taking to flight
Hand in hand through the maze of the night
Don't follow the Will-o'-the-wisp in the shadow's mist

Hot night, there's loving. . .

He isn't much at a dance but then when he takes you home, 
you'd be surprised.
He doesn't look like much of a lover,
don't judge a book by its cover,
'cause he's got the face of an angel but
there's a devil in his eye!
He's such a delicate thing but when he's starting to squeeze, 
you'd be surprised.
He doesn't look very strong but when you sit on his knee,
you'd be surprised.
At a party or at a ball, 
I've got to admit he's nothing at all,
but in a Morris chair, you'd be surprised.
He doesn't say very much but when he's starting to speak, 
you'd be surprised.
He's not so good at the start but at the end of the week, 
you'd be surprised.
On a streetcar or in a train, 
you'd think he was born without any brains.
But in a taxi cab, and when he starts to grab,
I say in a taxi cab, you'd be surprised.

The love has gone, will we ever be the same
The feelings wrong, the joy has turned to pain

Wake up beside you, and hear you breathing
And I can feel you in my arms
No one can know just how I'm feeling
Knowing that our love can come to no harm

But as I open my eyes
Then I start to realise
That you're gone and I can't go on

The love has gone, will we ever be the same
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain
The love is gone, will we ever be the same
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain

What have I done girl, to make you leave me
Didn't I love you for all those years

If you open your eyes
Baby, then you'll realise
That you're wrong, and I can't go on
You know I can't go on

The love has gone, will we ever be the same
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain
The love is gone, will we ever be the same
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain

Nothing will ever come between us
If you will just take me back once more
I'll show you just how much I love you
If you'll just come walking through that door

The love has gone, will we ever be the same
The feeling's wrong, the joy has turned to pain
The love is gone, will we ever be the same

Of paper houses
A price is paid
For information
It's too late
Your fate is sealed
And there's nothing you can do
You can't hide in the shadows
There'll be someone playing

Chinese whispers
Spy versus spy
Chinese whispers black and white lies

There are two sides
To every story
But who decides
Which one is safer?
You can't see
Behind closed doors
So who do you believe…
When you're trapped in the shadows
There'll be someone playing

Zoom lenses seek sensation
Money talks
Under investigation
Don't dance with a stranger

The power lies
In words and pictures
To twist the truth
And shape the future
Suddenly…your time runs out
And there's nothing you can do
As you smile for the camera
There'll be someone playing

Chinese whispers…"

Pack a hundred people, ya know ya gonna need'em

Cause every half hour they get nine more
They run all dollars that come in town
Either join the crew or get beat down
I watched all the guys be so damn cruel
Try to get fast, you must be a fool
Blood through and through, the boys don't play
I seen'em tax and run an operation today
They had too, too, too much posse

Yeah, I had a party, much people came by
I'm talking to a 'g' cause the 'g' real fly
Chillin’ in my room, chewin' off her ear
Chillin' stupid fly cause I got stupid gear
My door kicked open by her man and crew
The 'g' turned turned to me and said, ""Who you?""
So I said, ""Yo fly, yeah the 'g' lied""
Stuck in the corner while the 'g' cried
And then from the back, my homeboys came
Their uzis and nines and said “don’t blame”
Ya lying ass girl with the fake tears
We got a big posse and we show no fears
We got too, too, too much posse

119,Artie Shaw and his orchestra,Begin The Beguine,TROIYZU128F932DF33,1987,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more
""Darling, I love you""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in
When they begin the beguine"

Why must you kill them to secure their vote

And all of your people lie dead

Taken by force
Controlled by fear

If the Aurora Bridge fell down?

If the Gas Works Park stayed closed

If Georgio's turned into a fast-food joint
The price of martinis would sky-rocket out of sight

When all the world is sleep
I watch you as you toss and turn
And pray my soul you'll keep
I sense you are afraid
That I'm not holding fast
But you are just nervous
And I'm certain that this too will pass

I don't ask for your honey
All I want is love

Our dedication wanders
You're hurt from what you hear
But then the rain falls down
And wipes away your tears
The stars are everlasting
But even they shift from time to time
If we just slow down
Catch our breath
We'll be fine

Let's go forward with our love
I don't ask for your wallet
Let's finish what we started
All I need is love

And gold turns into green
Giving my love back
Would tear away our seed
Like real silver and gold
We can keep our vows

Until the killing ground

But now you run from me
And I will set you free
If that's the way it must be.

I tried so hard to make you part of me
That every time I looked at you
I thought I'd see
Someone that you could never ever be.
So full of pride that I could not see straight
I thought you'd change
If I could only wait
I see the truth now but it's much too late
Cause now you run from me
And I will set you free
If that's the way it must be.

Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean
Oh--oh. Is there nothing left but silence in between.
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean

Cada golpe de verdad
Cada vez estoy más lejos

No me importa cuántos van
Ya no sé ni dónde vivo
Ya no sé dónde parar
Empecé a moverme un poco
No es cuestión de estar tan mal
Lo que no puedo explicarme ya lo voy a transpirar
Que se queden con sus cosas
Que se queden ahí atrás
Que se queden con su mundo

Volviendo a vos creo que lo que
Mejor sería es cambiar de tema

come ease my mind

For my prayers have not been
answered in a long time.

I've already made my bed
like it or not

As long as there's no
regrets I'll be here

These comforts to me and
these crosses to bare

Shining through the layers of static in your brain
You always know it when you're tuned in to the good one
It's pure and clear
So when the media barons program their pollution
Your new transmissions will just neutralise their rays
I see us radiating with the radio of freedom
And linking up our hearts and minds again

Something new begins to grow
A living crystal radio
A-powering your dynamo
You tune your inner radio"

I paint the sheets across my bed
The birds will all fly from my head
And in the morning I'll be gone

Find every boot that's leaving
Shoot all the lights in the cafe

800 pounds of nitro
His boots are thunder as he plays
 
Theree is a stone inside it
Tonight his bones will ride it
I'll need a tent to hide it
And in the morning I'll be gone
And in the morning I'll be gone
And in the morning I'll be gone

And there ain't nothing to stop you now
But you rolled around like a squeaky wheel
'Til she bit the spurs right off your heel

She was fine 'til you made her mean
She couldn't fit in your two-toned dream
All you do is beg and plead
You ask for water but she gave you gasoline

Say please
Say please
Say please (say please... say)

You got your name written on your shirt
It's Mr. Look-At-Me-I'm-Hurt
You better drop that sorry scheme,
Close your eyes and get down on your knees

Say please

Please!"

But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road
A little scared, but I know where to go
Cuz I know the road
I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road

Hold on--a fork in the road
Life in transition
Hold on--moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on--gotta feel the road
Know my position

Break the speakers, crack the books
Over you shoulder, not another look
Burn off the shackles of a wooden past
Melt through the ice, be free at last
Dare to be stupid, dare to smell
You can be crazy, you can be hell
The end result is always the same
Whichever you choose, you lose--you're insane

Granite poured into my veins
Black hole explodes in my brain
The accident is to blame
You say you're going insane
Say it like you mean it, man
I wish I could, but I can't
You say that life is a pain
It isn't for me, man
I don't feel anything at all

Shield myself from the world
Hold everything inside
Fold my arms across my chest
Shield the world from myself
Make sure the sleeves are tied
Wrap my arms across my chest
Death is my life
Life is my Death
Lay my arms across my chest

I know the road, I know where it goes
Don't tell me what I already know
I know where it goes, that's why I'm going so slow"

when I came out of the movies deep in the night
And no Mack-the-knife was waiting 'round the corner, in the dark
No one asked me for money, no one made a remark
It was a warm and velvet midnight
I whistled my favourite song
The street lay blue in the moonlight,
but I couldn't help feeling
that something was wrong

There was a feeling, something was different
As if someone had put a spell on this night
The trees they whispered sweet nothings, a dog was barking somewhere
There was a kind of tension, an electric smell in the air,
but I didn't step into dogshit
I whistled my favourite song
I hit the street in the moonlight
Though I couldn't help feeling
that something was wrong

I heard nothing but the sound of my footsteps
and the answer came over me when I got home
I was alone there, no one waiting, no one would call in the night
No one would whisper sweet nothings, and no one would hold me tight
It was a springtime without you
Nothing else could be wrong
It was springtime, I was lonely,
and the song I had whistled:
It was a lovesong"

It's making lines across your face

Turn your cheek, get over it

Deceive yourself about your best
Come to find you've failed the test

Nyt on poltettu jo viimeinenkin silta
Äiti lapsellensa toivoo keppeet mullat

Oisi pitänyt se tappaa hirsipuussa
Anna tytärtänsä lohduttaa ja silmät pyyhkii
Tekee pyöryköille isoäidin soosin
Uskoo elämää ja varkain hetken nyyhkii

Itkee Maria mut mummu, hän vain häärää
Hän on vittuuntunut alituisiin sotiin

I could leave you never

Every time I look at you

Anyone with half a heart
Could never let you go

I think about losing
The only girl I ever loved
Can't you tell me why do you hurt me
I guess some people never see
Especially a fool like me

Pero el fin del verano es triste,
aun cuando sabemos que todo es un ciclo
y llegará el día en que sudando
desearemos otra vez el frío enero

El fin, el fin del verano

Es el momento de la lluvia,
las hojas muertas color ocre,
la hora del sueño del lagarto
el fin del verano es triste, querámoslo o no
Lejos de los ojos guardaremos la piel

El fin del verano siempre es triste,
aunque entre las mantas pueda hablar de amor.

I've stepped beyond the law divine and gone beyond limits set, prescribed
I live to take don't tread behind intact I'm not and I'm mindless blind

The change takes place the sights are set enter my lair and live to regret
My lair's a cage impregnable you'll bet a hungry mind is my victim's net
My guilt is innocence from which you'll bet
To it you're drawn from you it grows on me a turned table is your worst enemy
The fact you are in truth you will not be

Place of torment my final rest I'll know
Before I'm through my flames will rise to show

I see your face just a-smilin' there

Unseen but there, death in the air

Atmospheric genocide, annihilation, millions die

There is no method that is foolproof

Mulher que se atrasa, mulher que vai na frente
Mulher dona-de-casa, mulher pra presidente

Peito pra dar de mamar
E peito só pra enfeitar

Mas eu sei lá, nem quero saber,
eu gosto de mulher, eu gosto de mulher

eu gosto é de mulher

Nem quero que você me leve a mal
Eu sei que hoje em dia isso nem é normal
Eu sou assim meio atrasadão
Conservador, reacionário e caretão
Pra que ser diferente
Se eu fico sem mulher eu fico até doente
Mulher que lava roupa, mulher que guia carro
Mulher que tira a roupa, mulher pra tirar sarro

Mulher eu já provei
Eu sei que é bom demais, agora o resto eu não sei
Sei que eu não vou mudar
Sei que eu não vou nem tentar
Desculpe esse meu defeito

Poles lie twisted in the ruins of Warsaw's shattered
line
The Wermacht's strength has left it's mark with
lightning speed and power
The West responds uneasily to face another war
The Axis lords plan their assults for their territory
gains

From frozen arctic wastes the battle rages in it's
fury
To blazing desert sands the land is overrun with blood
On land and sea in the air the swords of nations clash
The West is stabbed with a vicious blow and writhes in
agony

endless plains

Oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man
Yo we got to dust these boys off

[Chuck D]
In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers object of hate
Who's the one some think is great
I'm that one (son of a gun)
Driving by waving my fist
Making 'em mad when I'm going like this
Top gun, never on the run
(They know not to come cause they all get some)
Going quicker in the speeding lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causing them pain
Caught in my smoke, all they did was choke
Look at my spokes, you know I'm no joke
Out that window, middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
(To talk about the car when they're walking tall)

Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
You're gonna get yours 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
You're gonna get yours

[Chuck D]
Pulling away every day
Leaving you in the dust so you know I get paid
On the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailing on my tip
Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seeing no comp coming like I'm blind
All left back trailing my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let it go, my turbo
Run 'em in the river cause they're moving too slow
Laughing hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charges me contempt
I'll rub my boomerang cause I'm feeling proud
And I wouldn't even hear 'em cause my radio's loud

Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
You're gonna get yours 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
You're gonna get yours

Cruising down the boulevard
I'm treated like some superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
(Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car)
All you suckers in the other rides
Wherever I'm coming get to my side
My 98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail better watch your face
Smoke is coming when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows, so super bad
Looking like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My 98 Olds blows 'em all away

My 98 Oldsmobile is (Su-Su-Su)
My 98 Oldsmobile's so (Su-Su-Su)
My 98 Oldsmobile is (Su-Su-Su)

Understand, I don't drive drunk
My 98's fly, I don't drive no junk
No cop got a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket, go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick but line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't even know what's happening, what's up
Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took the girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside, got in my ride
Drove them around and I looked around town
Caught 'em out there cold, ran 'em over and down
They didn't get me and that's the truth
(Cause my 98-O is bullet proof)

My 98 Oldsmobile's so (Su-Su-Su)
My 98 Oldsmobile is (Su-Su-Su)

I want rest and relaxation
Don't wanna go out and see the streets
Sightseeing really bites

Marvel at the land formations
And the antique restorations
I don't care what happened here
Rather sit back and drink a beer than 

Walk around in Bermuda shorts
Stay in overpriced resorts
And buy some stupid souveniers

Stop off at a place of interest
Walk around and take some pictures
Stroll around like a jerk
Sightseeing's for the birds

Driving around on a crowded bus
With smelly people really sucks

You wore down my resistance:

No glow, no real signs, but we both know
This is all for show

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We could show the world we have each other
Sometime, somewhere we need not hide out feelings,
We just keep on believing that we both have the time together
Sometime and somewhere,our lips would be free at last
You say the words we've hungered to say

And we won't have to worry, we smile we won't say sorry
One look and we have cast our fears aside.
Sometime, that sometime will turn to forever, for all time.
Somewhere, our somewhere would not be just one place,
But everywhere

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We just have to be content with stealing glances
Somehow, content with saying nothing, smiles that are
Always wanting. Though deep inside it hurts
Because we know that our love, like love,
Is what it is, it's what we got
Our love, like love will have to wait

Surround my bed
That from which they sprung - eternity

Beneath the turf
The silent dead

Sleep brings no wish to knit
My harrassed heart beneath
My only wish is to forget
In the sleep of death
Death is my joy
I long to be at rest
I wish the damp earth covered
This desolate brest

Beneath the mould
The silent dead

But the glad eyes around us
Must weep as we have done
And we must see the same gloom
Eclipse their morning sun

Oh not for them - Should we despair
The grave is drear - But they're not there
Their dust is mingled - With the sod
Their pale souls - Are gone, to god

Well, may they live in ecstasy
Their long eternity of joy
At least I wouldn't bring them down
With me to weep, to groan
And what's the future
A sea beneath the cloudless sun
A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea
Stretching into infinity

di gente che si frantuma in un fiato
senza soffrire, senza capire
tra addormentarsi e morire.
ma che cosa c'e' in fondo a questa notte,
quando l'ora del lupo guaisce
e il nuovo giorno non arriva mai
e il buio e' un fischio lontano che non finisce;
di minuti lunghi come il sudore
di ore che tagliano come falci
e i tuoi pensieri solo un cane in chiesa
che tutti prendono a calci.

atrii a piastrelle di stazioni secondarie,
strade piu' strade di avventure solitarie,
clown della notte,
valigie vuote,
piene di trucchi per tragedie immaginarie...
telecomandi per i quotidiani inferni,
battute argute di architetti postmoderni,
amanti andate,
piaceri a rate,
pallottolieri per contare estati e inverni.
Ma cosa c'e' proprio in fondo in fondo,
quando bene o male faremo due conti,
e i giorni gocciolerannmo come i rubinetti nel buio
e diremo ""...un momento...aspetti..."" per non

And maybe someday man will see
That love is a lesson money never taught us to learn
Love is the power to have
Without the premise that there's nothing for free

And sometimes when we're just getting by and getting along
It's like we're scared to see that something is wrong

Why should it take (why should) the tears of a woman (the tears of a woman)
To see how men are (To see how men are)

Why should it take (why should) the tears of a woman (the tears of a woman)
To see how men are (To see how men are... To see how men are)

It's no mystery, s'no mystery (no mystery)

It's history
You better see

Unseen in the rain
This thing has turned into
A runaway train

Long-distance phone calls
A voice on the line
Electrical miles
That soften the time
The dynamite too
Is hooked on the wire
And so are the rails
Of American Flyers

Blind boys and gamblers
They invented the blues
Will pay up in blood
When this marker comes due
To try and get off now
It's about as insane
As those who wave lanterns
At runaway trains

Steel rails and hard lives
Are always in twos
I have been here before this
And now it's with you

I'm worried about you
I'm worried about me
We're lighting the fuses
And counting to three
And what are the choices
For those who remain
The sign of the cross
On a runaway train

A runaway train
This thing has turned into
A runaway train

Maybe I'm a dreamer
Or maybe I'm a fool
But I never thought
That love could be
So careless or so cruel.
You wrestle with the reasons
But the reasons never rhyme
Or comfort when the
Heart is in decline
And it doesn't really matter
If it's chance or it's design
It's going to take some time.

Love don't play no favorites
You know there's no one that's immune
Cause she changes her demeanor
Like the phases of the moon.
There ain't no easy answers
You know there's only shades of grey
But when it's love or it's survival
I guess you gotta get away.
The days stretch on forever
And the nights are so unkind
And endless when the
Heart is in decline.

And it doesn't really matter
If it's chance or it's design
It's going to take some time.
It's going to take some time."

A shame and disgrace for the human race

Du bist ein Mann dem man den Mann ansieht
Der stundenlang vorm Spiegel steht
Bist ein Versuch der süchtig macht
Wenn der Teufel sündig lacht
Dein Aussehn ist mein Schicksal, der Rest ist Energie
Nur ein einziges Wort und ich fall dir vor die Knie
Nur ein einziges Wort und ich fall dir
Ich fall dir vor die Knie

Du hast 'ne Ladung Dynamit
Wenn die losgeht flieg ich mit
'Ne Ladung Dynamit
Wenn die losgeht flieg ich mit

Bei dir hab ich Tausend Puls im Stand
Ich mix die Euphorie mit dem Rest Verstand
Schieß wie 'ne Rakete hoch ins Licht
Wie ein Vulkan, der ausbricht
Dein Aussehn ist mein Schicksal, der Rest ist Energie
Nur ein einziges Wort und ich fall dir vor die Knie
Nur ein einziges Wort und ich fall dir
Ich fall dir vor die Knie

Wenn die losgeht flieg ich mit"
203,The Hooters,Washington's Day,TRNJALO128F9306C26,1987,"Did you think I could ever forget 
The night by the arlington flame 
In the silence I heard it 
Through streets so deserted 
You whispered and called me by name 

Did you think I could ever forget 
That powerful look in your eye 
Where Lincoln stood strong there 
You held me so long there that night 
On the fourth of July 

I hope and I pray that you'll be here with me 
When the mountains that rise tumble into the sea 
And the kingdoms that come set us free on our way 
Hope you'll be here with me 
Home on Washington's day 

Now when this world and that world collide 
And the powers that be hit you low 
When you're feeling so small in the face of it all 
And you're lost on eternity row 

When the wars that men wage are all through 
And their monuments put on display 
Tell the hungry and stranded 
The poor empty handed 
We'll meet them on Washington's day 

I hope and I pray that you'll be here with me 
When the mountains that rise tumble into the sea 
And the kingdoms that come set us free on our way 
Hope you'll be here with me 
Home on Washington's day 

Did you think I could ever forget 
The night by the arlington flame 
Where the monuments laugh over thousands of years 
You whispered and called me by name 

And when the sun goes down 
At the end of the day 
You know I'll always remember 
You who were tender to me 
On Washington's day 

I hope and I pray that you'll be here with me 
When the mountains that rise tumble into the sea 
And the visions that come are the visions that stay 
Hope you'll be here with me 
Home on Washington's day"

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance"

Well well, it just ain't right

You say your prayers, though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland

Suggested walking for awhile
Thought it'd be dramatic if we walked all night
But I got tired, so I came home
Lay back on the couch to watch TV
The drunks were talking, wasn't long before I grew bored,
Lewis didn't feel the same
I guess they spoke in tongues that wrapped around his brain,
He didn't mind the feeling at all
Remember me sometime when I am far away
And I will try and do the same
Maybe just like you some day I will forget
Every hit song America ever had
Like this is for all the Lonely People,
And Oz never gave nothing to the Tin Man,
And I've been to a desert on a horse without a name"

To find all these things that you need?

Don't know how to begin

It was so right and so true
Now here I am and it's ending
Trying to find as it was to you

I don't know where to start it
Don't know how to begin
And I don't even cry anymore at night

So many tears

Someone is being so loveless
There's jealousy played its part
Brand new begin, but I don't understand
Trying purposely to break my heart

I don't know where it started
Don't know why it began
Was it my or something
Why did you make life so tough
Swore that I'd love you only
But it never seems to be enough

I don't even know where it started
Don't know why it began
And I don't even cry anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, so many tears
So many tears
So many tears

It's hard, so hard to watch you
Destroy what took so long to find
You say that you care about mine
Tell me when did you stop caring for mine

I hold on faithfully
Each night was always the same
My request must have gone on deaf ears
'Cause the answer never came and that's why

I don't even cry anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, are my tears
So many tears
So many tears (so many tears)

Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That there's only one thing left to say

Goodbye

She said ""I get it every night,
And he calls me everyday""
He'll leave you back and blue
He'll rip you right in two 
Then wake up in the morning and say
""Who the hell are you?""
And then she turned to me and said ""we know you
Tell us some secrets, honey, we won't say a word""

I know what I believe, don't need to wear it on my sleeve 
I talk to no one, I will say nothing

The boy who's always mad
He's just alone and sad 
He holds my hand so tightly he says
Go away I'm bad 
I'll leave you black and blue 
And I'll rip you right in two
But it is just because i do not
Know how to be true
That's why I sometimes stand alone at parties
That's why I drink so I'll be who they think I am

But don't say nothing, don't talk to no one
I'm not what they believe and if they find out they will leave 
Don't talk to no one, just don't say nothing
If we come and go alone why to they need to know

Arcades
All those endless days of all those sci-fi slaves
The noise was just a drag until you say close your eyes
And listen 
It's singing for you 
It's swinging just for you 
It's screaming just for you 

I'll say
Nothing
I'll talk to
No one

There is a place somewhere 
Sometimes you'll find me there 
If i am alone i will be sitting on the stairs 
i'll be good as new
one of the lonely few 
who's laughing at the joke and as i leave i laugh for you 

But I say nothing, I talk to no one
I know what I believe, don't need to wear it on my sleeve 
I talk to no one, I will say nothing 
If we come and go alone then what's the point of crying 'bout arcades?

And there ain't a lizard in sight

In the home of the brave?

Where the remnant warn
Of a legend born
In a dead man's cave

I can't shut my eyes, I'm a fraid of the Dark
I lie awake
That stone left me chilled to the bone
Sound the alarm before it's done
Find Jim Morrision
Come away to Paris
Let him see another day
Let him fade out slowly
Only fools burn away
Let a true love show him what a heart can become
Somebody find Jim Morrison
Find Jim Morrison's Grave

reina de la morería
toíto el pueblo la adoraba
y le rezaba noche y día
porque la reina Samara
con su cara tan gitana
una Virgen parecía
ay Samara, reina de la morería

que me quitara estas fatigas

Bastante más que enviar cupones a la tele,
Más que planchar tus bluyines,
Más que pelear por un sueldo decente a cada fin de mes.

Hay gente que está comiendo de tu 'no saber qué decir',
Su fuerza es la ignorancia de todos nosotros.
Vampiros que suponen que somos felices con sobrevivir,
Y se aseguran que todo siga así.

Queremos elegir, decidir,
Debemos elegir cómo quieres vivir,
Reclamar y pelear, obligar y dejar de llorar,
Y que nadie aproveche de ti,
Y que nadie aproveche de ti.

Es tan difícil, yo sé que hay tanto miedo y frustración,
Ellos se ríen de todas las caras.
Unas gotas de sangre a cambio de mil toneladas,
Y sólo cantar canciones.

Queremos elegir, decidir,
Debemos elegir cómo quieres vivir,
Reclamar y pelear, y gritar y dejar de llorar,
Y que nadie aproveche de ti,
Y que nadie aproveche de ti.

""Su poder es nuestra ignorancia""."

I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey Baby, do as you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""

She's touching me so to start
She says, ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan 
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promised fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you'll make me a star""

'Cause I'm real tired you see
Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said, ""My Baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright""

Diana walked up to me,
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight.""
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', ""Baby I'm alright""
I said, ""But unlock the door
Because I forgot the key""

As the truth of it begins to become planted 
These two words have now become my heartfelt prayer

With a strong and honest wish 
To be the best that I can be at what I am 
Without a thought for me

There's a strange lady in town.
Who is this heart-stealin' stranger?
Who is turnin' the town upside down. 

Here hair is red as the settin' sun.
Her lips are ripe as the corn.
The lights that rise in her sea-green eyes,
Make a man kinda glad he was born. 

Strange lady in town, strange lady in town.
She's all that any man could ever hope or pray for.
If I were king, I'd trade the crown,
For that strange, strange lady in town.

And I can't buy her a gown.

Time only knows the price we have to pay;
If I could tell you I would let you know.

If we should weep when clowns put on their show,
If we should stumble when musicians play,
Time will say nothing but I told you so.

There are no fortunes to be told, although,
Because I love you more than I can say,
If I could tell you I would let you know.

The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,
There must be reasons why the leavers decay;
Time will say nothing but I told you so.

Perhaps the roses really want to grow,
The vision seriously intends to stay;
If I could tell you I would let you know.

Suppose the lions all get up and go,
And all the brooks and soldiers run away;
Will time say nothing but I told you so?
If I could tell you I would let you know."

I was rockin at a bar called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot 
Didn't know that years later I'll be standin on top 
Livin on Farmers Boulevard I was born at Bayshore
Slap the rich and shake hands with the poor 
And this is a story about a brother I know

I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin and prayin one day I'd get on a roll
So I'd have Fila in the summer and a mink when it's cold
Not fearin of course, cockstrong like a horse 
No man's runnin my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his homie can't wait to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind

My headlights lit her body by some pine trees on a bend
I slowed down right beside her
I turned the music down
She looked around then climbed inside
She didn't make a sound

Evangeline!

Well, soon we started talking
I asked her for her name
She said it's not important but I'll tell you anyway
My Mother loved the bayou
My Daddy worked the land
They named me after what they loved
So the world would understand

Evangeline!

We stopped just past the crossroads
She thanked me once again
I didn't wanna leave her but I drove on just the same
I thought about her story
Words whispered from her mouth
Her beauty and her innocence a credit to the South

Evangeline!

I could not believe, she was gone when I returned
The forest's evening chorus was the only sound I heard
Now if you ever see her,
Be sure to say hello
Her levelled thumb may stop you if you're Westbound and alone

to act like a woman should.
If he's late and I'm alone and he doesn't telephone
and the kiss that greets him says ""I understood"",
then I act like a woman and he likes a woman
to act like a woman should.
And if I keep that lovelight shining in my eyes
though I'm hurt by something he may say,
it doesn't take him very long to realize
that it's more than just devotion that makes me act that way.
And as years go passing by, if I still can catch his eye

Committed to be free....

A common bound in freedom and in sound!
So raise your voices high
For miles around to hear
Let them know we are drawing nearer

In union, we stand
As they blaze across the land!
In union, we make a final stand

A peaceful coexistence
Is dropping out of sight 
So band together
Together, we will fight

Blasting the resistance
Marching to the top
They started this—
We say when it stops

Strike fear within their hearts 
Strike down those in your way 
Let them know that we live today!

Thinking of a master plan
‘Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I...start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money; I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

I used to roll up…roll up…roll up

I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nutin’ move but the money
But now I learned to earn ‘cause I'm righteous
I feel great; so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place ‘cause, man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
‘Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, ‘cause I'm paid in full

One…two…three…Uhh
One…two…three…Uhh

(Bicho…even landen gruben)
(Pump up the volume, Pump up the volume)
(Pump that bass)

Im nin'alu

Daltei marom
Lo nin'alu
El Chai, mareimawm

(Back in the club)
(Why you kids used to laugh at that song)

Check this out
Yo, you go to your girl house and I’ll go to mine
‘Cause my girl is definitely mad cause it took us to long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you saying so let’s just pump the music up…
And count our money
Yo well check this out, Yo Eli
Turn the bass down and just let the beat keep on rocking
And we outta here

Pump up the volume, Pump up the volume
(Wait a minute; you better talk to my mother)

Im nin'alu

And rolled the liar's dice

Or leave me in the lurch
Now would you ever hurt me baby
Or leave me in the lurch
Do dogs chase after passing cars
Do Nuns kneel down in church

Rip it up

There's a message from my baby
Lipstick on the fridge
There's a message from my baby
Lipstick on the fridge
It says James don't wait up for me
Ah take it to the bridge
And drop it in the water

When I call I call your name
Your not there your still to blame
When your gone I feel the shame
When I call I call your name
Your not there your still to blame
When your gone I feel the shame

For an educated tongue
You always had a soft spot baby
For an educated tounge

Could've been my Pygmalion"

Well all those nights they hit rock bottom 
The songs they sang, well, we forgot 'em 
You could hear them play with shaky hands 
guitars strung up with rubber bands 
Singing do you want a man of steel? 
or do you want a man that's real 
They used to play in the courts of kings 
Now they're only made of steel when they're 
on Steel Strings 
They used to be on every schoolgirl's wall 
and they never dropped the beat at all 
They could make it soar, they could make it hot 
Once they got started they could never stop 
Singing, do you want a man of steel or 
Do you want a man that's real? 
Some of them hide when the doorbell rings 
They're only made of steel when they're on steel strings 
playing the man on steel strings 
Were you expecting maybe Superman? 
The best they do is the best they can 
The manager's doing time in jail (applause) 
And the pink Cadillac is up for sale 
Singing do you want a man of steel 
or do you want a man that's real 
They try their hands at a thousand things 
but they're only made of steel 
when they're on steel strings"

The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the mornin' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

He was like no cadet they'd ever seen
A man so hard, his veins bleed ice
And when he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge, his last name is Dredd
So break the law, and you'll wind up dead
Truth and justice are what he's fighting for
Judge Dredd the man, he is the law
Drokk it!

With gun and bike he rules the streets
And every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death can overcome his might
'Cause Dredd and Anderson, they won the fight
When the Sovs started the Apocalypse war
Mega-City was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted, and the Judges fought back
Crushed the Sovs with their counter-attack
Drokk it!

He earned it with his blood
Fear the gun

I am the law!
And you won't fuck around no more (I am the law!)
I judge the rich, I judge the poor (I am the law!)
Commit a crime, I'll lock the door (I am the law!)
Because in Mega-City, I am the law!

In the Cursed Earth where mutants dwell
There is no law, just a living hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
But this would change if it was up to Dredd
The Book of Law is the bible to him
And any crime committed is a sin
He keeps the peace with his Lawgiver
Judge, jury, and executioner

And all I see is grey
I'm watching the clouds roll by every day
And we make a reservation
You say you'll be on time
I say, ""I might be a little late""

Well, I pull it together and brush my teeth
And comb my hair
I stop to think and I can see you there
I think of the times you've waited
Just for me to care
I care about you 

Checking the clock inside
The room we call our own
I see that I'm late, I should be going
Hop on a local transit
Spending all my change
And I can still hear the telephone

I wanna go back, but I'm halfway to
The place where we will meet
And I'm half dead on my feet
And once I get there, I see
Everything's the same
Here comes the rain
You left me standing

I should have guessed that you'd stand me up
Why did I even go, now
And I guess it goes to show
The snow may well thaw out
But it goes right down the drain
You left me
You left me
You left me
You left me
You left me standing in the rain"

So my arms reach out to you for love

If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me.

And mysteries that sleep safe inside

His towers of stone
Shall not be overthrown
For eternity
They are guarded by the king
Insanity and the power that it brings

Come with me
Stay close by my side
As the darkness of night closes in
Don't fear
In the thunder, it roars

think they will do it.

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll meet along the way
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare
What will we find when we get there

La Sagrada Familia - we pray the storm will soon be over
La Sagrada Familia - for the lion and the lamb

Who knows where the winds may blow us, only a fool would say
Who knows if we'll ever reach the shore
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare
What kind of fire will burn us there? What kind of fire?
Oh, only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia - the wind has changed the storm is over
La Sagrada Familia - for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia - we thank the lord the danger's over
La Sagrada Familia - there's peace throughout the land

Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Filled with tears

Who knows where the world may turn us, only a fool would say
Who knows what the fates may have in store
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see
How should we know where that may be? (Where that may be)
How should we know? (How should we know)

Then the angry skies, the battle cries, the sounds of glory
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears
Filled with tears

Who knows where the road may lead us, only a fool would say
Who knows what's been lost along the way
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share
How will we know when we are there? (When we are there)
How will we know? (How will we know)
Only a fool would say

La Sagrada Familia the war is won the battle's over
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the danger's over

y ando como un gato en celo
patrullando la ciudad
en busca de una gatita,
a esa hora maldita
en que los bares a punto están de cerrar,
cuando el alma necesita
un cuerpo que acariciar. 
Algunas veces vivo
y otras veces 
la vida se me va con lo que escribo;
algunas veces busco un adjetivo
inspirado y posesivo 
que te arañe el corazón;
luego arrojo mi mensaje,
se lo lleva de equipaje
una botella..., al mar de tu incomprensión.
No quiero hacerte chantaje,


sólo quiero regalarte una canción. 
Y algunas veces suelo recostar 
mi cabeza en el hombro de la luna 
y le hablo de esa amante inoportuna 
que se llama soledad. 
Algunas veces gano
y otras veces 
pongo un circo y me crecen los enanos; 
algunas veces doy con un gusano 
en la fruta del manzano 
prohibido del padre Adán; 
o duermo y dejo la puerta 
de mi habitación abierta 
por si acaso se te ocurre regresar; 
más raro fue aquel verano 
que no paró de nevar. 
Y algunas veces suelo recostar 
mi cabeza en el hombro de la luna 
y le hablo de esa amante inoportuna 
que se llama soledad."

You fi learn all your roots if you don't know them already

With an open heart you would see clearly

While some gone a graveyard to catch some sleep

And it makes it even worst if you ???
Ten times worst if you ???

A seed-bed of so - so

Seen local farmers
In their big red pick-up trucks
Seen drug - store cowboys
Who could not find the range
Seen pet - boys in the city
Who need a love so strange

And I stood for the toast
Seen those screenplay writers
In their big homes on the coast
Stood in cathedrals
And breathed hard at the sight

Any find of problem before you

Life is not as long as you think
Open up your mind and you'll see
Don't destroy yourself I implore you

You've got a fine wife, a perfect family
You had it all planned to live so carefully
But where does it get you

They say the mind is an awful thing to waste
And that's a fact that you must come to face
What more can I tell you?

I don't want to harp about it

And realize it's all waiting for you

And leave the world we used to know

Those days of me and you
Now we know that breaking up

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Cruised into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe you're wrong, but you know it's alright
That's right

Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody say
Forgive me if I seem out of line
Then she whipped out her gun and tried to blow me away

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

So never judge a book by its cover
Or who you're gonna love by your lover
Love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

(Baby let me follow you down) Let me take a peek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me all night
(Baby let me follow you down) Turn the other cheek dear
(Baby let me follow you down) Do me, do me, do me, do me

Ooh what a funky lady
She like it, like it, like it, like that
Ooh he was a lady

The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You'll always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall

You'll always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall
So if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all

292,Guadalcanal Diary,Lips Of Steel (LP Version),TRLHFWI128F423279E,1987,"Close tomorrow's eyes upon awakening
Blinded when the sun gets in the way
Brush away a drop of rain still hanging
Kiss the lips of steel that turn away

Reach to catch a dream that leaves you waiting
Listen to the metal heart that beats
Can you feel the cold eyes radiating
Kiss the lips of steel that never speak

Cold tomorrow's eyes upon a new day
Listen to the sound that it reveals
Stop to touch a stone that rolls away
Kiss me in the dark with lips of steel
Kiss me in the dark with lips of steel
Kiss me in the dark with lips of steel"
293,Jean-Jacques Goldman,Peur De Rien Blues,TRJEVZJ128F426A88C,1987,"Y a des choses qu'on peut faire
Et puis celles qu'on doit pas
Y a tout c'qu'on doit taire
Tout c'qui ne se dit pas
Des vies qui nous attirent
De brûlures et de clous
Oui, mais ne pas les vivre
C'est encore pire que tout
De sagesse en dérive
De regrets en dégoûts
Y a qu'une guitare à la main
Qu'j'ai peur de rien

Quand les juges délibèrent
Si j'fais mal ou j'fais bien
Si j'suis vraiment sincère
Moi, j'sais même plus très bien
Quand les rumeurs vipèrent
Quand l'image déteint
Il m'reste ce vrai mystère
Et ça, ça m'appartient
Quand j'frôle la lumière
Qu'un instant je la tiens
Avec ma guitare à la main
J'ai peur de rien

Y a des choses qu'on pense
Qu'on voyait pas comme ça
Mais on garde le silence
Et on presse le pas
Des regards qu'on détourne
Des gestes qu'on fait pas
La conscience un peu sourde
Et pas très fier de soi
Quand la dose est trop lourde
Quand l'blues va un peu loin
J'prends ma guitare à la main
Et j'ai peur de rien"

Oh, give me the beat boys
And free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll
And drift away
Oh, give me the beat boys
And free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll
And drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wasting time
And I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
Now it's up to you to carry me through

CHORUS

When my mind is free
You know melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitar's coming through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you're givin' me
And now I want you to know I believe in the song
The rhythm, the rhyme and the harmony
You helped me along, you're makin' me strong

There's Dasher 
And Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous 
Reindeer of all?

Rudolph 
The Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh 
And call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history""

298,Eric B. & Rakim,My Melody,TRMQRLB12903CD2CA1,1987,"Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm lettin knowledge be born, and my name's the R
A-k-i-m, not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm sayin, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distortin', ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze MC's to make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise, like a poet
Keep you goin' when I'm flowin', smooth enough, you know it
But rough that's why the moral of my story I tell E.B.
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody

So what, I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I seen
One of these four MC's so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test it,
Let 'My Melody' play, then a record suggest it
I'm droppin bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breakin' I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap? All of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
'Cause I'm playin ball or bobbin' in the hall
Or just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
You shouldn't have told me you said you controlled me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'm a tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for Ra
Switch it around, it still comes out R
So easily will I e-m-c-e-e
My repetition of words is check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratch in and cut in a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't a came and said my name and run same weak shit
Puttin' blurbs and slurs and words that don't fit
In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rockin party to party, backyard to yard
I tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods

The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rockin, mine, no introduction
'Til I finish droppin science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Usin' a melody and add new verse(?) and notes
So when the mic and the R-a-k-i-m
It's attached, like a match I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to pursue with the momentum except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter,
A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder

I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet, etcetera
Extra event, the grand finale-like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words bein' spoken
Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin'
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way and I'll veto on the word's protest
MC's that wanna be vissed(?), they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 MC's put 'em in a line
And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
Now that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin'
No fessin', no messin' around, no chewin'
No robbin', no buyin', bitin', why bother
This slob'll stop tryin', fightin' to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
And if I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucka duck MC out there
'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody

Yes, my melody
Eric B.

Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it
Eric B. made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for MC's in the place
They try to listen cuz I'm dissin them so pick up your face
Shook off your neck cuz you try to detect my pace
Now you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
The melody that I'm stylin', smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather - inclined to be clever
MC, you'll beat the R, I'll say ""Oh never""
So Eric B., cut it easily and 
check out my melody..."

Infecting everyone we meet

She's only fourteen, in the seventh grade
If her daddy only knew he'd be screamin in his grave

Say goodbye to your mama if you're gonna hang out in Smash Alley

She's huddled in the gutter and she's shiverin with cold
She's so high strung I'm on the tip of her tongue
Kneeling in the alley all covered with scum

300,Billy Joel,Prelude/Angry Young Man,TRJDYUB128F4261DCB,1987,"There's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl,
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost,
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.

Give a moment or two to the angry young man,
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand.
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood,
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good.
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door,
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.

I believe I've passed the age
Of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight.
I once believed in causes too,
I had my pointless point of view,
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right.

And there's always a place for the angry young man,
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand.
And he's never been able to learn from mistakes,
So he can't understand why his heart always breaks.
But his honor is pure and his courage as well,
And he's fair and he's true and he's boring as hell
And he'll go to the grave as an angry old man.

Yes, there's a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl,
And he's always at home with his back to the wall.
And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost,
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man."

Got no other, need no other

See it in the open wheatfield 
Swaying softly in the breeze 
With all the grace and all the ease

When the night was closing in

When you turned and slipped away
Left that crystal promise

I'm boarding boats and planes
But I kept that crystal promise
Forever here in my veins
