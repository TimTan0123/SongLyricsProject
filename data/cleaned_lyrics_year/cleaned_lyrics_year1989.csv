0,STRATOVARIUS,Darkness,TRURRVA128F9340F51,1989,"Living on the edge of falling down.
Like each day would be your last one.
Reaching for the stars that shine so far.
Take my hand it will be alright.
For you and me to go.

Look into my eyes they are black as night now.
You can see your reflections I tell you no lies.
You are the prisoner of your own feelings it´s true.
There´s something inside you but you just won´t
let it come out.

When the night comes you won´t be alone.
´Cause I will be there I will be there.

When the darkness enters into your room.
Don´t be afraid ´cause I´ll be there.
When the darkness enters into your room.

They will put you down with their minds of steel.
Despise and scorn you just because they cannot feel.
Hell is eternity hell is your destiny.
I can see it in your eyes that you want to say
But you can´t.

When the night comes you won´t be alone.
´Cause I will be there I will be there.

Listen to me hear you´re playing
A dangerous game.
There is no time to waste anymore.
Because it is getting so late.
Get what you got give what you can.
Leave all the mem'ries behind.
They´ll be haunting you forever."
1,The Mamas & The Papas,Twelve Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming To The Canyon),TRDBFMU128F9312CF0,1989,"I used to live in New York City
Everything there was dark and dirty
Outside my window was a steeple
With a clock that always said twelve-thirty

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the mornings I can see them walkin'
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can't keep myself from talkin'

At first so strange to feel so friendly
To say ""Good morning"" and really mean it
To feel these changes happenin' in me
But not to notice 'til I feel it

Young girls are coming to the canyon
And in the mornings I can see them walkin'
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
And I can't keep myself from talkin'

Cloudy waters cast no reflection
Images of beauty lie there stagnant
Vibrations bounce in no direction
But lie there shattered into fragments

Young girls are coming to the canyon (Young girls are coming in the canyon)
And in the mornings I can see them walkin' (In the mornings I can see them walkin')
I can no longer keep my blinds drawn (Can no longer keep my blinds drawn)
And I can't keep myself from talkin'"
2,Joe Cocker,Unforgiven,TREAYDR128F145ACBD,1989,"As long as I am unforgiven
As far as I am pushed away
As much as life seems less for living
I still try
Let me say

For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can anytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine

If everyone would tell the truth
If I could only tell you why
If knowing me is any use to you
I'd still try
Let me say

For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can everytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine

For you
I'd do it all in a heartbeat
I know I can everytime
The time we'd find in a heartbeat
Is endless
As long as you're mine."
3,Lizzy Borden,One False Move,TRCYWQS128F934ABBE,1989,"My eyes see inside myself
Look away look away look away
The sky is black and so is my heart
I'm afraid I am pain I am death

I'll be your fool
I am your slave
But one false move and you're blown away

Action speaks I will die for you
In the end I pretend I was cruel
You're all inside me don't try and hide me
Cuz I am you and you are begging me to stay

I'll be your bad guy 
I will portray
But one false move and you're blown away"
4,"Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry",(I Don't Know Why) But I Do,TRVRWYP128F92F567E,1989,"I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do

I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
And since you've been away, I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do

My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I manage, but I do

Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wastin' time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do"
5,Rosendo,Loco Por Incordiar (Directo),TRLQKME128F423C34D,1989,"Voy de aspirante a debutante y no doy más
llegará mi oportunidad.
Paso un mal rato haciendo el pato y sin hablar
llegará mi oportunidad.

Y estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar.
Estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar.

Es importante que me plante sin jugar
llegará mi oportunidad.
Pongo un zapato sobre el plato y a escuchar
llegará mi oportunidad.

Y estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar.
Estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar.

Es fascinante por delante y por detrás
llegará mi oportunidad.
Pero es ingrato y tengo flato de esperar
llegará mi oportunidad.

Y estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar.
Estoy aquí loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar,
loco por incordiar, loco por incordiar."
6,Eric Clapton,Before You Accuse Me (Album Version),TRHYXQL128F14B106F,1989,"Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else 

I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
Well your mother said ""Son""
""Don't call my daughter no more"" 

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else 

Come back home baby, try my love one more time
Come back home baby, try my love one more time
If I don't go on and quit you
I'm gonna lose my mind 

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else"
7,Lords Of The New Church,Like A Virgin,TRHLMGR128F1456EDA,1989,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats 
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat 
Next to mine

Wow hoo oh oh ho oh
Wow hoo oh oh ho oh
Aah!
Wow hoo oh oh ho

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
I've nothin' to hide

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats 
Next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh ooh ooh hoo hoo
Like a virgin

Feels so good inside
When you hold me..
And your heart beats
And you love me...

Oh ho ooh oh ho
Oh oh oh ho ho
Oh ho ho

Ooh baby
Yeah

Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?"
8,GBH,Hellhole,TRQQLFY12903CD5627,1989,"The poor man he had no dreams, had no vices all he had was himself.
Spent his days walking around, thinking of things to do with his time.

It's like a dream when I wake and scream.
I'm lost and alone and living in a hellhole.

Looked at himself then looked at the world, decided things weren't going too well.
Just a man with a sense of justice, would his days of misery never end.

Bought a gun disciplined himself, shoot those those bastards right between the eyes.
Crime figures fell like dead leaves, the city breathed a sigh of relief.

It's not easy when you're making a stand, when it seems that all the world is mad.
It's easy to fall by the wayside, but if you act like a sheep you'll get eaten by the wolf.
Now the streets are safe for children to play, couples can go walking in the park.
The poor man is happy now, an unknown hero and nobody knows his name."
9,Marty Wilde,Sea Of Love,TRAOYLB128E0784C47,1989,"Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I wanna tell you just how much I love you

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

Come with me to the sea, the sea of love"
10,Maria McKee,To Miss Someone,TRNRTNJ128F424C064,1989,"I've been keeping busy since we've said goodbye
But all I do is think about you
The days are quick, the nights are long
I feel them tick, I watch them crawl
I'm petrified of running out of things to do
'Though I've never really been in love
I know now what it means
To miss someone

I have not been winning since we've said goodbye
Nothing fits and everything feels wrong
I guess it's useless to deny it
I'll admit that I've been crying
Guess I'm not so independent after all
'Though I've never really been in love
I know now what it means
To miss someone

Sometimes I dream we find each other in the night
And pass each other by
But part of me is running through every vein
Inside of you
I know where you're going I know where you've been
I know everything about you
The walls inside my head will shake
The very second that you break
I'd sell my soul to keep yours at my heel
'Though I've never really been in love
I know now how it feels
To miss someone"
11,Swing Out Sister,Precious Words,TRNROKF128F145A9FC,1989,"Another strange awakening
Another memory on its way
Another night in an empty room
Another throw away day

How long
Must I go on fooling myself
In a world of make-believe

Precious words
Are all that I have left to prove
That I've nothing more left to lose

Precious words won't bring you back to me
Precious words won't bring you back to me

Loneliness says much more
Than a thousand words ever said
Conversations pass me by
I'm left with silence instead

How long must I go on fooling myself
In a world of make-believe

Precious words
Are all that I have left to prove
That I've nothing more left to lose

Precious words won't bring you back to me
Precious words won't bring you back to me

You left my world empty
Now there's nothing to say

Precious words
Won't bring you back to me...

How long
Must I go on fooling myself
In a world of make-believe

Precious words
Are all that I have left to prove
That I've nothing more left to lose

Precious words won't bring you back to me
Precious words won't bring you back to me
You left my world empty
Now there's nothing to say
Precious words
Won't bring you back to me"
12,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Fire (2003 Digital Remaster),TRWWFPN128F14A1EB9,1989,"Well all right
Now dig this

You don't care for me
I don't care about that
You got a new fool

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...

Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy

You say your mom ain't home

And let Mr Huckleberry take over...
You know he's bad
You know he drowns
You know who he gives it to
Yeah!

That's right
Now dig this

You try to give me your money
You better save it babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire

Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire
Oh, funky fire...
Let me stand next to your fire

You better slide your ass over, girl

I'm coming the way you must be"
13,Todd Rundgren,Two Little Hitlers,TRAZJWO128F931E8EC,1989,"Why are we racing to be so old? 
I'm up late pacing the floor
I won't be told
You have your reservations
I'm bought and sold

I'll face the music, I'll face the facts
Even when we walk in polka dots and chequer slacks
Bowing and squatting, running after tidbits
Bobbing and squinting just like a nitwit

Two little hitlers will fight it out until
One little hitler does the other one's will
I will return, I will not burn

Down in the basement
I need my head examined
I need my eyes excited
I'd like to join the party
But I was not invited
You make a member of me
I'll be delighted

I wouldn't cry for lost souls you might drown
Dirty words for dirty minds, written in a toilet town
Dial me a valentine, she's a smooth operator
It's all so calculated, she's got a calculator
She's my soft-touch typewriter and I'm the great dictator

A simple game of self-respect
You flick the switch and the world goes out
Nobody jumps as you expect
I would have thought you would have had enough by now

You call selective dating for some effective mating
I thought I'd let you down dear, but you were just deflated
I knew right from the start, we'd end up hating
Pictures of the merchandise plastered on the wall
We can look so long as we don't have to talk at all

You say you'll never know him
He's not a natural man
He doesn't want your pleasure
He wants as no one can
He wants to know the names of all those he's better than"
14,Weird Al Yankovic,Generic Blues,TRGHPYQ12903CC8E3F,1989,"I woke up this morning
Then I went back to bed
Said I woke up this morning
Then I went right back to bed
Got a funny kind of feelin', like I got broken glass in my underwear
And a herd of wild pigs is tryin' to chew off my head
You know what I'm sayin'?

Well, I ain't got no money
I'm just walkin' down the road
Said I ain't got no money, honey
So I'm just walkin' down this lonely ol' road
Well, I wish I could get me some money
But I forgot my automated teller code

I was born in a paper sack
In the bottom of a sewer
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast
My family was so poor
My daddy was a waitress
My mama sold bathroom tile
My brothers and sisters all hated me
'Cause I was an only child
I got the blues so bad
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out, mama
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead

I'm just a no-good, scum-sucking, nose-picking, boot-licking, sniveling, grovelling worthless hunk of slime
Nothin' but a low-down beer-bellied, bone-headed, pigeon-toed, turkey-necked, weasel-faced worthless hunk of slime
I guess I've got a pretty low self-image, maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time

Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk
Okay, now make it shut up

Plagues and famine and pestilence
Always seem to get me down
I always feel so miserable
Whenever I'm around
I wish somebody would come along
And stick a pitchfork through my brain
I'd flush myself right down the toilet
But I'd just clog up the drain
I got the blues so bad
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out, mama
Or maybe I'll go bowling
Or I just might go bowling
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid-lookin' shirt and go bowling...
Instead"

Yeah..
Yeah I like that guitar man, yeah
Yo E-Love I like the way you flipped that guitar man
Knahmsayin? It was a good idea man, knahmsayin? Yeah
It's kinda like freakin me, yaknahmsayin?
I wanna get hype man, I wanna do this, yaknahmsayin?
Just gon' chill, check it out

Slick as Vasoline, smell good as cologne
I'm like a muscle man in jail -- they leave me alone
I rhyme like Superman, you rap like Jimmy Olson
I break you like a bottle of green Golden Molson
You ain't a real rhymer, you look like a actress
How you gon' sleep on me holmes, do I look like a mattress?
Am I that old, do I walk like Grady?
I'ma hundred-fifty proof, Smirnoff is only 80
Don't you EVER try to rock my house
I'm a real cool cat, know what I'm sayin Mickey Mouse?
The poetry specialist, so take a dose of this
Now think about it -- can you really come close to this?
You soft as powder, weak as a cabin cooler
Ugly as work shoes, messin with the Ruler:
the ultimate writer reciter and def entertainer
I work myself harder than a boxer's trainer

[Chorus: LL Cool J]

Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)

You're dog doo-doo, I'm watchin you get weaker
You can't believe, the skill and dexterity
LL Cool J, and the J is for Jeremy
So BUFF ME, James Todd the earthquaker
That's right my brother, you're goin out like Sega
{*censored*} chewed, so whassup dude?
One of my battles'll get your girlies in the mood
Sucker MC's really make me sick
I'm so bad, I can suck my own {dick}
If you go to your girl's house and I'm there already
Don't go Crazy cause my name ain't Eddie
Rhymes so rough, it's like a course in trigonometry
When Einstein was talkin, he was talkin bout ME
The Prince of the Earth, and I'ma give birth
to a rhyme so hard you look soft as a Smurf
Gigglin and wigglin, so how we goin out?
LOVELY, and that's without a doubt!

[Chorus 3/4X]

[LL Cool J]
Rappers are my servants, they serve me like an emperor
When I'm through, you'll need a nurse to take your temperature
and cool you down, cause you're cold as leftovers
Not the ones on the table, I'm talkin about RUFF rovers
You can't get over -- what's my name, Goofy?
You smoke I'm no joke, so my brother break out the looseys
and take a pull, cause the buck stops here
I get swift as a magician, wreck {shit} and dissapear
Don't cross me, or lose your loyalty
to the Prince of the Rap Court, I'm royalty
And it ain't no puzzle, it's a shame how rappers guzzle
paragraphs I put together so I carry a muzzle
to shut em up and cut em up and make em be quiet
I'm a one man RIOT, so don't even TRY IT
The Prince of special tactics, plus I'm athletic
Before you play your hand you better do some calisthetics
Jumpin jacks, squats, push-ups, the whole nine
Speak your piece, then I'ma go for mine
And I guarantee you, I'm gonna strike again
I recommend my friend you drop the pen and give in
Cop out to one rhyme cause you're facin ten
I ain't Sidney Poitier but we can 'Do This Again'
I'm nice wit mines, and I gotta admit it
You don't really wanna battle, why don'tcha just forget it!

Check my stats, how we livin, I thought so
I'm fresh, oh yes, but can they flow, hell no
My rhymes are up to date, excellent, on point
I'm tellin you, they're the serious joint
I eat my steak fast, I drink my brew slow
My voice is milky with a nice clear flow
I eat like a fat man, and walk like a gigolo
I'm not a ballplayer, so now Y'KNOW!

Seguí sus huellas y el mar se las llevó.
Su sombre me persigue
Desde el día en que ella se marchó.

El Norte es el reflejo
De la estrella del Sur,
Oriente y Occidente romper el mar azul,
Vagando a la deriva
Las tormentas serán mi única luz.

Quiero navegar sin banderas hacia el rumbo ideal.
Rosa de los Vientos,
Sólo espero el momento de volverla a encontrar.
Y no descansaré.

Rosa de los Vientos testigo de su final,
En el horizonte la luna sale ya,
Muchos han partido,
Pocos han podido regresar.

Rosa de los Vientos dime si amanecerá
Por los que nunca pudieron olvidar.
Aunque mi alma esté vacía
Mis lágrimas pueden llenar el mar.

Quiero navegar sin banderas hacia el rumbo ideal.
Rosa de los Vientos,
Sólo espero el momento de volverla a encontrar.

Ahora estoy dormido pero despertaré,
Me arrastra la corriente hacia el amanecer,
Si lo sueños crecen libres
No tengo nada que perder.

Quiero navegar sin banderas hacia el rumbo ideal.
Rosa de los Vientos,
Sólo espero el momento de volver a aquel puerto,
Sólo espero el momento de volverla a encontrar.
Y no descansaré."

With 3-inch cherry red press-on Lee nails
Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking
Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking

Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk
You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk

You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
You're all mixed up like pasta primavera
Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera, man?

'Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
So get that money out of your ass you whore
I brought her upstairs onto the roof
I dogged your wife and she is a doofus

What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What comes around, goes around

Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got
Dolemite's house and you have not
Look out my window look over the city
With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty

Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat
Why you wanna beat your girl like that
Living in the rat race smoking rat weed
You reap what you sow when you plant the seed

Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto

What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What comes around, goes around

What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around"

To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

You can start with 'Please don't leave me'
And end with 'I love you'
And if you'd only kiss me
The way you used to do
You could see a miracle come true

You've got five minutes
To tell me what I needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that you're really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

You've still got five minutes
To figure it out"

The edge is on, sharp as a knife
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind

Contemplation, meditation, all that jive
Taking out the medicine just before sunrise
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind

I just want to love you and that's a fact
I just want to tell you when we get back

You're just the kind of woman do a man all night
You're just the kind of woman that's a dynamite
Underground tremor, stop it with a dime
Hey girl, call me if you change your mind"

You think it gets you some place
You're sold a bill of goods and taken in
Perfections calling but you can't repay
Your reflections appalling so harder you try

You sit and puff that stogie
That's your third cup of coffee
But still you count those calories
You can't win

TV's the crime
Training your mind
No pain, no gain
The pounds you retain

[Chorus:]
Machine dream
Machine dream believe
Machine dream
Machine dream believe

The pressure that you're feeling
More corporate wheeling, dealing
Eat this, buy that, you fat rat
Be perfect too!

The image is perfections
The difference is what's inside
The shell is all that matters
All the toys that you buy

[Chorus:]

You're catching up with them
But the Jones' always win
Simple human race
All value placed on face
Push, work, sweat, one more try
Give it up!"

A blueness in the distance,

Now I climb the creaking stairs,
And walk upon a vanishing floor to get nowhere,
A little Mussolini screaming in my mind,

History will tell you lies,
History will tell you lies.
Your dream is buried by the dust of ages.

Time to sing a travel song,
For all the days that come and go,
As we move on,
Erotic summer heatwave buring in my memory,
Travel over hills and plains,
See the hidden valley's golden grass aflame,
A mother tongue that licks away your secret fear.

History will disappear,
History will disappear.
Your dream is buried by the dust of ages.

Quite a load to carry,
Everything that we have done,
Searching my horizon for a glimpse of the millennium.

Hasn't been so very long,
we haven't even half begun,
To peter out,
A version of the future,
Living in my mind,
I'm leaving it all behind,
It hasn't all been done,
History will tell you lies,
Your dream is buried by the dust of ages,
On the Young Mountain all four winds will blow,
From the Young Mountain wild rivers flow,
History will disappear,
On the Young Mountain a path unwinds,
On the Young Mountain who falls shall climb,
Climb the Young Mountain,
Cross the first river,
Swim the new sea.
On the Young Mountain all four winds will blow,
Leaving it all behind,
From the Young Mountain wild rivers flow,
History will tell you lies,
On the Young Mountain who falls shall climb,
On the Young Mountain all four winds will blow,

If you need me, I'll come running
If you want me, I'll come running now
If you love me, I will run, run, run, run, run, run right away

I'll reach out and end the storm that tears your world apart
And I'll reach in and break the chain of pain around your heart
Now I know how it feels to be lost and found
Won't let nobody, nothing tear you down
Just think of me, I'll be around
Be around, be around, be around

And if you need me, I'll come running
If you want me, I'll come running now

And I'll come running right away, yeahhhh

Is the truth I've spoken myself
A pack of lies is all I get from
Anybody else
Experience shows that I'm right
So be careful what you choose to
Believe

You can't believe in nothing
Insane to trust in anything
So I don't trust in no one
But myself

What happened to your honesty
Did it take a back seat
To your greed
Forgotten cause you've
Found out you need to live a lie
And if you question why you have
A future without security
Just fear and lies and terror
No one can tell you why

You can't believe in nothing
Insane to trust in anything
So I don't trust in no one
But myself

Synthetic creatures ordered
And numbered
Unsympathic to everyone
Death of intelligence and
Emotions
Preordained from death to day one

Lost trust in the future
Lost faith in prophecies
Lost truth in government promices
Lost hope for honesty

You can't believe in nothing
Insane to trust in anything
So I don't trust in no one

And they play it hot
Behind the green door

But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out
What's behind the green door

Tried to tell 'em I've been there
Door slammed
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there)

Saw an eyeball peepin'
Through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me
Someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door

These broken words are not my life
Your lies are none of my invention
Your promises were not my plan

Now the party girls have gone
I hear the rattle of their heels
Before their footsteps fade
Make promises pay

Will shake this house
Shame
Will shake this house

The passing time is not my life
I've been counted down and shouted out
I had everything I wanted, nothing I can't rise above
To let it show was not my plan

Sell weddings and divorces
Make promises pay
Make promises pay

So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way"

Every boy and every girl, 
Need the loving. 
The humble and the great, 
Even those we think we hate, 
Need the loving. 

Soldiers of the Queen, 
All the hard men that we've seen, 
Need the loving. 
Babies at the breast, 
Those in power and those suppressed, 
Need the loving. 

Let's face it you just can't hide, 
Your first taste'll send you reeling, 
Like a firework to which we're tied, 
Be prepared to go through your ceiling now. 

The loving's coming, 
The loving's more than just an ad man's vision. 
The loving's strumming, 
On your heart strings, 
So loud that you can't help but listen. 

Sailors on the seas, 
Or the clergy on their knees, 
Need the loving. 
All the rich and poor, 
Even those we fight at war, 
Need the loving. 

That thing that we need most of, 
That stuff we should try before we've died. 
Everyone is begging to be loved, 
With a free gift, a working heart inside. 

The loving's coming, 
The loving's advertised in all the papers. 
The loving's humming, 
Your favourite song, 
For once it won't annoy the neighbours. 

The loving, the loving. 

All round the world, 
Every boy and every girl, 
Need the loving. 
Cold-hearted or warm, 
Every single person born, 
Needs the loving. 

Way out there in space, 
Think we'll find that alien race, 
Needs the loving. 
And just to end the list, 
Everything that could exist, 
Needs the loving. 

The loving's coming!"

Someone left the golden door ajar

Innocent they stand and picking up across the ground
They hope to clear a path in garden this whole year around
When they all line up
When they all line up
Chicken surely knows that fox so well
Chicken understands that fox so well

Over the fence and down the field
Runs that fox so sly
Stealing embryo
Take those golden go

Dreaming, I am
Dreaming, I am
Dreaming, I am
Dreaming, I am

Try to fly in desperation, wings come into view
Nicotine is from my system, assistance
Sleep, I have been sleeping for so long
Run with safety underneath the feet they so adore
Hen suspects the fox on guard beside the golden door
Sweating from my system

I'll tumble down the wall

'Cause he wants to feel the shock of the new

With acid the falls that falls from the sky
And out of the silence your voice says why?

If it's love you want
Love you want

But you're asking why, oh, life makes you cry?
Turn moss into roses and blood into wine

It's a matter of time, a matter of time
But all of your past still plays on your mind
And maybe tomorrow you'll live by design
It's a matter of time

This isn't giving this isn't living
Ooh, just days that pull you apart
And tears turn to rust that fall on still hearts

So swallow your maybes and cradle your babies
Tell them that they will come through
Their gonna feel the shock of the new

Drinking adeps and effluence, smearing myself in congealing blood
I tear at sauted crackling to guzzle on fetid swag
Butchered remains are carved and collected in a doggy-bag...

I mince up your limbs, off-cuts and cartilege
Stuffing freshly-drawn intestine with grated coronary arteries
I slice from your mutilated trunk runny fats and rind
Skewering eye-orbits, brain, genitals and organs I grind...

Bins od torrid offal where writhing stomachs squirm
Chunks amongst your thighs and rump, crawling with tape-worm
Snapped spinal column is gnawed, curdled trypsin turns into cheese
Your vena cava lashed, on your pericardial sac I feed...

And if I could but her favour win

How could you fancy a factory maid

Dressed like unto the Queen of May

As for your fine girls I don't care

But I could not speak nor yet get in
The pleasant bed that my love laid in

Where nowt lies there but a factory maid?
A factory lass although she be
Blest in the man that enjoys she

O pleasant thoughts come to my mind
As I turn doen the sheets so fine
And I seen her two breasts standing so
Like two white hills all covered with snow

The loom goes click and the loom goes clack
The shuttle flies forward and then flies back
The weaver's so bent that he's like to crack
Such a wearisome trade is the weaver's

The yarn is made into cloth at last
The ends of weft they are made quite fast
The weaver's labour are now all past
Such a wearisome trade is the weaver's

The girls have gone to weave by steam

And trudge to the mill in the early morn

I suffocate
I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

You fracture me
Your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness
And prayers for rain
I deteriorate
I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

In dirty city dust
And now you're standing all alone
Nothing you can trust
Many people passed your way
Nobody called your name
You feel the cold December morning
You feel the pain

So you look back to all the wishes
All hopes you had before
Hope you have to cry no more

And your body
Shivers in the wind
Nobody at your side
Giving you a hint
How to start a better life
How to get through
You wonder
Can it be true

So you look back to all the wishes
All hopes you had before
Hope you have to cry no more

And suddenly
You start to run
Running for better times
Running for the sun
You think it's hopeless
But you better go and try
Maybe tomorrow
Your chance will take you high

So you look back to all the wishes
All hopes you had before
Hope you have to cry no more

Hope you have to cry no more"

Cause us to fall

Screaming from hunger and pain
Scream for relife from this misery
Searching for someone to blame

Turn the world into a bomb

Crying for they don't understand

for asking you once

Where do I turn when you turn away

You never ever put me down
But when I speak you turn around

there would be no doubt
but the only words are
""we'll work it out""
Well that's not saying much
You just don't take the time
And that is where I draw the line

You're sending signals
first of hope then insecurity

You use lies

""It's ladies night in Italy, you gentlemen should know.""

When I saw that neon sign, knew just where to go
Her shoulders soft so I pulled off, her headlights are aglow
A bartender said to me, boy I want you to meet my sister
She's high-strung and a little young, but she's a real Texas twister
A real Texas twister

I said ""How young is too young?
How fast is too fast?
Well, how high is too high?
Yeah, how high is too high?""

She said ""How long is this ride?""
Well, how long can you last?
You're gonna find out mister
When you meet that Texas twister

Well in the light she looked all right when we stepped outside
I knew that it was meant to be, yeah, when she begged me for a ride
That bartender said to me, boy take your money back
Before you're done you're gonna need it son
You might have a heart attack

I seen the sights now, Paris, Rome
And I ain't sentimental
I still remember how she said
Aww, ""Is this a Continental?""

No babe, it's just for flash and I paid cash
She hugged me up real tight
Lay back honey I'll drive you home
'Round the world tonight

She knew where every roadhouse lies, clear down to the border
Long neck Lone Stars just her size, clearly made to order
Knew how to paint a cowboy town, long before I missed her
She picked me up; she put me down, she's a real Texas twister
A real Texas twister

I said ""How young is too young?
How fast is too fast?
Well, how high is too high?

Oowah Oowah ah ah ah-ah Oowah Oowah ah

My old desk doesn't arabesque,
in the morning when I first arrive.
It's a pleasure to see it's waiting there for me
to keep my hopes alive.
Such a comfort to know it's got no place to go,
it's always there.
It's the one thing I've got, a huge success,
my Good Old Desk.

My old desk never needs a rest,
and I've never once heard it cry.
I've never seen it tease, it's always there to please me
from nine to five.
Such a comfort to know, it's dependable and slow,
but it's always there.
It's the one friend I've got, a giant of all times,
my Good Old Desk.

Oowah Oowah ah ah ah-ah Oowah Oowah ah

My old desk isn't picturesque,
but it's happy as a desk can be.
We never say a word, but it's perfectly alright with me.
For when my heart's on the floor, I just open the drawer
of my favorite guest.
And what do I see? But a picture of me
working at my Good Old Desk.

And you know that I almost believed you

And all this emotion
Can't explain my hopeless devotion
Or change what had to be.

And think about the past 
About how you could have done things differently 
But it happened way too fast.  

Just close your eyes, go to sleep 
Let the angels bring you dreams.
Let that pain unwind behind you
And float away, float away on silent streams.  

You gotta live your life the best you can 
Though you sometimes do your worst. 
You gotta laugh when you fail, it's not the end of the world
Life is a play you can't rehearse.

Don't make big plans for tomorrow,
You can't control what lies ahead. 
You must try to live each moment 
As it comes instead.  

There is no use dreaming of a perfect future 
Or regretting a troubled past.
It's only today that counts 
Live it like it might be your last.

It's only today that counts 
Live it like it might be your last.  
It never helps to worry, it never hurts to pray, 
Tomorrow will come soon enough; 
Just pray about today.
And relax, trust your life to God, 
The future is in his hand,
Only faith will help you face each day's demands.  
Ain't no use worrying, life goes so fast.

It's only today that counts 
Live it like it might be your last.

Live it like it might be your last."

Dont know why my heart's the last to know

Still in love...
Still in love with you
I know I've been lying to myself 
Baby its you
I dont wanna believe it 
But what can I do

Still in love with you
I know I've been lying, lying all along
Baby its you
And the more I deny it
The more that its true"

We robbed a man in Tennessee
The sheriff caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

Asked the jailor when's my time up
He said, ""Son, we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean
We may make a good man of you yet""

I couldn't wait to do my sentence
I broke out of the Nashville jail
I just crossed the line of Georgia
And I can hear them bloodhounds on my trail

I washed my hands in muddy water
I washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream"

Down there by the river is a man
Whose horn is twisted into shapes
Unknown to the wicked and the wise
And he bears the look of an animal
Who's seen things no animal should ever see
He has been driven beyond all towns
And all the systems until now though it is
Long past too far he keeps going

Because it's a desert
Because it's a desert

We come to the river
We'll walk away from all this now
We come to the water
We'll walk away from all this now

She first saw him he was standing in the doorway
Illuminated from behind by a light
Though imaginary posses chased them
To these distant adobes
Standing on the cliffs today
I thought I saw you below
My shadow growing smaller

It's a desert because
Because it's a desert
They'll be asking me about you forever
I guess

We come to the river
We'll walk away from all this now
We come to the water
We'll walk away from all this now

Long coats on the prairie
Lying in the dust
Who can I turn to ?
Who can I trust ?
Were you walking on the water ?
Playing in the sun ?
But the world is turning faster
Than it did when I was young

When I was young
When I was young

Oh, when I was young I was a wild, wild one"

A boy of 14 years got a taste of Southern law
He saw his friend a hanging and his color was his crime
And the blood upon his jacket left a brand upon his mind

Too many martyrs and too many dead
Too many lies too many empty words were said
Too many times for too many angry men
Oh let it never be again

His name was Medgar Evers and he walked his road alone
Like Emmett Till and thousands more whose names we'll never know
They tried to burn his home and they beat him to the ground
But deep inside they both knew what it took to bring him down

Too many martyrs and too many dead
Too many lies too many empty words were said
Too many times for too many angry men
Oh let it never be again

The killer waited by his home hidden by the night
As Evers stepped out from his car into the rifle sight
He slowly squeezed the trigger, the bullet left his side
It struck the heart of every man when Evers fell and died.

Too many martyrs and too many dead
Too many lies too many empty words were said
Too many times for too many angry men
Oh let it never be again

And they laid him in his grave while the bugle sounded clear
Laid him in his grave when the victory was near
While we waited for the future for freedom through the land 
The country gained a killer and the country lost a man

Too many martyrs and too many dead
Too many lies too many empty words were said
Too many times for too many angry men
Oh let it never be again"

as a stranger within me grew.
Detached and distanced from the day
while youth's precious years flew.

Chasing time through empty skies
of endless hours,
living for the future.

Visions of brighter days to come
kept the shadows from my sight,
made the present bearable
and obscured the fading light.

Chasing time through the cold void
of solitary days,
living for the future.

Today is within my reach
and tomorrow is so illusive.
but I'm still chasing time
through increasing disillusion,
forever living for
the future of an illusion."

Terror builds, as the thought of being dead
Prophecy of the wisemen of old
Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil
Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead
The dead awake, what the populace is fearing
Panic strikes as the nations run in fear
Oceans boil with blood of human victims

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmuted corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us

Tables turn as a victim I've become now
State of death only waiting to return
Vital signs that show I'm dead
This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave
Hunger grows not nutritionnal but instinctual
Flesh becomes my only crave of this live
Unthinking state, a state of metamorphosis
Seeking food to keep me dead

Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his error
Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill
Seeking human victims to meet my fill
Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain

Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain
As its fluids drip down the drain
Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder
The vile stench only makes me madder

In through the mouth, out the forehead
Brains fall out, skin turns red
Violent surge, a spear through the skull
Felt the urge, now my heart's full

I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

I love gore, blood drives me nuts
I drink blood, I don't like water
Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter
Twist its neck, make it crack

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmuted corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us

Blood I want to drink, I want to suck
Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck
Bones into a spear, I'll carve and kill
Hunger for the quest, I'll never fill
Blood I want to drink, I want to suck
Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck

And my heart seemed to know
That love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look
And I had found my future at last
One look
And I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you"

Can take her place

No, no

Love will make you drink
Make you stay out all night long,
Lookin' for love
But there's no, no substitute,

I wanna tell you a story,
True, true, true story about love
Many times, many times, over 'n over, over in life,
So many people have tried, tried, to get a substitute
An' it just don't work, work on love

You may not be good looking,
You may not be so fine
But love, love, love love, love, love,
Is a burning thing
It's a burning thing
I know, I know, I know, I know,

He could live a life of toil, with his future in the soil,

The only way to deal with racism if you're black

Well, seven in the morning I woke up to jog
Rushed out the door to inhale the smog
As I ran, I began to wonder
Should I produce or should I tour this summer
Well just that second I heard stay where you are
Before I could stop I was hit by a cop car
I laid on the pavement like I was hurt
Then a redneck cop jumped out with a smirk
He said, ah boy you better watch where you run
as he poked my side with the barrel of his shotgun
I said Officer man I ain't do nothin
He said what's that word you n----s use, ya frontin?
Well ya frontin, so why were you running down the street?
At this time I had stood to my feet and said Wait a minute
And that's when he did it, he hit me in the face with his gun I wasn't
with it so
On the ground was a bottle of Snapple, I broke the bottle in his fucking
Adam's apple
As he fell his partner called for backup well, I had the shotgun and
began to act up with that

(Chorus)

Well I threw down the gun and began to run
I got back in no time and loaded the nine
First I took two clips and then I took two more
I was out the window cause by now they were right at my door
I took three shots and then I laid
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade
It went boom like a supernova
Badges arms heads legs cops were all over
I jumped out the fire escape down to the street and I started to run you
know I couldn't feel my feet, I was weak, I said to myself Holy shit!
My shirt had filled with blood I didn't know I got hit but there's no
time to stop no time to explain man I'm in too deep with this everyday
ghetto pain
Black men are judged by their clothes
Black women are looked at as hoes
So I as one of these uppity n----s
Can only rely on the sound of a trigga going

(Chorus)

Well I staggered down the street to an old bookstore
Called the Tree of Life (Yo D it ain't there no more)
But when it was boy I was lucky
Cause in the basement is where they stuck me
When I awoke at the 14th hour
Three black women had gave me a quick shower
I stayed a while and escaped in a truck
Driven by two guys, Rakim and Chuck
What the fuck I asked as I laid there How many guys do you drive a day
there? Chuck said many, Rakim said plenty it's an everyday thing when
you're willing to sing a song...

I'm baying at the moon

I take too many planes
I know too many names and I
forget them
I wanted to know if dreams

You said they would try and I
said let them
You just let them
But I kill dreams in the chase
I slap love in the face

For something that was truer
than I intended
I ended up on my knees

In a midnight blue school uniform
Lips just a little too full for her face
Distant eyes full of space
In her posture no trace of coquette
No defiance

She fingers the frets looking forlorn
Crossing her legs where her tights have been torn
Starts as her mother comes into the room
And the afternoon grows still
And her mother feels chill
Shivers and buttons her coat

I gently correct the curve of her back
And open her book in the now-empty flat
At the classical piece I've had her prepare
And her arms are bare as she plays
And I draw back behind her ear
A few strands of hair gone astray

She shows me her bracelet, the lesson is done
I turn it around between finger and thumb
We sit face to face and it seems to me that
Her face is the face of a cat
And touching the place where her breasts will be
I press my hand flat

She comes into my lap, I turn her around
Her hands clasp my neck and her feet skim the ground
Her skirt travels up under my palm
But the pupil sits looking so calm
As if listening to the distant sound
Of a burglar alarm

What happened next it's hard to recall
The guitar lesson left no traces at all

Know what they were fighting for
Can everybody
Give and take a little more
Because it's all too easy to forget
That you can fight 'til there ain't no reason left
So everybody, sing

E gli occhi hanno un amplificatore

Persone piene di paura che qualcuno possa sapere 
I loro piccoli e grandi contraddittori pensieri 

...all'improvviso scappi via 
Senza salutare 
I tuoi occhi scendono le scale 
Non so cosa vanno a fare 

Se a commuoversi o a sognare 
Ad arrabbiarsi o a meditare 
Ma nell'anima si sa 
C'è sempre molto da fare

Beyond reason, beyond logic, beyond fear

Just imagine meaning in the things you never dreamed of
Like your leaders, your lovers, and your songs

Giving everyone a cause

Dreamer dreaming in a seeming sleepless land
Just imagine:

Just imagine something inside nothing
Like a child in emptiness
Or a dreamer in the dark
Creative cryogenics - a mind
A candle yearning for a spark

Dreamer dreaming in a seeming sleepless land
Just imagine:
Just imagine peace where there was none before
Under virgin skies
Just imagine children with hope
Again in their eyes

Just imagine:

Just imagine people really caring
And not just saying they do
Just imagine nations really talking

But more and more I'm thinking, that the only treasures that I'll ever know

Home was a back porch swing where I would sit and mom would sing amazing grace 
While she hung out the clothes,
Home was an easy chair with my daddy there and the smell of Sunday supper on the stove
My footsteps carry me away but in my mind I'm always going home

Now the miles I put behind me ain't as hard as the miles that lay ahead
And its much too late to listen to the words of wisdom that my daddy said
The straight and narrow path he showed me turned into a thousand winding roads,
My footsteps carry me away, but in my mind I'm always going home.

That other men have loved you before

But you drew your face away
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

If I had one ounce of pride
I'd stand up or step aside
But I still love you
Mmm, hmm

So I'll accept the crumbs you drop
Cause I'm a fool and I can't stop or rise above you

Let him speak up for themselves
I speak for me and no one else cause I'm a beggar
Knocking on your door

But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

I'm too far gone to turn around
And pick myself up off the ground
And start all over
And over

Now one of us must win or lose
No matter which one you may choose you'll in clover (you know you will)

While you're making up your mind
I'll be praying all the time
Praying that you'll never let me go

But you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

Mmm, you work your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore

Yeah, you do your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore"

Groovin's so easy, baby, if you know how.
You don't have to keep yourself forever, baby,
Go out and chase whatever you're cravin',
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you.

There's nobody stopping you, baby, there's just yourself,
And if you can't see that, baby, girl you need help.
I could teach you things, you never could learn,
Show you just exactly how you got burned.
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you.

It's easy to see now, baby, you're nobody's fool,
But you won't gain nothing, baby, by staying cool.
Better leave all your troubles and worries behind,
Give in to something, well it crossed your mind.
It doesn't have to be,
No, no, it doesn't have to be,
So hard on you."

Ya don’t you know it’s always nice to see a friend
Ya I see you time and again

Well I ain’t been up to nothing I’m just hanging around
And you can find me in every single stinkin’ bar in town
Lord I do get around

But there’s no way out so I’m stayin’ in
Drinkin’, drinkin’ my blooze again

I’ve got my friends, conversation is fine,
We chip in a buy a nice cheap bottle of wine
yeah that cheap stuff works everytime

We get along ‘cause we’re one and the same
We’re all messed up, washed up, out of luck
It’s a shame, Lord it’s a cryin’ shame

Ya but there’s no way out so I’m stayin’ in
Drinkin’, drinkin’ my blooze again
Start drinkin'

Now I ain’t talkin’ about no light-weight, penny ante weekend warrior
I’m talkin’ bout drinkin’
Talkin’ when got two bucks left, you don’t want nothin’ to eat
You just gotta keep drinkin’
Talkin’ bout when you get home at three but you don’t make it til four
Cause you can’t find the door
I went home went straight to my bed, I didn’t make it that far
Fell flat on my head
Woke up to the morning light, burned a hole in my brain
Cause the sun’s so bright
Reached out for the first thing I could find was as half drunk bottle
Of some cheap wine
I stood up and I drank it down, started my day by spinning around
And I cant see nothing through my bloodshot eyes
The way I’m livin’ you'd guess it ain’t no surprise
Ya, whether I live or I die
We’ve seen it work we’ve seen it all before
We got you now you’re such a tragic bore
You keep knockin’ on my door

Ya but there’s no way out so I’m stayin’ in
Drinkin’, drinkin’ my blooze again
Ya but there’s no way out so I’m stayin’ in
Drinkin’, drinkin’ my blooze again"

Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, cuz I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
I kick it just like this...

Verse 2

I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, cuz I'm that type of man
Cuz I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
Cuz when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader

Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it cuz I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
Bust it!

Verse 3

MC's I'll ruin, cuz I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavour's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
Cuz I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from a architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
Cuz I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how...and I'm chillin', never illin'
In my mouth I got two fillin's...whatever!
I'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over
My name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it..."

She's the star in all my movies
She's the song that sings my feelings

Out in the alley in the street

Buzz all around like a bee
Shake it like a ship on the sea

Came all the way from Paris France
Come into Atlanta to get a chance

Grab your mama and hold her tight
Let's mess around the rest of the night

Grip your head way up high
Grab your daddy and make him cry

People come from miles around
Get in Dark Town to break them down

Down in dark town night and day
Trying to dance them blues away

Go all the way back to Newport News
Singing these doggone Atlanta blues"

To a restless wind
This time I'm not gonna chase it again
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words
I woke up crying and no one heard
You're looking through me like I never was real
You say you love me but you won't let me feel
So I'm gonna take a chance this time
I'm gonna find myself a place where I can heal

And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read
I'm heading west

I said my name
Under my breath
He turned me down a twisted road
I won't forget
I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all the string
Hold on to hope, let go of everything
I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said
The altitude of freedom seems to got my head
And if I fall down on my knees I'm gonna get back up
I'm gonna get back up again

And I'm heading west
Without a sad goodbye
And I'm heading west
I'm like a letter with no address
Just like a book I read

Mister Ford sez to Mister Firestone
When they meet at the old campground
""We will send out the news by wire and
Tell all the people what we have found
We can ask Thomas Alva Edison
Telephone Alexander Graham Bell
And if someone comes here with something to sell
Just make yourself clear and tell him to go straight to hell
Trade war!
For your peace and our protection
Give us speed and new direction
Someone needs to mind the store
Trade war!
As is mentioned in the Bible
Nations tend to what is tribal
Across the ocean white with foam
Spend your dollars here at home"" 
Mister Ford turns to MisterFirestone
""Well the nation has gotta roll
Time has come for the Yanks to load up the tanks
If a victory is our goal
To show the world all about free enterprize
Cut the competition down to size
We must make it a date to participate in cooperation
We are a nation at war
Trade war!
We are thinking of survival
At the brink with each new rival
Here to even up the score
Trade war!
Competition now is global
Give your country what is noble
If you're an eagle you must soar
We are a nation as at war! 
There's a bomber up in the sky tonight
'Cause the two brothers Wright took flight
Man has gone to the air to keep the world fair
Show the others where might makes right
When you look up in the wild blue yonder now
And see a star or a satellite
On a Yankee's invention it may depend
So lend us your spirit bright!
Trade war!
Don't sell land to the invader
Tell him come back maybe later
We don't do that anymore
Trade war!
Thanks to our man Ronald Reagan
He is gone and we are begging
For just the interest on the loan
And calamity unknown
Trade war!
For our lands and independence
For our children and descendants
We must hold them at the door
Trade war!
And the sparks have started flying
Though your heart says you're denying
Our love for all humanity
It's what keeps us breathing free
Trade war!
Make it legal make it tender
May our nation not surrender oh no!
For just one race to rule the world
Keep that battle flag unfurled!"""

Falls to the floor
And all your wild days
Oh fall away
Can't see much point in them anymore

In this house of dreams
I let you walk like a ghost unseen
Girl on the day you left
Out walked my everything

Must have thought you'd always be there
I never even noticed when the changes came one day
Seems one minute you were standing close
I turned around again
And girl you were far away

And every plan we made
Oh I just let them fade
And pile up on the floor
Beside the bed
Now you're gone away
Oh but your memory stays
I sit here thinking of the things I never said

In this house of dreams

Started off as sex for fun
Now the girl's got him on the run.

Made love to her just one time
Now she runs his body and mind
He calls everyday on the phone
But Baby's playin' games
Leave a message at the tone
Soft and gentle is not her style
This girl is so damn wild.
All my partners wanna get next to her

Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away.

See your empty life all around, life and death both around.
Scream in pain, for life.
For death...live your death!
Not knowing which way you want to go.
Indecision for yourself.
Not making sense of past events.
Complacency itself.
Life will take a life on this frightful day.
Searching for the truth.
Can the chance be taken to end it all.
The never ending quest.
The pain within ceases to halt.
Frenzied state no one's fault.
Execution of your soul.
See the light but you can't.
Scream in pain, for life.
For death...live your death!"

In my face to cramp my freedom,
Phoney ladies that mess me up, 
Calling names to cramp my freedom
And you don't even wanna see them 
Calling names to cramp my freedom
Phoney ladies that mess me up.
Nobody's gonna grab my freedom, 
Nobody's gonna mess me up.

You becoming a victim of the game,
Don't you forget I'm your sister and your friend too.
The way you treat me will put this house to shame,
Your secret conversations put you in the frame.

Sometimes I see so clear
Just like the way we always were
So young and free from fear

I lose my fear of war and dying
And all the clouds just disappear
Only my mirror sees me crying
Each time I lose another year

Wouldn't it be a drag to be like you
Settling down and having kids
And telling them what to do
Well I'm gonna stay

Nineteen forever, yes I am
Nineteen forever, I'm gonna be
Nineteen forever, yes I will
Nineteen forever

We can do magic in these times
Be what we want to be
We'll all be rock 'n' roll stars
Immortal on TV

And if you see me looking tired
I've just been sleeping through the day
But I got something to keep me wired
So we can dance the night away

Wouldn't it be a drag to be like them
They're gonna sell out everything
But I won't get fooled again
'Cause I'm gonna be

Nineteen forever, yes I will
Nineteen forever, no matter what you say
Nineteen forever, I'm gonna be
Nineteen forever

You better believe it
You know my dream's still alive
You can love it or leave it
But I'm never gonna be thirty-five

She's heard it every single day of her life.
He's got to wonder what she sees in him
When there's so many others standing in line.

She gives herself to him, but he's still on the other side.
She's alone in this world, She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.

She shows up at this doorstep in the middle of the night,
Then she disappears for weeks at a time.
Just enough to keep him wanting more
But never is he satisfied.

And he's left to pick up the pieces, wondering what does he do this for.
She's off in her own little world, She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.

He said ""Before I met her, I didn't love nothin.'
I could take it or leave it, that was okay, but
She brings out a want in me
For things I didn't even know that I need.""

She does anything she wants, anytime she wants to,
With anyone. You know, she wants it all.
Still she gets all upset over the least little thing,
When you hurt her, it makes you feel so small.

And she's a walking contradiction,
But I ache for her inside.
She's fragile like a string of pearls.
She's nobody's girl.

She's fragile like a string of pearls.
She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl.
She's nobody's girl."

Half-sick of shadows grayer

It's four hours after twelve
And you're scared of yourself
Feeling so afraid
Like a child in an air-raid
 
And if there's only one reason
To live in this world
I'll find it
And if there's only one reason
To give of yourself
Ask the lonely and the dying
 
If your drowning in the doubt
As the candle goes out
Faces at the window
And a whispering that won't go
Focus on the dawn
And the promise of morning
Look ahead of winter
Let the breath of summer into you
 
And if there's only one reason
To live in this world
I'll find it
And if there's only one reason
To give of yourself
Ask the lonely and the dying
 
They're always waiting for morning
Always waiting for light to come around
Always waiting for morning
And the light to come shining in
 
They're always waiting for morning
Always waiting for light to come around
Always waiting for morning

I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you?  Please, don't even try it

Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out

Mentre dici stupidaggini incredibili
E mi fai ridere con le lacrime agli occhi

Un cuore che non si conosce mai

Lets be honest with each other 
That's the least that we can do 
I feel guilty when they envy me and you

We were young and foolishly mistaken 
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied 
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'

Many ways so little time to think
Life's catastrophe
Glass empty and I really need a drink
Movin' all so very quick
Movin' so fast that its gets me sick
Let me outta here
Livin' ain't livin' with the tension and the fear

Never thought too important to mention
Livin' with the birth, the birth of tension
Never thought too important to mention
Livin' with the tension, tension, tension"

To the hills where the gunfire rings around
On ? town

Common words can't say I'm surprised
From a mouth I would half expect a lie
Or at least a 'Sorry, I...'

I wanna know where my honour went
Like before she was in his bed
Wanna know why a ? was instead
And I did not know

I stumbled blindly, no light to lead me
I fell forever down desperation
I lost my dreams to this mad desire
What means the most takes the most to realize

Want to talk, want to pick my bones?
Just in case you find one more stone to roll
Down my throat

You cut me, words like a forest fire
Run your hands through the ash behind my smile
Left from some other while

I want to know where my manners went
Flip a coin from the barkeep's hand
Shine it up, so it's ready to be spent
On another

I stumbled blindly, no light to lead me
I fell forever down desperation
I lost my dreams to this mad desire
What means the most takes the most to realize
Takes the most to realize
Realize...

A distant cry of help from others
A child's brain in a world of greed
It's all around you, can't you see?
Or are you blind to the like of me?

Politician, I see through your charade
Speaking all your brainless lies, you're all the same
Mister preacher, please tell me what is right
Send the double figures, son, you'll see the light
Look into the distant future
Will they have a tax on nature?
How much more will still remain?
They actually call themselves humane

I deny all you see
I don't have to believe

It's god's way, says your horrid wife

Embezzling, indulging
I believe your nose is growing
Extorting, not reporting
Your pockets are overflowing

Tell us one more thing
How much holiness did you bring?
I see right through you
Soon they all will too"

When the clock on the wall keeps movin',
Time stands still,
No matter how the dice may fall,
Someone else always get's to call the number

Say goodbye cruel world,
No pity, no pain tonight,
Whatever the cost all is lost,
If it is love with no name,
Then it's all in the stars,
Whether it's wrong or right,
There's no one to blame no lies,
What else could we do

Made a dream for you,

Maria, mein Gesang
erbittet Dich um Gnade
Für Menschen, die schon solang
Ganz und gar ohne Hoffnung sind,
Ganz ohne Hoffnung sind
Siehe dort ihr traurig Dasein
Der Hunger tiefst, der Angst vor dem Tod
Millionen leben hier auf Erden,
immer noch, in allergrößter Not
Ave Maria

Ave Maria
Santa Maria
Erhöre mein Gebet, Maria
So vieles Leid, das schon geschah
Warum kommt immer neues Leid?
Nur neues Leid?
Lass nun die Menschen wieder glauben
Lass sie verstehen und verzeih'n
Dann könnten alle Völker Freunde
Und alle Rassen Brüder sein
Ave Maria

Lass nun die Menschen wieder glauben
Lass sie verstehen und verzeih'n
Dann könnten alle Völker Freunde
Und alle Rassen Brüder sein

220,Toxik,There Stood The Fence (Album Version),TRSOMGE12903CC2AB9,1989,"There stood the fence that penned me in when I was younger
This was the house where we all stayed
There was a tree we used to hang out under
This was the place where I played
But now that's gone so I have to wonder
Is it worth the price we pay?
A long range test has put us under
And made us go away, go away...

This was the town where all my friends and I had grown up
The only place I've ever known
A long gray street with some houses built on it
Less than perfect but it was home
Now it's gone and I curse it in my darkness
This is the cross I have to bear
We pay the price of our own injustice
We made us go nowhere
Go nowhere, nowhere


This was our earth our garden of Eden
Took what we could and left her there bleeding
And what became of the hopes and the dreams
Did they die with us 'cause that's how it seems
Here comes the rain can't you taste the acid?
Or has it left you numb?
This is the moral to the story I offer
Can you hear me son...
Or have you gone away
Away
Away"
221,Kitty Wells,Amigo's Guitar,TROJORX128F1459A68,1989,"Tonight they're singing in the villas tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me while Amigo plays his blue guitar
Ay ay ay ay the moon is lonely tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Manana morning my darling I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar

They've hushed their singing in the villas all is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego upon his lonely blue guitar
Ay ay ay ay the moon is lonely..."

Now what's it going to be
You've had it

But all I wanna do is be with you

Tearing me up and watching you land
Sitting your heart on the sofa with me"

Was it fun or just a bad thing to do

I’ll find some way to make you pay

But then you come and you pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
A word and a will made

And drink, my cabinet’s open wide
I’ll take something to make me go wild
In truth, good fortune sets me free
Would vengeance make a killer of me

Pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
I need some food, some sleep
Some company to keep
The sun, some shade
And somebody’s bed

Lull me around, drag my bad name down
And people say
Lull me around, drag my bad name down

Oh Jesus
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around
(Drag my bad name down)
Would Jesus pull me around

I’ll take some books, films, changing my will

Batter up!   batter up!
With His eye on the sparrow you'll fly like an arrow on high
Batter up!   batter up!
Whether losing or winning in only beginning
You'll make it on home by and by 
You take a bat of pine
From some denuded forest
The glove was made by Mr.Spaulding
From a cow in Salvador
And by some power divine
The crowd joins in the chorus
It is a case of now or never
And you can hear them roar

Down a lot of roads
Thinking love was something to be bought or sold

And it's right here in your eyes
Now my golden dreams are of golden rings
Precious love without a price 

I'm going for the gold
For the heart's that's in you
I'm going for the love
That I know will be true
I've had enough
Of those one night stands
I'm going for the gold that's in a wedding band 

I followed those illusions
That sparkled in the night
But they were fantasies that disappeared in the light
The midnight fires that burned so bright
Turn to ashes in the dawn
I didn't realize how empty I was inside
Until you came along 

I'm going for the gold
For the heart's that's in you
I'm going for the love
That I know will be true
I've had enough
Of those one night stands
I'm going for the gold that's in a wedding band

230,The Charlie Daniels Band,Play Me Some Fiddle,TRAFYNS128F4271F6F,1989,"Every time I hear a fiddle and it's cookin' just a little
Well, it makes me want to jump up and run
And if he's sawing with some soul boogie woogie rock 'n' roll
Well, I know I'm gonna have some fun

And when the rosin' starts to fly and I'm lookin' in the eye
Like I'm just about to blow a fuse
Mama, call the doctor 'cause your boy has got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues

I met a man from Tennessee, this is what he said to me
He said, ""Music is a rhapsody""
He picked up his violin, stuck it underneath his chin
And started playing me a symphony

I said, ""That ain't the way it's done, let me see that fiddle son
And I sawed him off a chorus or two""
He said, ""You'd better call the doctor 'cause I think I've got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues""

Now if you want to play me some fiddle
I'll tell you right from the start
You'd better play me something lowdown hoedown honking
I don't want to hear no funeral march

It's got to pick me up and roll me over
It's got to make me want to jump up and sing
If it ain't buzzing like a beehive, kick it into overdrive
Or it don't mean a doggone thing

So let me rosin' up my bow and I think that I can show you
The way I like to play this thing
Let's put some boogie rhythm in it, kick it on up to the limit
I'm gonna put some fire on these strings

And if you feel your feet start moving to the beat
And you feel like you've got ants in your shoes
Well you'd better call the doctor 'cause you've probably got
The rocking boogie woogie fiddle country blues"

So I can go out driving with you
Down on Hollywood Boulevard
On friday night, dressed right
I don't take no trouble smoke at the wall
But I still have that leopard-skin hat
That you gave me way back
Before it was cool
And they took it to school

Here in the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind

Hey we wild it up, wild it up

I like to dance with my rooner
Cuz when we dance I feel like
We are who we've meant to be
He puts his arms around me
I put my arms around him
And I feel satisfied and free
One night I tried my bandanna around his wrists
And we started to sway and it felt so good
And he said "" looky here mamma, looky here
I think I better just see you
Safely out of the neighborhood""
That is to say

The ghetto
The ghetto of my mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind

Hey we wild it up, wild it up

Outside my window the noise is all I've got
There are no stars in the sky
Just the sirens and queens
Breaking glass down in the parking lot
That's the world where I live
Sometimes I wonder, oh how can I go on ?
But I know that the world you make inside your head
That's the one you see around, that's what I said
And the one you see
Is the one you make

Inside of the ghetto
The ghetto of your mind
Y aqui, the ghetto
The ghetto of my mind

Hey we wild it up, wild it up"

When they laid her in the grave

missed my mother, she was gone

what a home so sad and lone 

Will the circle be unbroken

There's a better home a-waiting 
in the sky, Lord, in the sky

Hymns of faith that made us strong 
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us 
Hear the angels sing along

Najdoskonalszy swego władcy twór
Kwiatowy pył osiadał ci na stopach
Twarz chłodził tresowany wiatr
Zwierzęta grzały cię puszystą sierścią
W źrenicy tańczył strumieni błysk
A w zamian za to tylko posłuszeństwo
Uległość wobec Pana
Więcej nic
Tylko pokora wobec bezwzględnego nieba
Miłość do tego tylko co potrzeba
A ja nie mogłam bezczynnością żyć upojną
I zrobiłam to czego nie wolno

Kaleczę sobie palce na kamieniach
A plecy jeszcze czują Archanioła miecz
I płaczesz idąc w dół po zboczu
U mojej szyi płaczesz ze zmęczenia
I nie masz nawet sił na starcie brudnych łez

- Dałam ci rozkosz
- Dałaś ból
- Dałam ci dumę
- I wstyd
- Więc powiedz po co jeszcze każesz mi iść z sobą
Skoro nie cierpisz mnie i drwisz?

with no insults and all morals,

I never get the chance; this is a fine romance!

A fine romance with no kisses,
a fine romance my friends this is,
to lack half the thrills that a healthy crime has,
we don't have half the thrills that the march of time has.

A fine romance with no clinches,
a fine romance with no flinches,

I've got imagination 
I got hallucinations 
Do you want some? 

I've got a dirty mind 
I've got a dirty mind 
Take a look at yourself 

Smelling like a rose 
Looking like a queen 
I'll have a double dose If you know what I mean 
Went down to the river 
With no one to trust 
When you know what you want 
Then you do what you must 
But you'd better think smart 
And take my advice 
Just think of nothing 
And double it twice 
I bought you a trumpet 
And a brand new suit 
Just don't be disappointed 
When you lick the fruit"

But every street I walk, I find another dead end
I'm on my own but I'm so all alone
I need somebody so I won't have to pretend

I know there's someone just waiting somewhere
I look around for her but she's just not there

Oh, doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me

I'm running free but I don't want to be
I couldn't take another day like yesterday
I'm dead on my feet from walking the street
I need somebody to help me find my way

I've gotta get out of this town
Before I do I'll take a last look around

Oh, doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me

You know, I'm no different from anybody else
I start each day and end each night
But it gets real lonely when you're by yourself
Now where is love and who is love, I gotta know

Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, where are you
Doesn't somebody want to be wanted like me, just like me

Make love to me, but make it all night.
To touch your touch, to feel your feel,
Your body next to mine.
To hear you'll always stay with me
Until the end of time.

I could never be without you,
I could never live alone.
I will be your friend forever,
Just keep me from life on my own.

I don't know how I ever found love.
Right up 'til now there was no such.
Please don't fear a thing about us,
Just believe in me.
If you ever fear you doubt us
Let me make you see."

I lost my love for you
I can't explain just why
I feel the way I do.

I only want to know
What made my love grow cold
What made me change my mind
Somewhere along the line.

The happiness I've known
No longer lives with me
I hold a passion for
The yearning to be free.

Whatever caused the change
Has left this mark so strange
My eyes for love went blind
Somewhere along the line.

Well it might have been
The night you tossed your wedding rings away
And it could have been
The many little things I meant to say.

A mystery,
I know I can't define
for I lost my love for you
somewhere along the line.
Somewhere along the line..."

You're so hot! What choo got?
On the outside I'm a good boy
Let me inside 'cause I'm full of joy
I don't want to shock you but I'm an electric eel
How's that make your denominator feel?

Think I'll surprise her
I can always depend on my great equalizer
I wanna grind, lose your mind
I kissed you once, but will I kiss you again?
Be certain with sex and you'll always have friends
Your glands wanna freak, your hands wanna speak
And your mind slips away at the peak

Recitation (A Poem of Love)

Time stops - the light goes on
A thundering head and no body
Washed up and woke up on the beach, 
seaside breakfast
A tender egg on white sand
Legs long and tan without a break, even to the neck
Suddenly, simultaneously, an eclipse and a snowfall
Flakes melt instantly on the shoulders like wet silver
Burning little holes all the way to the marrow
Puckered flesh like avocado sags into a green pool
All the birds leave turquoise ruts
across the Velveeta sky
It's time to scream

I wanna be your number 1 lowest common denominator"

To just anybody she please

The men all crazy about you
the boys are watching you too
I looked across the street girl
There stood nobody but you

Wearing that short dress baby
Way up above your knees
Says she's gonna show her big fine legs
To just anybody she please

I give a party last week
You came a taken the prize
Wearing that dress so short woman
way up above your thighs

Said my baby wears her dress so short
Way up above her knees
Says she's gonna show her big fine legs
To just anybody she please"

This wall can't divine our love - I pray
I need you - I wanna see you
No frontier can change my love

Cause every drop of love could be
A mighty stream of sympathy
And every stone is flowing away

Love is like an ocean
Love is where I'm diving in
Love is like an ocean
Love is a weapon which could win

A few footsteps - but worlds apart
And a thousand lonely fates
If they hold together with love
The stones come tumbling down

And every part of history
Builds up the wall and you will see
That every stone is flowing away

Love is like an ocean
Love is where I'm diving in
Love is like an ocean
Love is a weapon which could win"

You shared your secrecies 
And oh, how that makes me feel

I know in my heart I should 
I'll never ever do you wrong 
My love for you is strong

Why aren't you here 

We, we can't just let this die 
You gotta give our love a try 
Oh please be by my side 
Don't even begin to cry 
'Cause I, I'm waiting to be with you 
Just give me the chance to prove 
That I'm the only one for you 
You know I was the one

Keep people together forever and ever

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep people together forever and ever"

You know the moment that you crossed over the line 
A casual glance 
No one has to read between the lines 
In the south of France it was spring time 
Special feelings come alive 
There's romance in the air, so they say 
Love could be a small cafe away 

Love is a piece of cake 
And making love is all there is to eat 
It's a heart out of a lamb 
When yoy start to feel forever in a kiss 
But you must remember there's no point of refuge 
You only have a part in a lover's play 
And you could be the one left in the dark 
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart 

All too soon you're touching for the last time 
No one has to tell you how it is 
It's just a memory two people share 
File it under foreign affair"

See who'll be the lucky one.

All night long.

When the hanky panky is done.

But then she hangs out in my town,
And she tries to track me down.
She always wants to stick around,
Kiss the clown!

Hop in my car,
Take off for the cash station,
To get more money
To boost my reputation.
It's ladies' night at the bar,
I make a reservation.
I let the girls all buy me drinks,
That's instigation.

But then her eyes get big and brown,
and her words all marriage-bound.
But when I love you comes around,
Kiss the clown!

This ain't no romance, pretty baby.

But when the tide runs out
I'm still at the water's edge 

There's a deep deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that
Deep deep ocean
What's it take for you to be satisfied 

You walk alone at night
So secretive and quiet
I hear the roar of your heartbeat
So why do you deny it 

Hold me and show me my love can't be wrong
And I'll be swept away
By the storm beneath your calm 

There's a deep deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that
Deep deep ocean
What's it take for you to be satisfied
If you keep holdin' back emotion
One of us might drown in this deep deep ocean

What's it gonna be

Life lies in front of us
Sacred Ground, Rotten Earth

Ashes To Dust
Flesh Decomposed

Caressing the sacred ground
Where the deadened corpses lie
A sepulchral misty night
With a whiff of the Macabre

Silently watching the stones
Put there as a symbol of death

Silently watching the stones
Put there as a symbol of death

Our minds united, a force is lit and insight creates
A humanoid watchtower reaching for their souls to the Sky
For a glance into the Other Side"

The first and the last call
The rise? and time for?

Well I can't go 'cause I'm out back
I did my best to have some fun.
The last thing I needed was to go through hell
God, I've been there once.

W wierze w wyższą sprawiedliwość

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do that cannot wait

He drove his car to the racing grounds
He was the youngest driver there
The crowd roared as they started the race
'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace

No one knows what happened that day
How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath, they heard him say

Tell Laura I love her, tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die

And in the chapel where Laura prays
For her Tommy who passed away
It was just for Laura he lived and died
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry

I see you there and I just can't resist
You make me tremble like a jellyfish

It's primitiva
You got me
Oh
It's primitive
You make me feel
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh

I hear you calling out my name
And when you talk your words they numb my brain
You make this fire in me start
I want to touch you with my heart

I hear you whisper in the dark
And when you touch me I just come apart
I feel the fever in your hands
We feel things we don't even understand

It's primitive
You got me ... Oh
It's primitive
You make me feel
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh
It's animal

Like the moon pulls at the tide
I'm at your side
The world in which we live

Is primitive
You got me ... Oh
It's primitive

You make me real
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh"

I just need a friend
I don't want a lover
I just need a friend

You can't just leave me
To face life on my own
I know you don't love me no more
I knew this day it would come
Even when it cuts so deep
It's true I still want you
But the harder I try
The more I seem to lose

I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I've had time to recover
Now that I know it wasn't love

It's always a different story
When it's me who's in the wrong
But you can't have it all
Cause I'm the one who's strong
I've already been burnt before
Once but never again
I know the time will come
That's when you'll need me then

I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I've had time to recover
Now that I know it wasn't love

I don't want a lover
I just need a prayer
I know you never cared
Now that I know it wasn't love

You don't even care
About what I'm saying
You don't even think
What you're doing
All you see is what you want it to be
But in there there's just no room for me

I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I've had time to recover
Now that I know it wasn't love

You don't even care
About what I'm saying

'Cause tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do

What did I say
(What did I say)
To make you turn your angel eyes my way?

Well, I'm the guy who never learned to dance
I never even got one second glance
Across the crowded room, just close enough
Yes, I could look, but I could never touch

'Cause tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?

Don't anybody wake me if this is a dream
'Cause this is the best thing that's ever happened to me
Hey, all you fellas, yeah you can look all you like
But this girl you see, she's leaving here with me tonight

And there's just one more thing I need to know
If this is love, why does it scare me so?
There must be something only you can see
Yes, I can feel it when you look at me

Remember all the things we planned dear
And now I see them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad

Is it any wonder why I'm feeling blue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you

If you can have it, I can have it
All that's yours can surely be mine

And it's one for the money
To keep up with the Jones'
So you can look around and see you're not alone

Money wasn't meant for the poor
And it's truer now than ever before
You either have it or you don't 
So where do you fit?

It's never never when you need it
Always always when you don't but that's life

So then I try to be the understanding man
You just call a Woody Allen character about the whole thing
I said that's cool, I understand, I pack my bags
And get outta your face

Then for three days on end
She was in bed with my best friend
Discussing every problem
She cried, she begged, David, we didn't really do anything
He's a really understanding guy, and he really just listens
And I said
Baby, you gave him head
God damn!

You've been living life in the eyes of a stranger

Being with her wasted your life

I said ""what the hell, there's nothing else I can do""

I tripped over my shoes
Decided to go out
Cause I got nothin', nothin' to lose

Go to the closet
Ain't got nothin' to wear
Go to the Cupboard
And the cupboard is bare
Go to my parents
And there's nobody there
Get a flat tire
And I ain't got a spare

But I'm not worried cause
Cause I know what I need
I got a lover
And it's his love I feed

A real sweet cup
Will keep him up till morning comes

Your sweet love's so good, you've got me wrapped up in it
Since the day we met, you never fail to get me every time

Can you imagine if we never found each other
How life would be not having one another
All the joy we share that gives me that same feeling every time
Wouldn't it be nice if we could make it last forever
We'd be so content to spend our lives together
That's what I want to do with you
Make it happen every time
Every, every time baby

Thrill me so, I love you very much
And I can tell that you would never lose your touch
You give me what I need indeed
You make it happen every time
And every time we play, the things you do to tease me
Knowing what to say, anything to please me
Keeps me feeling new with you
It seems to happen every time

And through the years our love has shown us we can make it
The world is ours, just reach out and take it
All the love we need as long as we're together every day
Wouldn't it be nice if we could make it last forever
We'd be so content to spend our lives together
Make each day brand new with you
And make it happen every time
Every, every time baby"

Conservo aquel cariño que tuve para ti
Quien sabe si supieras 
que nunca te he olvidado
Volviendo a tu pasado
te acordarás de mí.

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción.

Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho,
Decí percanta: ¿Qué has hecho
De mi pobre corazón?

Al cotorro abandonado.
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana,
Como cuando estabas vos

Y aquel perrito compañero.
Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día
También me dejó.

Si supieras que aún dentro de mi alma
Conservo aquel cariño que tuve para ti
Quien sabe si supieras que nunca te he olvidado
Volviendo a tu pasado te acordarás de mí."

Ja värjätä huulesi
Mutta et kai luule että kivipuuteri

Sä voit kapakassa istua ja konjakkia juoda
Ja triviaalia pelata
Ja sä tiedät kaikki vastaukset
Mutta yhtä vain tiedä sä et:

Ja jäädyttää hymysi

Ettet luopuisi milloinkaan

più affiorano ricordi lontanissimi 
come se fosse ieri 
mi vedo a volte in braccio a mia madre 
e sento ancora i teneri commenti di mio padre 
i pranzi, le domeniche dai nonni 
le voglie e le esplosioni irrazionali 
i primi passi, gioie e dispiaceri. 
La prima goccia bianca che spavento 
e che piacere strano 
e un innamoramento senza senso 
per legge naturale a quell'età 
i primi accordi su di un organo da chiesa in sacrestia 
ed un dogmatico rispetto 
verso le istituzioni.

Che cosa resterà di me? Del transito terrestre? 
Di tutte le impressioni che ho avuto in questa vita? 

Mi piacciono le scelte radicali 
la morte consapevole che si autoimpose Socrate 
e la scomparsa misteriosa e unica di Majorana 
la vita cinica ed interessante di Landolfi 
opposto ma vicino a un monaco birmano 
o la misantropia celeste in Benedetti Michelangeli. 
Anch'io a guardarmi bene vivo da millenni 
e vengo dritto dalla civiltà più alta dei Sumeri 
dall'arte cuneiforme degli Scribi 
e dormo spesso dentro un sacco a pelo 
perché non voglio perdere i contatti con la terra.

La valle tra i due fiumi della Mesopotamia 
che vide alle sue rive Isacco di Ninive.

Dreaming of you and me
On a windswept beach by an emerald sea
Ooh..........ah...

Don't you know that
Love will come, love will come your way someday
And the hard times, 
Are just the price that we have to pay
For love will come, 
Don't you know, love will find a way
Yes love will come
Ooh..........ah...
Listen to your heart
The pleasure-pain of cupid's dart
Foolish ones who frown on sentiment
Will never find a prize that's heaven sent
Praying for you and me
For a million days filled with ecstasy
Ooh..........ah...

Life was just one endless shopping spree
Now we know love is the one thing
That we get for free
Or do we?

Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow 
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

I've seen the fire of a woman's scorned 
Turn her heart of gold to steal

Set to the rhythm of the wheel
And I've been dreaming like a child 
Since the cradle broke the bow

Indulgence, everlasting rage escaping through your pores
Day by day it grows so close, intensify the end
You know the day will come, we go beyond the end

What's in store, we fear no more, a blaze of ritual fire
Accept a form of life unknown by death, I am inspired
Hoping for a place of worship to pardon all my sins
This is where your life will end, beyond begins
Become at one with death itself and see where it will lead
Escaping from domestication, self-inflicted greed
Hoping for forgiveness, can you take the pain much more?
Soon your life will know just what's in store

Craving life beyond the end
To no avail, pull down your blackened veil
Assuming that your life was pure
Immense disease for which there is no cure"

He wrote the Psalms, a book of songs from His heart
Two thousand years later still a craze to praise
Not a phase, stand amazed at the infinate blaze
It's eternal, that's a fact, and I use rap
To bring glory mandatory cause the King will be back 

(repeat chorus)"
312,Mano Negra,Mad House,TRIISCQ128F1488815,1989,"My heart is like a big house
Full of ghosts and rats
A house without a window
And darkness livin'inside
So you came little Babe
And you turned on the lights
So you came little Baby
And you turned on the lights
You saw monsters they made you cry
You blew the lights and hide
My hearts is...
Now Baby won't you come back
Baby won't you come back
Won't you come back again
Voix off: She told me just before she's gone
That I'm a sucker I'm a punk
I'm violent everytime I'm drunk
She just can't stand a Wino Man
Had a dream last nigth
it was so bright
You! or was it Mr Hide?
Voix off: That's when the moon felt down, right up from the sky...
And broke my heart into pieces"
313,Los Suaves,La Noche Se Muere,TRFCLID128F421549A,1989,"Para no ver más a la muerte
yo me quisiera morir.
Y para dejar de quererte
contigo quiero vivir.

Cuando hay algo que se gana
siempre hay algo que perder,
más amargo que la muerte
es el amor de una mujer.

La noche se muere.
La noche se muere.
La noche se muere.
La noche se muere.

Para las penas y el olvido
esta canción escribí.
Es que vivir ya no consigo
ni contigo ni sin ti.

Una vez tuve esperanzas
pero a ellas renuncié;
más amargo que la muerte
es el amor de una mujer."
314,Miljoonasade,Kadonneet,TRFIMUO128EF3443D7,1989,"Tää on tanssi joka tanssitaan
Jalat yhdessä
Sudennahka olkapäillä
Ja otsa hiilessä
Tää on tanssi joka tanssitaan
Kun muut jo nukkuvat
Tämä tanssitaan koiran kanssa
Kieli pitkällä

Tää on kirja joka luetaan
Silmät ummessa
Pimeässä eteisessä
Veitsen valossa
Tää on kirja joka luetaan
Kun kuu on kumollaan
Tämä luetaan äidin kanssa
Unen talossa

Sytyttäkää kynttilä
Sytyttäkää kynttilä
Ja toivokaa sen palavan
Tuulen pyörteissä
Sytyttäkää kynttilä
Sytyttäkää kynttilä
Niin moni heistä katosi
Jotka etsii lyhtyä

Tää on laulu joka lauletaan
Kirja sylissä
Hämärässä portaikossa
Peilin edessä
Onko elämää enempää
Kuin on miehen liikkeessä
Kun se ojentuu eteenpäin
Lyhty kädessä?"
315,Monks Of Doom,Voodoo Vengeance,TRWDWJY128F930A0E7,1989,"Well she was tired and 22
Lost in this swamp
Laughing ... cheatin' shirt
What's that she's got?

Got me a rabbit for supper
I'm making chicken up
Don't touch my gun
I sip ground glass

Voodoo vengeance
Voodoo death
Squeakin' rats they run from the voodoo house

Trace little curlicues (track the little cutie-coo? -EC version)
All across the bayou
They'll put a lot of men in prison
For the things I want to do

I sprinkle rabbit guts all over her face
Stomp on it with my feet
Better give me what's mine or I'll take it

Voodoo vengeance
Voodoo death
Squeakin' rats they run from the voodoo house

Take a little brown rice
Add a little water
Threw in some ground glass, that was her vengeance

Now nobody can hear me (can crack ...)
I'm lost in the swamp
Naked in my bed
All covered in blood

Voodoo vengeance
Voodoo death
Squeakin' rats they run from the voodoo house"

No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can
The baby can

The way it feels just feeling you
Holding out and falling out
But the baby can
The baby can

I'm the jumping man
I'm the jumping man

But baby can float
Baby can drown
Baby can touch her toes
Toss her hair
Makes you feel you're going nowhere

Baby can dance
Baby can dance
Baby can walk around the town
Attract a man and cut him down

I'm the shadow man the jumping jack
The man who can and don't look back
But the baby can
The baby can

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel
No one looks and no one feels
But the baby can
The baby can

And the way it feels
I'm feeling you

But baby can float
Baby can drown
Baby can touch her toes
Toss her hair
Makes you feel you're going nowhere

Baby can dance
Baby can dance
Baby can walk around the town
Attract a man and cut him down

Everyday is far away
Everyday, everyday
It's over now
It's over now

I'm the jumping man
I'm the jumping man
But baby can float
Baby can drown
Baby can touch her toes
Toss her hair
Makes you feel you're going nowhere
Baby can dance
Baby can dance
Baby can walk around the town
Attract a man and cut him down"

Siempre tienes que aguantar
En el barrio, en el camión
Siempre tienes que oir la voz

Morenaza de mi alma!
Porque tan sola vas
Con este peloncito

Chaparrita preciosa
Dime que pensó dios
Cuando en vez de naranjas
Dos melones te dio! te te dio!

Siempre tienes que aguantar
En el barrio, en el camión
Siempre tienes que oir la voz
Y escuchaaa, escucha...

Como dos gelatinas
Las meneas al andar 
Como dos cebollitas
Están para llorar

No te enojes mi prieta
De lo que olles hablar
Enojona y coqueta
Te queremos aún más
Aún más!!

Siempre tienes que aguantar
En el barrio, en el camión
Siempre tienes que oir la voz

318,Phil Ochs,The Passing of My Life,TRPPSOG128F9347D0D,1989,"I've seen rivers red with blood,
I've seen valleys filled with mud;
I've seen stormy seas that pound upon the shore.
I've seen mountains strewn with bones,
I've seen people without homes,
And it's all with the passing of my life.

I've seen highways headin' down,
I've seen green grass turn to brown;
I've seen forests burn a couple days or more.
I've seen prairies filled with holes,
I've seen good men sell their souls,
And it's all with the passing of my life.

And as I see the fury of the fire and the flame
I wonder if my children will have to see the same.

I've seen rockets all ablaze,
I've seen dark and deadly days;
I've seen cities bombed and butchered to the ground.
I've seen battles by the score,
I've seen ten too many wars,
And it's all with the passing of my life.

And as I see the fury of the fire and the flame
I wonder if my children will have to see the same.

I've seen rockets all ablaze,
I've seen dark and deadly days;
I've seen cities bombed and butchered to the ground.
I've seen battles by the score,
I've seen ten too many wars,
And it's all with the passing of my life --
Yes, it's all with the passing of my life."
319,Danger Danger,Under The Gun,TRWFNFA128F426416C,1989,"Lost in the shuffle the hustle and bustle of the city
Just a sweet young girl in a knockdown world, such a pity
Well she never worried, growin' up in a hurry
No one showed her the right
She met a man, he took her hand one night

Out on the street all the people you meet
Wanna use you for your innocent ways
Running around you're the talk of the town today
You were so cool you played by the rules
You thought you had it in the palm of your hand
You're on your way to the top and
They won't let you stop 'til you're there
Now you're

Chorus:
Under The Gun
Out on the Run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It's bringing you down (bringing you down)
Livin' your life
Under The Gun

Under the lights, you're feelin' the bite
Of big city days and big city ngihts
Now you're alone, you wanna go home, but you can't
You're goin' outta your head, they're in and outta your bed
You're losin' sight of what you thought was the truth
They'll string you along 'til you're tattered and torn
Then along comes somebody new
When you're

(Chorus)

You were on the top but now you're runnin' out of time
Open your eyes, now you're under the gun, under the gun

320,Tora Tora,Riverside Drive,TRJVMKC128F14A3111,1989,"Oh it happens every now and then
Along the banks of the Potamus
When me and the boys gather some toys
And take care of a little bit
Sometimes it's crazy
Sometimes it's hazy
Sometimes it takes all night
In need of perfection
Bring your protection
Cause baby it'll feel so right
I don't remember the town
The town with the big bass sound

We're goin' down
To Riverside Drive
We're goin' down
To Riverside Drive

She's faster than the speed of sound
About the fastest thing I've known
She's been tryin' to make up her mind
Just who to let her take her home
Sometimes I rode in
Sometimes I'm flown in
Sometimes I just don't know
In need of perfection
Bring your protection
Cause you never know what's in store
I don't remember the town
The town with the big bass sound

Chorus
Hit the river

I'm gonna tell ya what I'm gonna do
When the moon stares me in the eye
You're actin' real good like you know you should
And I'll give you a piece of pie
Well sometimes I feel it
Sometimes I steal it
Sometimes I can get it on
In need of perfection
Bring your protection
Cause you're bringin' me down
I don't remember the town
The town with the big bass sound

We're goin' down 
To Riverside Drive
We're goin' down

We're goin' down

We're goin' down, down

Where did my tomorow go

Never ever let you go
When you're tearin' apart
Secret lover let me know
Let me know

I miss you so

I can feel your heart
Can you feel it
Never tear apart
Little Jeannie
Feel my heart is true
I miss you so
Little Jeannie baby don't go
You're too hot to hold my love
Don't stop
I'll never ever give you more

When I sleep alone
Secret lover hear my heart
Face the dream break your heart of stone
I'm a king without a crown
Believe it babe or not
Never ever let you go
When you tearin' apart
Secret lover let me know
Let me know"

Lyrics-Ron 

Face to face
Proposition is made
Surrender
All your rights
As a human
With no risk
At all
Hard facts
His word is
His bond
Rebirth
A hot sweaty
Grip of fear
Her cruelty
Can't be controlled
She's your mistress
Body and soul
You signed
A contract to die
She took you
In hand
The spin of her
Web began

Ritual submission
It happens everyday

Welcome pain
In a 
Different
Kind of way
Bite the bullet
To open
Up your brain
Narrow shallow
Closed minds
Always run a
Step off time
Four followers
And no leader
Daddy's boy
And a teacher
Breath deep
The poinson gas
Living in
The working class

Ritual submission
Ritual Submission

Black sky night
Spin in a 
Whirlpool
Moon lit woods
The dogs
Were howling
In disbelief
Past
Quail Hollow
Send no flowers
For the
Head of the
Maji
He'll get the
Grand tribute
When they
Scatter the ashes
So Van Dercar
And Salvador
Surrealism's
An open door
Ritual submission
Ritual ritual
Submission"
323,Bonnie Raitt,Nick Of Time,TRDXGMC128F1464472,1989,"A friend of mine, she cries at night
And she calls me on the phone
Sees babies everywhere she goes 
And she wants one of her own

She's waited long enough she says
And still he can't decide
Pretty soon she'll have to choose
And it tears her up inside

She is scared, 
Scared to run out of time

I see my folks are getting on
And I watch their bodies change
I know they see the same in me
And it makes us both feel strange

No matter how you tell yourself
It's what we all go through
Those lines are pretty hard to take
When they're staring back at you

Oh Oh Oh, scared you'll run out of time

When did the choices get so hard
With so much more at stake
Life gets mighty precious
When there's less of it to waste

Mmm-m-m-m-m-m

Mmmmmmm, scared you'll run out of time

Just when I thought I'd had enough
And all my tears were shed
No promise left unbroken
There were no painful words unsaid

You came along and showed me
I could leave it all behind
You opened up my heart again
And then much to my surprise

I found love, baby, love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love darlin', love in the nick of time
(Love in the nick of time)
I found love baby, love in the nick of time

Ooooooo-ooo-ooo-whoo-ooo
Yeah baby

Uhhhhh-huh-uh

Found love...
In the nick of time...

Thought I'd given up...
Given up baby...

Oh ooo wo ooo wo..."
324,Billy Joel,And So It Goes,TRAVJDN128F92EA542,1989,"In every heart, there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self-defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon, I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows"

And I know where I belong

When grief seems to set in

It's the love that I find
But I just don't have the time
It's a wish to be near you
It's being there

Ohh when I want to be there
For ya baby yeah yeah
Be there for you 
All for you

I think of you
When I know
It's gettin' harder and harder 
To let go
What was once
Only mine yesterday
You were my love
And my friend
You held on
To the very end
It's the pain and the loss
Of not being there

Ohh when I want to be there
For ya baby yeah whoooh
Be there for you
All for you baby

Oh when I wanna be there
For ya baby yeah whoaoh
Be there for you
All for you

It's a sad song that I sing
But I'll never let it bring
A bring me down
And bring my heart lower too

It's the leaves on the trees
It's a south wind
That's stirring me
It's just the season
A sensation of being there

Oh when I wanna be there
For ya baby yeah whoaoh
Be there for you

So we just know that you'll have no regrets
