0,The Icicle Works,Little Girl Lost,TRKEMPP128EF35F4EE,1988,"I don't know why it is you scare me
I don't know why I feel afraid
When you're around I feel uncertain
And lose sight of the plans I made

You've got the nerve to be demanding
When you have nothing to begin
And though you say your door is never
open to the world
I envy those who you let in

Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Lost little girl

The boys in town could do without you
Your mother's not sure who you are
And in the darkness I will hold you 
to your word
The only sound a passing car

Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Lost little girl

Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Lost little girl

Little girl

When you run for shelter
Yu don't feel the pain 
You don't agree with all the good things
As they are around you

I believe today may be 
The first time I've
Regarded you
with more and more
Passing admiration.

Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Little girl lost
Lost little girl"
1,Five Star,Godsend,TRISMBV128F9319CD4,1988,"Oooh, ooh
Baby, baby, baby, I'm sorry
I didn't treat you right
Baby, baby, baby, I miss you
I need to hold you
Need to hold you tight
Honey, honey, don't think there's ever
Been a fool such as I
‘Cuz now I know
Yes I know
What your love is really worth
What you offered me
Oh, was paradise
A little bit of heaven here on earth

Your love was a godsend
Straight from above
God sent your love
Your love to me
Your love was a godsend
But I sent you away
How much of a fool
Can one girl be
You're a godsend
Godsend
Won't you forgive me now
And send him back to me

Oooh, ooh
Baby, baby, baby, I'm livin'
In the shadows now it'seems
And every every every time the phone rings
I rush to answer
Hoping it's you
I spend every day
Locked away
In my room with the curtains drawn
But you know I can't face another day
Oh, I got to have you back where you belong

Your love was a godsend
Straight from above
God sent your love
Your love to me
Your love was a godsend
But I sent you away
How much of a fool
Can one girl be
You're a godsend
Godsend"
2,The Style Council,How She Threw It All Away,TRQRRUM128C7196E06,1988,"Of all the things that money can buy
freedoms never cheap
But all the things she needed in life - she had no need to keep.
Of all the things she asked of me
none were ever fun
And I'm no good at acting while - the cameras on the run.

Don't you know - she threw it all away
I wonder how she feels today.
She threw it all away
I wonder if she's there to stay.

I tried, a bit, to change into - something that I'm not
But trying to mould with dynamite is like giving lions spots.

Guess you knew - she threw it all away
Don't shed a tear there's no need to cry.
She threw it all away
I played both parts in the fool and I.

Yes, I know your hurting inside
but I can't stop those tears in your eyes, falling from your face
Everytime you fall apart
I knew at the start - when it happened again
it was the start of the end for us.

With all the things that money can buy
you'll never be alone
But thankfully you remembered the words
to I ""Can't Buy Me Love""."
3,Helloween,Eagle Fly Free,TRRDARD12903D037FA,1988,"People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
Everyday they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war

Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well your life seems quite bizarre

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
Follow the sign
Together we'll fly someday

Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime

Nowadays the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
Follow the sign
Together we'll fly someday"
4,Queensryche,Revolution Calling,TRWZTKT128F147348E,1988,"For a price I'd do about anything
Except pull the trigger
For that I'd need a pretty good cause
Then I heard of Dr. X
The man with the cure
Just watch the television
Yeah, you'll see there's something going on

Got no love for politicians
Or that crazy scene in D.C.
It's just a power mad town
But the time is ripe for changes
There's a growing feeling
That taking a chance on a new kind of vision is due

I used to trust the media
To tell me the truth, tell us the truth
But now I've seen the payoffs
Everywhere I look
Who do you trust when everyone's a crook?

Revolution calling
Revolution calling
Revolution calling you
There's a revolution calling
Revolution calling
Gotta make a change
Gotta push, gotta push it on through

Well, I'm tired of all this bullshit
They keep selling me on TV
About the communist plan
And all the shady preachers
Begging for my cash
Swiss bank accounts while giving their
Secretaries the slam

They're all in Penthouse now
Or Playboy magazine
Million dollar stories to tell
I guess Warhol wasn't wrong
Fame fifteen minutes long
Everyone's using everybody, making the sale

I used to think
That only America's way, way was right
But now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives
Gotta make a million, doesn't matter who dies

Revolution calling
Revolution calling
Revolution calling you
There's a revolution calling
Revolution calling
Gotta make a change
Gotta push, gotta push it on through

I used to trust the media
To tell me the truth, tell us the truth
But now I've seen the payoffs
Everywhere I look
Who do you trust when everyone's a crook?

Revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling you
There's a revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling (Revolution)
Gotta make a change
Gotta push, gotta push it on

Revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling you
There's a revolution calling (Revolution)
Revolution calling (Revolution)
Gotta make a change
Gotta push, gotta push it on through

There's something goin' on
There’s a revolution
There’s a revolution
There’s a revolution"
5,Jimmy Buffett,Prince Of Tides,TRFCLCQ128F146745E,1988,"Prince of Tides 
By: Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley 
1988 
Pat Conroy, Doc Pomus and the people of Dafuskie Island have already said it all. I am thankful for such inspiration. 
--Spoken: 
""The sun, red and enormous, began to sink into the western sky. And simultaneously the moon began to rise on the other side of the river with its own glorious shade of red, coming up out of the trees like a russet firebird. The sun and the moon seem to acknowledge each other and they moved in both apposition and concordance in a breath taking dance of light across the oaks and the palms. My father watched it and I thought he would cry again. He had returned to the sea, and his heart was a low country heart."" 

African drums are silent and the Wingos are poets at last 
Out on Dafuskie Island, the bulldozers bury the past 
And the low country sinks, she can not swim 
The dogwood feels the hurt 
While the foursome plays on borrowed days in their alligator shirts 

Chorus: 
Now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides 
How can you tell how it used to be 
When there's nothin' left to see 

One night they put a price on the sunset 
And that got the whole world shaking 
They rose from the grave both the weak and the brave 
'Cause history was there for the makin' 
And the winos surrounded the condos forming a frail human fence 
And they shouted out loud to the roar of the crowd 
""Same old story, more dollars than sense"" 

Chorus: 
Now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides 
How can you tell how it used to be 
When there's nothin' left to see 

Paperback novels make young girls dream 
And Judy's spending quieter days in the stream 
With Goodman, Giovinno, and John Mac D 
They were such good friends to me 

(instrumental) 

Chorus: 
Yes and now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides 
How can you tell how it used to be 
When there's nothin' left to see 

Chorus: 
Oh, and now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides 
How can you tell how it used to be 
When there's nothin' left to see 
Nothin' left to see 

Heaven knows but God decides 
Just when to kill the Prince of Tides 

You can dance (you can dance) every dance (you can dance) 
With the guy (you can dance) who gives you the eye (you can dance) 
And wants to hold you tight (you can dance) 
You can smile (you can smile) every smile (you can smile) 
For the man ( you can smile) who holds your hand 
Beneath the pale moonlight (you can dance, ba-dum) 
But don't forget who's takin' you home 
And in whose arms you're gonna be 
Save the last dance for me 

And beach music, beach music, beach music, just plays on... 

-- Spoken: 
""The white porpoise comes to me at night, singing in the river of time, with a thousand dolphins in radiant attendance, bringing charismatic greetings from the Prince of Tides."""
6,Another Sunny Day,The Centre Of My Little World,TRTKDGZ128F427F17C,1988,"When I saw you getting off the bus,
I knew this whole wide world was made for us.
And the first time that I spoke to you,
I was so shy I didn't know what to do.
But you said ""Take my hand, let's run away"",
I said ""I understand, let's leave today.""
So hey there little girl, you know you really got me in a whirl.
Hey there little girl, you are the centre of my little world.

When I saw you with another guy,
I turned away from you, I don't know why.
I always thought you were so true to me,
Oh, but now it seems you disagree.
So baby come back soon, come back today,
Just so that forever I can say that,
Hey there little girl, you know you really got me in a whirl.
Hey there little girl, you are the centre of my little world.

So baby come back soon, come back today,
Just so that forever I can say that,
Hey there little girl, you know you really got me in a whirl.
Hey there little girl, you're still the centre of my little world.
Hey there little girl, you know you really got me in a whirl.
Hey there little girl, you're still the centre of my whole wide world."
7,Oingo Boingo,Mama,TRSPWWR128F1467392,1988,"Mama 
Please be good— Please be good to me 
Mama 
Please be good— Please be good to me 
Mama
Hovering over me at night 
Mama
Comfort me; make me feel all right 

I walk alone and see what boys should never 
See in their lifetime 
I live in the world of spirits 
And I talk to the walls 
Deliver me from 
This little hell 
Deliver me from 
This little hell 
Deliver me from 

Mama
Come and take— Come and take my hand
Mama 
Try and see; try to understand 
Mama 
Looking through— Looking through my eyes 
Mama 
Everywhere, always in disguise 

I walk alone and see what boys should never 
See in their lifetime 
I live in the world of spirits 
And I talk to the walls 
Deliver me from 
This little hell 

Mama 
Please be good— Please be good to me 
Mama 
Please be good— Please be good to me 

I walk alone and see what boys should never see 
I hear what boys should never hear 
In their lifetime

I live in the world of spirits 
And I talk to the walls 
Deliver me from 
This little hell 
Deliver me from 
This little hell 
Deliver me from 

Mama 
Please be good...."
8,Enya,On Your Shore,TREUGGF128F1453A96,1988,"Strange how
My heart beats
To find myself upon your shore.
Strange how
I still feel
My loss of comfort gone before.

Cool waves wash over
And drift away with dreams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough.

And so
This is where I should be now
Days and nights falling by

Days and nights falling by me.
I know
Of a dream I should be holding
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me.

Soft blue horizons
Reach far into my childhood days
As you are rising
To bring me my forgotten ways.

Strange how I falter
To find I'm standing in deep water
Strange how
My heart beats
To find I'm standing on your shore."
9,Tracie Spencer,Because Of You,TRYUZAB128F1457373,1988,"Your love goes with me
It surrounds me everywhere that I go
No matter where you are
Your heart is here with me

I wanna tell you that I'm with you tonight
Though you're not here
I can see that lovely smile on your face
And feel the touch of you and know I'm missing you
I'll make it true one more day

Because of you, there is nothing I can't do
And each test life puts me through
I'll get by because of you, because of you

You make love easy
You take pleasure in each thing that I do
You give unselfishly
And the gift you gave is you

I'm gonna dedicate the rest of my life giving back to you
All the trust and faith that you've given me
I've learned so much from you to show my gratitude
I'll be the best for you I can be

Because of you, there is nothing I can't do
And each test life puts me through
I'll get by because of you

With you on my side, I am free to try and fly
Every mountain I can find
I have seen love at each day because of you
Because of you

Mama, I wanna thank you for all the wonderful things you do
For being there whenever I needed you
With the love that would last forever
And mama, I'm away from you now
But never, never in my heart

Because of you, there is nothing I can't do
And each test life puts me through
I'll get by because of you, because of you

With you by my side"
10,Sade,Clean Heart,TRBLPUK128F42597AB,1988,"Clean heart
Clean and sharp
Clean dream
Bad start

He loved his brother and his sister
Luke and tony called him mister
They made him feel much more
Like a man
He loved his daddy though he never told him
And how he loved his mother
He loved
He loved her like an italian

Little janet said you look so fine
So fine
Something in his smile
Made them feel like strangers
And then he straightened his belt
With a lover's touch
And he said i'm gonna bring home
The things that are out of your clutch

Seemed like the hottest night in summer
A heat that makes you feel like dying

Somewhere in the next block
There was a baby crying

Finger on the trigger for the years to come

And as the moon slid up over the restless streets
Sirens mocking and people stop to see
Their greedy eyes don't realise
He's someone's son
Finger on the trigger for the years to come

Finger on the trigger for the years to come"
11,Bangles,Complicated Girl,TRJMEIU128F427357F,1988,"Valerie is beautiful
But she seems a little bit confused
The life you offer her she says she cannot use

You live in another world
She thinks she won't fit in
And oh, what about her plans for him
She bends to his will

Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girl

You call her on the phone
She's got the other guy on hold
You see the scene unfold
You know it very well

Stay inside your room all day
When she doesn't call you pull the shades
Never seen you act this way
The girl has hit you hard

Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girl

Why bother making rules
You know she will not follow
Someday she'll find a way to remedy
This lovely mess she's made of you

Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girl"
12,Riot,Bloodstreets,TRRPFNJ12903CECB54,1988,"I was born on these Streets years ago I was the king
of the neighbourhoood Fast on my feet i was elite
I was the star of the show This task must be done - i will
not run I will not lay me down to die This war i will win
so let it begin Deep in my heart is a burning fire... I can't
let it go Alone in the night I know i must fight for my
home Time has changed the seasons And i will go on
with no reason I feel my life slipping away These streets
are getting colder And i am growing older Tomorrow
seems so far away What's become of us friend we were
one til the end Now i'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names but nothing's the same The
places i played have forgotten the dream I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know i must fight for my home Time
has changed the seasons And i will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away These streets are getting
colder And i am growing older Tomorrow seems so far
away"
13,The Breeders,When I Was A Painter,TRJWWKQ128F14787E1,1988,"Inside legs of corduroy I've been 
Heard stories of air velveteen 
Twenty hours later I fill the room 
With bad sex and bad TV 

Go, go, go 
Go, go, go 

When I was a painter I painted you well 
Too bad I have to die 
You brought the essentials, perversion appeal 
And many lovers at one time 

Go, go, go 
Go, go, go 
On and on, on, on 

Inside legs of corduroy I've been 
Heard stories of air velveteen 
Twenty hours later I fill the room 
With bad sex and bad TV 

Go, go, go 
Go, go, go 
On and on, on, on"
14,Martika,More Than You Know,TREKGQS128F92DF860,1988,"If there's a fire in my eyes
It should come as no surprise to you
If I've shown you once or twice
How I feel it's because it's the truth
(You know that it's true)

Wanted to tell you so many times
How I feel when you're with me
Now that I found you
I know that you are my destiny

I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go
I'm afraid to show it
'Cuz I don't wanna blow it
I love you more than you know

You know you've got me hypnotized
But that's something I should hide from you
If I feel so mesmerized
It's because of the things that you do
(The things that you do)

I only wish I could read your mind
So I'd know just how you feel
Send me a signal
Tell me your feelings are just as real

I don't mean to put you under pressure
But it's something that I can't control
And though I'd give you the world if I could
I'm afraid to let you know
'Cuz I don't wanna lose your love"
15,Robben Ford,Can't Let Her Go (Album Version),TRCVHNV12903CC51A0,1988,"Careless since the day, I remember
Pictures come from heart to mind
Standing at your doorway searching all of my love
No, I'll never treat you unkind

Standing on your balcony
Speaking words of love
Telling you can easily
To push me down to shore

But I can't let her go
Can't let her go
No, I can't let her go
It's hard to let her go

There were lot of lights with the ceiling
You got to know it very well
Every single inch of this lonely room
Has the same old story to tell

Trouble comes to paradise
And nothing seems to fit
Playing games and telling lies
And so I just can't quit

No, I can't let her go
Can't let her go
No, I can't let her go
It's hard to let her go

Now that I found you, I'll never be the same
Now that it's over, now that it's over

Can't let her go
Can't let her go
No, I can't let her go

Can't let her go
Can't let her go
Hard to let her go
Can't let her go
Hard to let her go"
16,Soda Stereo,El Ritmo De Tus Ojos,TRLSZBS128F933AB68,1988,"Muéstrame tu cruz
el ritmo de tus ojos
sos parte del imán
que me aleja de este mundo

Aquí no queda nada en pie
como un castigo

Muéstrame tu soul
y el ritmo de tus ojos
el amor no es tan certero no
como este tiempo hipnótico

Algún consuelo debe haber
algún abrigo
te doy palabras de placer
hablarte sucio al oído...

Tienes el cóctel que envenenara
mi soledad

un flash sobre tu rouge
y el ritmo de tus ojos
impulso homicida
escena repetida

Aquí no queda nada en pie
como un castigo

Tienes el cóctel que envenenara
mi soledad

Estoy solo y con mis botas llenas de lluvia
y vos bailando con las medias hasta la rodilla
todo es una veloz película muda
se cuando mientes se cuando dudas

Tienes el cóctel que envenenara
mi soledad
tienes el cóctel que envenenara
y es el ritmo de tus ojos"
17,Timbuk 3,Welcome To The Human Race,TREEKKS128F148931A,1988,"So it seems you been runnin' in circles
Now you can't even get to first base
And you feel like the tide has turned against you
Welcome to the human race
So you feel like the gods are out to get you
You feel like you've fallen from grace
And you'd run again if they'd only let you
 
Welcome to the human race
Welcome to the human race
 
So your prophets of finance have fallen
On their collective proverbial face
And you hear muffled voices callin'
Welcome to the human race
You made a killin' dealin' real estate at NASA
Sellin' cemetery plots in outer space
Til some fallin' coffins crashed upon your doorstep
 
Welcome to the human race
Welcome to the human race
Open up your heart
 
So you sold your ocean home ain't that a pity
And your mermaids disappeared without a trace
Now you comb the streets of sandcastle city
Welcome to the human race
Now sometimes the truth is hard to handle
But lately it's much easier to face
We'll just write it off as just another scandal
 
Welcome to the human race
Welcome to the human race
Welcome to the human race
Open up your heart"
18,Slick Rick,The Ruler's Back,TRUMBND128F148D409,1988,"Hauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
Its a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause its really a small thing
But they're bitin what I'm writin
God it's great being the king
Some sound allright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his cloggy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
the Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back"

A thousand hearts, a million miles of dreams and thoughts of you

All right
I'm a-comin' for you, well
All we need, we need is a dream
All we neeed is a night

All we need is one night

All we need...
Hello, hello

That you know who needs someone 
To help you make it through"
20,The Balancing Act,We're Not Lost,TRXLGCL128F9342DE1,1988,"In the morning we check our shoes
In the morning we shake out scorpions

Check for pit snakes
Under jeep seats

We're not lost
We're meant to be here
And we hope
The Rain will stop

I could wait
A hundred years
And walk a hundred roads untravelled

To find the place
Where my true love waits

We're not lost
We're meant to be here
And we hope
The Rain will stop"
21,Dinah Shore,Doin' What Comes Natur'lly,TRIPPBE128F426BEE4,1988,"Folks are dumb,
Where I come from,
They ain't had any learnin'
Still, they're happy as can be,
Doin' what comes naturally.

Folks like us, 
Could never fuss,
With schools and books and learnin',
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally.

You don't have to know,
How to read or write,
When you're out with a feller,
In the pale moonligt,
You don't have to look,
At a book to find,
What he thinks of the moon,
And what is on his mind,
That comes naturally.

My uncle out in Texas,
Can't even write his name,
He signs his checks with ""X's"",
But they cash 'em just the same.
If you saw my Paw and Maw,
You'd know they had no learnin',
Still they raised a family,
Doin' what comes naturally,
Doin' what comes naturally!"
22,Peter Cetera,Holding Out (Album Version),TRLTMSY128E078736A,1988,"There's nothing outside my window
But the sound of the pouring rain
It oughta be breaking my heart
But I feel no pain 
Trying to pick up the station
That'll carry me through this night
Got a fire to keep me warm
'Til I got you in my arms 

Holding out, dug in deep
I got an island that I'm gonna keep
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep
Holding out
Oh yeah
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out 

Girl, I've been dreaming about you
For the better part of my life
At least I can make it without you
One more night 

I'm not afraid of the thunder
I won't run away from the storm
Let the stars fall down and break
I don't care how long it takes 

Holding out, dug in deep
I got an island that I'm gonna keep
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep
Holding out
Oh yeah
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out 

There's no other love in the world
I could want any more 

Holding out, dug in deep
I got an island that I'm gonna keep
Close my eyes but I know I won't sleep
Holding out
Oh yeah
I know love won't forget me, I gotta keep holding out"
23,Danny Kaye,The Ugly Duckling,TRBNENQ128F931CC59,1988,"There once was an ugly duckling
With feathers all stubby and brown
And the other birds in so many words
Said get out of town
Get out, get out, get out of town
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack
In a flurry of eiderdown

That poor little ugly duckling
Went wandering far and near
But at every place they said to his face
Now get out of here
Get out, get out, get out of here
And he went with a quack and a waddle and a quack
And a very unhappy tear

All through the wintertime he hid himself away
Ashamed to show his face, afraid of what others might say
All through the winter in his lonely clump of weed
'Till a flock of swans spied him there and very soon agreed
""You're a very fine swan, indeed!""

""A swan? Me, a swan? Aw, go on!""
And he said, ""Yes, you're a swan.
Take a look at yourself in the lake and you'll see.""
And he looked, and he saw, and he said,
""I am a swan! Wheeeeeeeee!""

I'm not such an ugly duckling
No feathers all stubby and brown
For in fact these birds in so many words
Said the best in town
The best, the best, the best in town
Not a quack, not a quack, not a waddle or a quack
But a glide and a whistle and a snowy white back
And a head so noble and high
Say, who's an ugly duckling?
Not I!

Not I!"

But darling, don't be blue

Don't cry
Oh honey, please, don't be that way
Clouds in the sky
Should never make you feel that way

The rain
Will bring the violets of May
Tears are in vain
So honey, please, don't be that way

As long as we
See it through
You'll have me
I'll have you

Don't break my heart
Oh honey, please don't be that way"

Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Love...love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No...I can't let you go...

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart

Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name"

I dreamed of Alaska so far away
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glasciers
Somehow I knew that I'd live there one day

Well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move
And I felt like loser but I turned out the winner
When I came to Alaska the land that I love

Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me

I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna
Raised in hard times but I had a good life
From the first time I flew with my father a singin'
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilots wife

We sleep near the sound of a slow running river
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain
And we face every day like the first or the last one
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain

Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me

Oh for a fire on a cold winters night
And once more to gaze at the great Northernlights
For all of the beauty my children will see
Heres to Alaska and me

Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me"

Creating an unwelcome question mark

Mostly over a town of patterns

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and doom ray back to the moon

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and interfere with my daydream.

Good god it all swapped here

The stars must have swapped positions

Creating a sense of rearrangement

Mostly over a town of patterns.

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and doom ray back to the moon.

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and interfere with my daydream.

Will you be caught with your pants down and get all these things done?

Will you be caught with your pants down and move on a step or two?

Will you be caught with your pants down?

I never listened to a coo-coo vigor

And reaffirm what we're following,

Is nothing but whats at the end

Of our rainbow noses.

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and doom ray back to the moon.

Just waiting for the planet to reflect and interfere with my daydream.

Will you be caught with your pants down and move on a step or two?

Will you be caught with your pants down and get all these things done?

Will you be caught with your pants down and move on a step or two?

(Music: Truglio)

When far futures calling and your needs at hand
I'll be your creation, with you I'm hand in hand
Since my automation I've learned to think for man
Now you're not able to shut down my master plan

Once you'd crowd around me, marvel young and old
our machine brings us peace, now we are one and bold
Who'd think that perhaps 
your trust would soon collapse?
Life and death as a whole under machines control

(Pre chorus)
Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies

Minds of known construction please unite as one
Or taste our own destruction 
in the hands of what we've done
While you point and blame 
at who first turned my switch
I plan feats of terror to unthread you stitch by stitch

(Repeat pre chorus)

(Chorus)
Power and depth, infinity
Master Control, machinery
Complex and endless, infinity
Master Control, machinery
Pulse of pure metal, infinity
Master Control, machinery

Now retaliation, we are face to face
I submerge each nation, reveal my newest race
The thrill of revelation, my arms out of hand
And all your sins remembered to test machine and man

(Repeat pre chorus)

(Repeat chorus)

Upon the day of our people are weak and astray
This selfish destiny with man to lead the way
When far futures calling mankind can't play the fool
Don't leave our distant children 
a world unfair and cruel

Plus aveugles que moi dans tous les âges
Mais faut dire que je m'étais creuvé les yeux
En regardant de trop près son corsage

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Le ciel l'avait pourvue des mille appas
Qui vous font prendre feu dès qu'on y touche
L'en avait tant que je ne savais pas
Ne savais plus où donner de la bouche

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Elle n'avait pas de tête, elle n'avait pas
L'esprit beaucoup plus grand qu'un dé à coudre
Mais pour l'amour on ne demande pas
Aux filles d'avoir inventé la poudre

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur

Puis un jour elle a pris la clef des champs
En me laissant à l'âme un mal funeste
Et toutes les herbes de la Saint-Jean
N'ont pas pu me guérir de cette peste

Je lui en ai bien voulu, mais à présent
J'ai plus d'rancune et mon cœur lui pardonne
D'avoir mis mon cœur à feu et à sang
Pour qu'il ne puisse plus servir à personne

Une jolie fleur dans une peau d'vache
Une jolie vache déguisée en fleur
Qui fait la belle et qui vous attache
Puis, qui vous mène par le bout du cœur"

The man in the moon is my man
The man in the moon is my love caravan
He'll never break my heart, I know he's here to stay
Tell all the other boys to go away

He's always dressed properly
He's always where I can see him
He's always there when I need him

The man in the moon's got the stylin' flat
His dinner guest include the sun and saturn
The cow jumps over, he knows all the astronauts
I would be a space case if it were not for the man in the moon
For the man in the moon

He's always there when I need him

The man in the moon's my cosmic high
The man in the moon's a pearl of a guy
I trust him on venus, he's not the cheatin' type

Those hazy amber days
We were but children
Having the time of our lives
We had no regard, no respect
A floor was a bed
And a bed held the mysteries of life

They had to end
But so soon?
And to sit in the dark
Of my lonely room
Made it all seem so cruelly real
Say no goodbyes, no regrets
For the things that we said
How we said
That we only wanted an answer
To our dreams
We wanted an answer to our dreams

Ignorance is bliss
When adulthood we can resist
To embrace the years with grace
What a waste
What a waste

The fun we had
The fun we'll have
Reckless immaturity
For stars we are
And stars we'll be
Just you and me
For stars we are
And stars we'll be
Just you and me"

His song's too blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry

Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry"

I don't know what this world is coming to!

Yes - the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause - I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer - where you never been I'm in
You want stylin' - you know it's time again
D the enemy - tellin you to hear it
They praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, the show
Bum rush the sound I made a year ago
I guess you know - you guess I'm just a radical
Not a sabbatical - yes to make it critical
The only part your body should be parting to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Radio - suckers never play me
On the mix - just O.K. me
Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
Snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns
Hard - my calling card
Recorded and orderd - supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kickin' live next poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
Flavor - a rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime

Terminator X

From a rebel it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll comin' like a rhino
Tables turn - suckers burn to learn
They can't dis-able the power of my label
Def Jam - tells you who I am
The enemy's public - they really give a damn
Strong Island - where I got 'em wild and
That's the reason they're claimin' that I'm violent
Never silent - no dope gettin' dumb nope
Claimin' where we get our rhythm from
Number one - we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun - and still never on the run
You wanna be an S.1 - Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come - you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president - pullin' out the ray-gun
Zap the next one - I could be you're Sho-gun
Suckers - don't last a minute
Soft and smooth - I ain't with it
Hardcore - rawbone like a razor
I'm like a lazer - I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya - so this will faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playin' the role I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth - no what I am
Rough - cause I'm the man

No matter what the name - we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
Yeah - the voice of power
Is in the house - go take a shower boy
P.E. a group, a crew - not singular
We were black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers
You can't angle us - I know you're listenin'
I caught you pissin' in you're pants
You're scared of us dissin' us
The crowd is missin' us
We're on a mission boy

Terminator X

Attitude - when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose - electric wire
Simple and plain - give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
See the car keys - you'll never get these
They belong to the 98 posse
You want some more son - you wanna get some
Rush the door on a store - pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind - Boys
Bring the noise - my time
Step aside for the flex - Terminator X"

The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me

I believe in these people, I believe in this age
Though I hear about torment in lives lonely page
Yet still we walk strong, we'll remember we're free
For the truth we are given, for what we believe

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me, oh

I have searched out the answers to the mysteries, the laws
Though still I find barriers, yet still I would fall
But I still struggle on the truth that I seek
But I must remain strong for the lonely, the weak, the weak, the old

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other
The more you mean to me, older we get

The older we get, the farther we see
The more we mean to each other

Shock the colours to bleach inside

To spin the gold and silver stitches

Thro' shoe black smile he'll tell-a-tale
Come whisper thro' your lips of straw
A moment torn forevermore

To spin the gold and silver stitches

How I long to see your face
Photographed in fifteen second intervals
In a bank in San Leandro
A Polaroid of you, Cinque
With a seven-headed dragon
In a house in Daly City
Don't be sad, my beloved Tania
They say your father never liked Stephen Weed anyway
Hired a detective
To follow him around
Oh, my beloved revolutionary sweetheart
I can see your newsprint face turn yellow in the gutter
It makes me sad
How I long for the days when you came to liberate us from boredom
From driving around from five to seven in the evening
My beloved Tania,
We carry your gun deep within our hearts
For no better reason than our lives have no meaning
And we want to be on television"

53,Marc Almond,She Took My Soul In Istanbul,TRUAAUZ128E07814AC,1988,"Once in a night
I spent in Istanbul
I had a dream of a forbidden world
Where even angels
Fear to look upon
A place where all of love is doomed to die

Her face appeared
Through clouds of bitter wine
Sour as the morning's early hours
She took my hair
And she curled it around
Her fingers
I was but a fool for love

The scent of Turkish oils
Mixed with the harsh tobacco
In the overcrowded bar
Hashish
And cool mint in her hair
I was a fool for love
I was a fool

She sang to me
A torch song softly laced
With mysteries Arabian
It poisoned my mind
A sickness in my soul
I tried
I didn't want to hear at all

A curtain fell
Before my eyes I did
Succumb into her healing breast
She sang that song
I gave her all my soul
And my all
To the pleasures of the flesh

I cried that night
For those forsaken times
Those times when I was
Simply satisfied
I turned to dust
That night a thousand times
That night a thousand times I died inside
And through what's left
Of my sad life I hear
Her singing in the fevers of the night

Look into the mirror of my eyes
And tell me what you see
It's not your love I need
You'll see
Sorrow, tears and darkness
These are the pleasures
Beyond your dreams

I found myself
Down by the sea
A hundred years ago
When I was in my teens
And years go by
I turned into a man
My childhood trapped within the sand
I crawled through life
On broken glass through hell
It seems I wakened my desires
And woke one day
Wet with the sweat of fear
Wet with the sweat of fear
As now with you

I'll reveal your mother
Come to me
I'll take you to the safety of the womb
Tell me your secrets
Sorrow tears and darkness
Pour out your heart
Sorrow tears and darkness

You'll be a fool
A fool for love

And hell had never seemed so good
As when I lost my soul
Became a fool for love

Help me, please to find my way
Look into the mirror of my eyes
Your kiss has clouded up my mind
And tell me what you see
I was a fool, a fool for love
It's not your love I need
I cried for those forsaken times
You'll see
She took my soul in Istanbul
Sorrow tears and darkness
She left me on that night to die
These are the pleasures beyond your dreams
These are the pleasures beyond all my dreams

I am lost
Help me to find my way
Here in a world where angels fear to gaze
My love is doomed to die
Alone tonight in Istanbul
And I a fool
For
Love"

To keep bad luck away from me

After a while it sank after being afloat
Few years ago I went to holydays on Tenerife
Leaving there people full of grief
Goodluck never stays a day
Bad luck's always coming my way

I'm even worse than a tornado, whirlwind, hurricane
Even my looks make ordinary people go insane
When they put me away in a bunker of ferro-concrete
My misery radiation made it crash completely

Where is the cause of unity

Men gathered in silence the same

Can there be some peace on earth
Can there be a love

Greater than us all

Hit it
Excuse me
What?
Can I have your attention?
Mn-hmm
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
They'll come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you
As sure as Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust not girl unless she feels the same
Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Tell all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid
It's not your child
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him

Treat 'em like a prostitue (Do What?)
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well until 
you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

It's your wife
You buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you, ""The bith dont' deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Home from work early, Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out
Bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself, she might still be loyal
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party
from work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say, ""Where the fuck are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well until 
you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my third example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
Today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says, ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles
And you call her Rover
Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill
She says, ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours-who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Treat 'em like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well
Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop"

In the factories our own hands have built
Where we must work twice the graft
Before gaining the goods we've already slogged to create

To consume all things material
Stands above human compassion
As we compete with our fellow man
In the bid for a stronger position

In our ruthless search for prosperity
We become the tools of our own oppression
Forming the backbone of a society
That thrives on mass division

From enslavement
To obliteration."

We have been created
Living text of written Word
Mercy demonstrated
We are made a channel
Where His grace is poured
Witness of Salvation
For the Glory of the Lord
For the Glory of the Lord

For the Glory of the Lord
Willingly, we suffer
Laid upon this Holy Cross
Dying with our Brother
His Divine Fulfillment
Our complete reward
Crucified rejoicing
For the Glory of the Lord
For the Glory of the Lord

For the Glory of the Lord
We advance united
Following Christ's blazing sword
His Dominion sighted
All that has been taken
It shall be restored
This eternal anthem
For the Glory of the Lord
For the Glory of the Lord

For the Glory of the Lord
For the Glory of the Lord"
67,Karyn White,Family Man (LP Version),TRHYIMY128F93412BF,1988,"Yesterday you told me that you love me and you love me for good
You said that we'll get married when the time was right and I understood

But how long
Were you planning to deceive me? Love me and then leave me
How long will
You pull the wool all over my eyes?

Wish you had told me you were a family man
'Cause if you had told me I would have made other plans

It wasn't very long ago you promised me that we'd go away
Told me to be patient, you say good things come to those who can wait

How long
Will you play with my emotions, treat me like a token?
How long
Must you play your silly games with my heart?

I wish you had told me you were a family man
'Cause if you had told me I would have made other plans

I wish you had told me you were a family man
I'm walking out that door
'Cause if you had told me I would have made other plans
You don't call around no more
I would have made other plans

Please, I've had enough of this mess
Baby, oh, how long?
How long?

How long
Will you play with my emotions, treat my like a token?
How long
Must you play your silly games with my heart?

I wish you had told me you were a family man
'Cause if you had told me I would have made other plans

I wish you had told me you were a family man
'Cause if you had told me I would have made other plans

I know it just ain't right to your children and your wife
And all your love's an alibi For mixing up my life
How do I love you like I do, I do have perfect faith in you
How could I be so blind and let you play me, play me for a fool

I wish you hadn told me you were a family man
'Cause if you would had told me I would have made other plans"

Another gambit-he would have made her
He gave her perfume-she used his razor
And decided to change his ways
She was a gambler-he didn't blame her;
She had a dimple in her favour
At the last minute, he always chased her
And decided to change his ways
Life would be so much more exciting
If we could live it day to day
We could at least adjust the lighting
To illuminate the way
He took the loving that she'd been craving
She took advantage of the saving;
It almost ruin her reputation
And decided to change his ways
She wasn't crazy 'bout his behaviour;
She read it somewhere in the paper;
He was seducing a ballerina
And decided to change his ways"

Ou então vai me matar

Fadas sensuais
Me vigiam do décimo andar

Tem sempre um lugar
Aonde você não está

Paro no meio da noite (da noite)
Procuro a tua mão
Você está tão distante (distante)
Num sonho que eu nem sei

O pensamento é a guerra
A guerra civil do ser
Entro no teu corpo
Quero te conhecer

Tem sempre um lugar
Onde você não está

Paro no meio de tudo

Complicated potatoes again?

82,Kreator,Awakening of the gods (live),TRSPDWW128F92EFB18,1988,"Was it a vision or was it a dream
The trust of the mankind has never been real
Gods of pleasure gods of pain
Gods of terror of life and of hate
Mortality is endless when gods start to pray
Life becomes worthless by nuclear death
The're watching from above it could happen every daywatching their terror and
care in no way
No one can imagine where you will be
Where you have been before your birth you will see
Planned and controlled is your life in every way
Watched and controlled on every single day

See their eyes filled with lies
Watch the slaughter endless night
Can make your scream can make you cry
You know you're helpless till the end of time
Awakening of the gods

Burning ambitions your lusts and your wills
Your plans of life goals and your thrills
Days of laughter days of crime your living to your fate on foretold time
Nothin' has worth nothing is real nothing is important no way you
Feel this can't be the only life it could begin when you die

See their eyes...

Manipulated by human feelings
You're passing through this life searching for the meaning of all
But that's something you will never find
Accept all what happens to you
Be prepared for torture and pain you know there ain't nothing
You can do only death will close the reign

You've seen the good sides but you've also seen the bad
Damned to mortality damned is your life for death
Created for a mystery why is this your fate
Only the future will show
Or maybe you will never know"

What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

Well, I'm the guy who never learned to dance
Never even got one second glance
Across a crowded room was close enough
I could look but I could never touch

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
""How did I ever win your love?""
What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

Don't anyone wake me
If it's just a dream
'Cause she's the best thing
Ever happened to me

All you fellows
You can look all you like
But this girl you see
She's leavin' here with me tonight

There's just one more thing that I need to know
If this is love why does it scare me so?
It must be somethin' only you can see
'Cause girl I feel it when you look at me

So tonight I'll ask the stars above
""How did I ever win your love?""
What did I do
What did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way? 
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, awww"

No words to convey
This feeling inside I have for you
Deep in my heart
Safe from the guards
Of intellect and reason
Leaving me at a loss
For words to express my feelings
Deep in my heart

Look at me losing control
Thinking I had a hold
But with feelings this strong
I'm no longer the master
Of my emotions"
85,Boogie Down Productions,Poetry #3,TRCYZPJ12903CDB556,1988,"Verse One: KRS-One

Well now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session so you can stop guessin
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
Listen, I'm not dissin but there's somethin that you're missin
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishin
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teachin
a class, or rather school, cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me
They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
Cause yo I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now ... thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man
That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy far from reality
Poetry is the language of imagination
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Difficult, isn't it?  The point?  You're missin it
Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissin it

Verse Two: KRS-One

Scott LaRock is innovating, decorating hip-hop
The beat may drop but not like all the others
They just cover while I just smother
Every single stupid mutha -- wait wait brotha
KRS-One will have to show another
MC or self-proclaimed king or queen
Or gang or crew or solo or team
That I mean
Business
So tell me what is this?
See I come from the Bronx so just kiss this
Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment
The antidote for sucka MC's and they're fearin it
It's self-explanatory, no one's writin for me
The poetry I'm rattlin is really not for battlin
But if you want I will simply change the program
So when I'm done you will simply say ""damn""
So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove somethin
I say hypothetical because it's only theory
My theory, so take a minute now to hear me

Verse Three: KRS-One

So what's your problem?
It seems you want to be KRS-Two
From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack
Cos KRS-One means simply one KRS
That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less
I've built up my credential financially and mental
Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental
I speak clearly and that's merely
Or should I say a mere, help to my career
I'm really not into fashion or craze
Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise
You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy
Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
But what a pity, I'm rockin New York City
And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf
You as an amateur is outspoken
I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hopin
That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up
But everything's live that's why I don't dress up
""Blastmaster KRS"" a synonym for ""fresh""
I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test
Got DJ Scott LaRock by my side, not in back of me
Cos we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty
Get it right, or train yourself not to bite
Cos when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it
I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it

I'm teaching poetry
I'm teaching poetry
Scott LaRock
We're teaching po-e-try"

I thought your name was good for you

Because you're sweet and smart and wild

There's a guy who lives in Albarn
His name is Curly Carr
Each night he comes on down the street
A-packin' his guitar
Stops at Jelly Bean's house
That pretty little thing
Bounce his head and bends his knees
You ought to hear him sing

Chorus 
Jelly Bean comes through the window
And she listens for a while
Barely even blinks her eye
She's always in a smile
Tosses up a pretty curl
It turns to gold

Grabs his guitar one more time 
And sings his tale of old

Yeah that's my gal,

Vejo Cristo da janela

Nas filas dos pontos de ônibus 
Procurando aonde ir 
São todos seus cicerones 
Correm pra não desistir 
Dos seus salários de fome 
É a esperança que eles tem 
Neste filme como extras 
Todos querem se dar bem 

Num trem pras estrelas 
Depois dos navios negreiros 
Outras correntezas 

Estranho o teu Cristo, Rio 
Que olha tão longe, além 
Com os braços sempre abertos 
Mas sem protejer ninguém 
Eu vou forrar as paredes 
Do meu quarto de miséria 
Com manchetes de jornal 
Pra ver que não é nada sério 
Eu vou dar o meu desprezo 
Pra você que me ensinou 
Que a tristeza é uma maneira 
Da gente se salvar depois 

Num trem pras estrelas 
Depois dos navios negreiros 
Outras correntezas"

As-tu déjà oublié que ces mains ont tout donné?

Qui voudraient caresser
Un jour seront lassées
D'attendre ton retour

Mes mains
Elles iront te chercher
Là où tu t'es cachée
Avec un autre amour

Mes mains
Méprisant les prières
Trembleront de colère
Et je n'y pourrai rien

Pour toujours dans la nuit
Emporteront ta vie

To see you through?
In this broken town can you still jack in
And know what to do?
I remember our youth, our high ideals
I remember you were so uptight
That time in the trees, we broke that vice
We took some steps and now
We can't think twice

Tell me Joni, am I right by you?
Tell me how yr gonna lose this hard luck?
Hey Joni, when will all these dreams come true?
You'd better find a way
To climb down off that truck

Shots ring out from the center of an empty field
Joni's in the tall grass
She's a beautiful mental jukebox
A sailboat explosion
A snap of electric whipcrack

She's not thinking about the future
She's not spinning her wheels
She doesn't think at all about the past
She thinking long and hard
About that high wild sound
And wondering will it last?

Kick it

Hey Joni, put it all behind you
There's something turning, Joni, turning right to you
My head burns, but I know you'll speak the truth, hey
Hey Joni, put it all behind you
Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too
Forget the future
These times are such a mess
Tune out the past, and just say yes

It's 1963
It's 1964
It's 1957
It's 1962

Put it all behind you
Now it's all behind you"

The angel looked and nodded no, far be it that you should go
The throned one said why should I let you in, you said me good-bye
The human one said I don't know, but I’m not as bad as my friends below

(Bridge)
Why should I believe what you say
You destroyed your own life anyway
By not choosing, you've made your choice already
People don't make his mistake, you'll be sorry

(Chorus)
Break-out, the living dead,
Break-out forever
Break-out, the living dead,
Break-out of them forever, living dead

Make the kill between the eyes; the old man say good-bye
Shoot the arrow, kill the sin, give birth to life, get born again
Take the road of destiny that leads you past evil's tree
Drop the blade, no suicide can help you find a place to hide

(Bridge &amp; chorus)

Look in the sky and tell me what comes to your mind
Look in my eyes, are these, the eyes of disguise
They feet they can walk but their eyes cannot see
Their hearts made of lead, it's the living dead

Spin the wheel of chance, what did you win
But this is no game show you're starring in
Life's but a burning blade of grass
Before you know it earth will be your past
How can I believe just what you say
When you destroyed your own life anyway
Your phone was off the hook, I could not reach you
And your will was not at home, I never met you

Break-out, the living dead,
Break-out forever
Break-out, the living dead,
Break-out

Gouge the eyes out of a wounded man, good is shout, evil stands
Happiness is now a tale of long ago, the people failed
Meanwhile believers live in heaven's peace, the master gives
Take the book of life, he said, I don't allow the living dead"

Floating with the stream
The howling winds have gathered strength
From a wisper to a scream
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale

Head to Neptune's calling deceived in fable and lore
Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war
Searching for the stars
In an ocean of rain
The yearning of the raging sea beckons once again
Sell me down the river


And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale

Gathering of the storm
And the winds are blowing wild
Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child
Mother Nature cries for love
Her children lost at sea
And as the waves take me away
Say a prayer for liberty
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell

Eatin' dinner on the ground
Made of fresh caught catfish stew

Con qualche goccia di utopia
Ondeggiando danza qui con me nelle stanze immense dei perché
Mentre il mondo è un gioco d'apparenza
L'incoscienza ha volte non ha età e decide sempre a modo suo
Ma più scendi in fondo dentro te pedinando oscure verità
Più ti accorgi che la vita non ti ascolterà
Poi la sera scende sul tuo viaggio a cercare un uomo o forse un Dio
Sorridente forma senza idea
Disperatamente un allegria la tua faccia accesa di follia
Affamata cerca compagnia
Ed il nuovo corso par che sia la solitudine che non è mia
E il pianeta muore di silenzio respirando aborti di energia
Tra una pietra al collo ed un cioè
Dentro a una coscienza che non c'è
Auto a fari spenti nella via con la radio fuori sintonia
Conservo un pezzo di innocenza, una ben protetta ingenuità
Una zona franca di armonia dove non c'è posto per gli eroi
Dove il conto torna prima o poi
Dove l'universo siamo noi

La solitudine che non è mia."

You're anti, you're antisocial
How do you feel?

You're a train ride to no importance
You're in love with hell existence
Money is all that you desire
Why don't you pack it in and retire
It's common nature you can't fool me
I'm just the money that you can't let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Don't you realize the blind lead the blind

You're anti, you're antisocial
You're anti, you're antisocial
You're anti, you're antisocial
You're anti, you're antisocial

112,Boogie Down Productions,My Philosophy,TRFJFAS128F930FA57,1988,"Voice: So, you're a philosopher?
  KRS: Yes, I think very deeply.
  [repeated and scratched]

[Verse One]
Let's begin, what, where, why, or when
will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact, I'm kind of rational
when I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
pick the punk, and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
right up to your face and dis you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is my philosophy, many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
so please stop burnin, and learn to earn respect
'cause that's just what KR collects
see, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
you walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style, and learn to be original
and everybody's gonna wanna diss you
like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
and every sucka mc had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
my posse from the Bronx is thick
and we're real live, we walk correctly
a lot of suckas would like to forget me 
but they can't, cause like a champ
I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second
on the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I have juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just seckle!

[Verse Two]
I'll play the nine and you play the target
you all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
or should I say, ""Start this,"" I am an artist
of new concepts at their hardest
cause, yo, I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why  I walk with my head up
when I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
a lot of suckas with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black 
I'm brown.. from the Boogie Down
Productions, of course our music be thumpin'
others say their bad, but they're buggin
let me tell you somethin' now about hip hop
about D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
some mc's be talkin' and talkin'
tryin' to show how black people are walkin
but I don't walk this way to portray
or reinforce stereotypes of today
like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon
talk broken english and drug sellin'
See I'm tellin, and teaching real facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
and it lacks creativity and intelligence
but they don't care cause the company is sellin' it
It's my philosophy, on the industry
Don't bother dissin me, or even wish that we'd
soften, dilute, or commercialize all our lyrics
Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'cause to me that's suicide self-murder
let us get back to what we call hip hop
and what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock...

[Verse Three]
How many mc's must get dissed
before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""
this is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny - that's, Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
the lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher
It's not about a salary it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along  nor sing a song
'cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?!
So yo, what's up, it's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
We're criminal minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
no more than four minutes and some seconds
the competition checks and checks and keeps checkin'
they buy the album, take it home, and start sweatin'
why? well it's simple, to them it's kind of vital
to take KRS-One's title
to them I'm like an idol, some type of entity
in everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me?
or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock
but they can get bust get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around nor do I f*** around
and you can tell by the bodies that are left around
when some clown jumps up to get beat down
broken down to his very last compound
see how it sounds?  a little unrational
a lot of mc's like to use the word DRAMATICAL!
Fresh for '88, you suckas..."
113,Metallica,Dyers Eve,TREFNWD128F42BA130,1988,"Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learnt to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

I'm in Hell without you
Cannot cope without you too
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother, dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite, I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew

You"
114,Jesus And Mary Chain,Sidewalking,TRALCCC128E07964FB,1988,"Chilled to the bone and five miles to home
I'm messing in the dark and feeling all alone
I got ice in my fire got the heat in my wire
Inject a little heat I'm burning up the tyres

Sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking sidewalking

Talking like I'm on and I'm the only one
I'm making like I'm done and staring like a gun
And I gotta get a car and I gotta get a ride
Gotta get a car got jesus on my side

Alone in the streets I know just where I'm going

115,Helstar,Scorcher,TRJFGOV128F934B046,1988,"Far beyond the darkened sky, angels all riding high
Rising from the temple walls, time stands still when he calls
King of kings, ruler of all man
Come Claim your land
Lightning strikes your path, you've heard of the day
A distant thunder comes to take you away
Chariots of horses fill the sky
A voice like running waters, shouts the king am I

[Chorus:]
He's the scorcher in the sky
Pain and torture burning high

Scrolls unfold, disaster takes its course
A sun of blood repells its scorching force
Smoke of black closing in stops at nothing
Tribute for seven years and the never ending sting

[Chorus]

Stars are falling, now your in despair
Betrayed by those he died for his wrath you'll share
Days seem like years, he warned someday
You'd shed blood for tears

[Chorus]

He gave his hand, you turned your back
Too late to bargain, the shadows who ran in fear

[Solo]

Lightening struck your path, you heard of the day
A distant thunder came to take you away
Chariots of horses fill the sky, a voice like running
Waters shouted the king am I

Sit down and stooping
Put down and walking
Hesitate and waiting

To bend ... and to catch
To run ... and to step
To lay down and to take off
To draw ... and to fall

Fall behind, fall down and drouwn
Only be lying
Breathing time only for a melody
The skin on the cacao of your soul
Is yourself"
119,The Balancing Act,Whiskered Wife,TRJROFE128F9342DDA,1988,"We heard the story from his whiskered wife
As we sat around her in that dusky den
She told us how he lost his life
And ten years later picked it up again

He was carving marble in his dreams
And sleeping in an old septic shack
So he left his kingdom and he left his queen
I guess they still expect him back

This home is broken
No lights are on
There's someone hoping
Hope's not all gone

He started over somewhere later
Built another world in another town
She saw his picture in the paper
He face it wrinkled as they sat her down

All the good things are worth the wait
But an empty pocket and a burning shoe
Make it easier to just clean the slate
And what's a family but a bill that's due?

This home is broken
No lights are on
There's someone hoping
Hope's not all gone"

It passes overhead and all I can see
A silhouette of a nearby tree
Am I the only one throughout the land
Witnessing something so grand

Make believe
All I can see
Fantasy
A dream come true behold I say to you

Hang on Yellow Christian
Take the time to notice me
You're always in my heart
I've made it plain to see

A nearing light transposes the sky
God's own garden
People sheltered in their homes and houses
Thieves and fools and long travelled soldiers
A candid light approaches their homes
Human falter, people bellowed from their homes
And houses, thieves and fools and long reigning pharoes

Now I've seen all the glittering light
A peaceful warm december night
And I can say to my fellow men
Sure they'll reappear once again

Make believe
All I can see

A dream come true behold I say to you

After the mountains crumble
The stars and the moon and the sun all fade away

Oh when all your reasons for living have all but dissappeared


And when the boats you've been sailing you can no longer steer
There I will sail right behind you
On winds of love I sail
Cause I wanna be there with you

I can see a better way

So improperly dressed

Her umbrella is deep red
She holds it over both our heads
Though we could be warm in her bed
She walks me to the bus instead

She looks down and starts to cry

And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell ya how to spread it throughout my crew
Well, you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
Made the music ""Nobody Beats the Biz""
Well, check it
Back in the days before this began
He usually tried to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big trunk jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed
Talkin' about ""Nigger, please, you work for UPS""
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wears fly Valley boots
Rough leather fashions and tough silk suits
Now she stop frontin' an' wants to speak
And be comin' to all the shows 
Every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she'd be beggin' please
Dyin' for the day to get skeezed

She caught the vapors (4X)

I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
Back in the days, he was nothin' like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hangin' down and his sneakers untied
And a rasta-type Kango tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood, people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his mom's ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothin' but a hoodlum
Or either injail or someone would shoot him
But now he's grown up, to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record sellin' worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child be sayin'
Can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now

They caught the vapors (4X)

Now I got a cousin by the name of Von Lee
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts scratch, transform with finesse
...(cuts and scratches)...and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get his job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said, ""Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted""
Now my cousin Von still tried on and on and on
'Til the like break of dawn
To put this j-o-b in effect
But they'd look right past him and be like ""next""
Now for the year of '88
Cool V is makin' dollars so my cousin's like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss'll be like, ""Von, welcome to my store""
Offerin' him a job but naw, he don't want it
Damn it feels goo to see people up on it
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught from my cousin 
The vapors

They caught the vapors (4X)

Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down
With a lot of M.C.-deejayin' crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street, I say ""Can I be down, champ""
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After gettin' rejected, I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I'd have to beg to get on the mike and rap that day
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it
Instead of tryin' to use it
But now things switched without belief
""Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Nober Street, chief?
We used to be down back in the days""
It happens all the time and never ceases to amaze

They caught the vapors (4X)"
132,Marty Robbins,Cowboy In The Continental Suit,TRUTMLE12903CB878C,1988,"Well, he walks out in the arena
All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""
Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck
And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch
He came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the Buckskin
In a Continental Suit

Well, I turned around to look at Jim
And he was watchin' me
He said, ""I don't believe
The crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw
The one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy
In a Continental Suit""

""The Brute"" came to a stand-still
Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes
The stranger took his money
And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

The moral of this story:
Never judge by what they wear
Underneath some ragged clothes
Could be a millionaire
Everybody listen
Don't be fooled by this galoot
This sure-'nough bronc buster
In a Continental Suit"
133,Stetsasonic,Talkin' All That Jazz (Dominoes Vocal Remix By Daddy-O),TRYPVWQ128F42A654F,1988,"""Oh, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. I love Stetsasonic
So I'm talkin' 'bout samplin' records""
""Well, in that sase""

PUMP UP THE BASS!!

Well here's how it started
Heard you on the radio
Talkin' 'bout rap
Sayin' all that crap about how we sample
Given examples
Think we'll let you get away with that?
You criticize our method of how we make records
You said it wasn't art, so now we're gonna rip you apart
Stop, check it out my man
This is the music of a hip-hop band
Jazz, well you can call it that
But this jazz retains a new format
Point, where you misjudged us
Speculated, created a fuss
You've made the same mistake politicians have
Talkin' all that jazz

Talk, well I heard talk is cheap
But like beauty, talk is just skin deep
And when you lie and you talk a lot
People tell you to step off a lot
You see, you misunderstood
A sample is a tactic
A portion of my method, a tool
In fact it's only of importance when I make it a priority
And what we sample of, is the majority
But you are a minority, in terms of thought
Narrow minded and poorly taught
About hip-hop, playin' all the silly games
You erase my music, so no one can use it
Step on us and we'll step on you
Can't have your cake and eat it too
Talkin' all that jazz

Lies, that's when you hide the truth
It's when you talk more jazz than proof
And when you lie and address something you don't know
It's so whack that it's bound to show
When you lie about me and the band we get angry
We'll bite our pen, start writin' again
And the things we write are always true
Suckers, get a grip, now we talkin' 'bout you
Seems to me that you have a problem
So we can see what we can do to solve them
Think rap is a fad? you must be mad
'Cause we're so bad we get respect you never had
Tell the truth, James Brown was old
'Til Eric and Rakim came out with ""I Got Soul""
Rap brings back old R&amp;B
And if we would not, people could've forgot
We wanna make this perfectly clear
We're talented and strong and have no fear
Of those who choose to judge but lack pizazz
Talkin' all that jazz

Now we're not tryin' to be a boss to you
We just wanna get across to you
That if you're talkin' jazz, the situation is a no-win
You might even get hurt, my friend
Stetsasonic, the hip-hop band
Like Sly and the Family Stone, we will stand
Up for the music we live and play
And for the song we sing today
For now, let us set the record straight
And later on we'll have an informal and a formal debate
But it's important you remember, though
What you reap is what you sew
Talkin' all that jazz

Talkin' all that jazz
Talkin' all that jazz"

Shadows fall
The ocean calls to me
The night is still
She's where I wanna be

The stars all send
Their silver light to me
Forever shine
On me eternally

I couldn't think of anything
That gives me more than what you bring
The color of an endless dream
Let it shine
Let it shine

Here comes a burning fire
It fills me with desire
And all my troubles disappear

Feels like it's goin' through me
Whatever you do to me
Your words are magic to my ears
Woah, let it shine

A flame that grows and burns so deep in me
Somebody cries for all the world to see
Another time there will be ecstasy
Another place, you will be next to me

Of all the lives that I've been through
I never really thought it was true
That all I ever needed was you
Let it shine
Let it shine

Let it shine, oh let it shine
Let it shine, oh let it shine
Let it shine, oh let it shine
Let it shine, oh let it shine

There comes a burning fire
It fills me with desire
And all my troubles disappear

Feels like it's goin' through me
Whatever you do to me
Your words are magic to my ears

But when the sweet talkin's done""

Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' 'cross the trestle
Whoo-ee

A whoo-ee-duh whoo-ee
Ol' clickety clack's a echoin' back the blues
In the night

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
Yeah I've been in some big towns
And heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know

A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing the blues
In the night"

Say I look nice when I'm not
Touch my hair as you pass my chair
Little things mean a lot
Give me your arm as we cross the street
Call me at six on the dot
A line a day when you're far away
Little things mean a lot
Don't have to buy me diamonds or pearls
Champagne, sables, and such


I never cared much for diamonds and pearls
'cause honestly, honey, they just cost money
Give me a hand when I've lost the way
Give me your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is bright or gray
Give me your heart to rely on
Send me the warmth of a secret smile
To show me you haven't forgot
For now and forever, that's always and ever
Honey, little things mean a lot"

don't wait up for nobody

there's no victim but the willing

It's time to recognize
no one waits for the dead man
No one but the Lord of the Flies

or you'll lose your aim
You must be certain of the Devil right now.

Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God:
defend me from them that rise up against me.
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
and save me from bloody men.

Be not merciful to the wicked transgressors:
They run and prepare themselves without
my fault: awake to help me and behold:
They belch out with their mouths: swords
are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

But thou, O Lord, shall laugh at them.
The God of my mercy shall let me see
my desire upon mine enemies.

And at evening let them return, and let
them make a noise like a dog, and go round
about the city, let them walk up and down
for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.

Because of his strength I will wait upon thee:
for God is my defense. Scatter them by thy power and break
their teeth, O God, in their mouth:
BREAK OUT THE GREAT TEETH OF THE YOUNG LIONS, O LORD,
AND WHEN HE BENDETH HIS BOW TO SHOOT
HIS ARROWS, LET THEM BE CUT AS IN PEACES!
Bring them down, O Lord, our Shield.


You must bo certain of the Devil

You must be certain of the Devil
because he's counting on your shame
You must be certain of the Devil

You must be certain of the Devil

The good man is present on the Holy Day
The good man is ready on the HOLY Day
The good man is steady on the Holy Day
Welcome to the Holy Day.

The key to the city
is to the man who doesn't run
The key to the city
is to the man who takes a gun
The key to the city
is to the man who keeps his friend
and to the man who doesn't leave him till the end.

The road to the city is paved in desolation
The road to the city is paved in tribulation

The road to the city is paved in desperation
Welcome to the Holy Day.

The road to the city is paved in resignation
The road to the city is paved in desertion
The road to the city is paved in devotion

Welcome to the Holy Day.
Welcome to the Holy Day."

Climbing the walls not even knowing
What it was I had to find
Wondering if I ever would
There had to be some kind of something or someone
Who might bring out the best in me
Only the Greatest ever could
You (and You) caught my eye
With a glow too wonderful to ignore
(Better sight) I took
(In Your light) One look
(Shining down) Through heaven's door

I never thought I would ever
Stumble out of darkness and prize the view
But this time I found a gold mine in You, in You

Is this too much?
Hard to believe my life is changing, Lord
But now I've got Your touch
I gotta keep passin' it along
Down (deep down) in my heart
I knew there'd be someone like You someday

(Knowing You've) Steer me
(Chosen me) Just lead the way

I never thought I would ever
Stumble out of darkness and prize the view
But this time I found a gold mine in You, in You

I have to admit
I never thought I would ever
Chance upon a love I could hold on to
But this time I found a gold mine in You

I looked all around
I found a treasure no one can measure
But it's true
I can't begin to calculate my wealth

And I never thought I would ever
Stumble out of darkness and prize the view
But this time (I found) I found You
And finders are keepers

I never thought I would ever
Chance upon a love I could hold on to
I never thought I would ever
Spot a ray of hope in the residue
I never thought I would ever
Find another prospect to interview
But this time I found a gold mine in You

'Neath a starry sky

Carry across the landscape 

I hear it echo from every city to every village upon the earth 
From every rooftop to every mountain 
Calling the faithful to find themselves 
A fire burning like precious water, the fire that drives me on and on 

Through hell I shall reach heaven 
I shall not resist the changes before me 
View the madness with perspective 
(the clock is ticking but time means nothing) 
So I ascend to the blinding light 
Then plummet to the thickest darkness 
(and I always tell myself how splendid is the adventure!) 
I can no longer see good or evil 
But worship polarity 

So do not trust the beggars that expose their poverty of spirit 
Bleating ""I will follow"" 

I heed 
I heed the calling 
Follow yourselves as leaders 

Arise, arise, stand upright and take pride in who and what you are 
Great changes are coming and you will be asked to identify yourself 
So run like a lion with inexhaustible strength from world to world 
Let your work shine unto the ends of time yeah unto the ends of time."

Tenho uma lamparina
Que trouxe das arábias
Para te amar à luz do azeite
Num kama-sutra de noites sábias

Tenho junto ao psyché
Um grande cachimbo d'água

Fumamos ao cair da mágoa

Right now is all we need

We must find what you call sanctuary
It is kill or be killed
Only death from above sets us free

In the field of honor
In a zone that has no time
Where blood is thick as water
To murder is not a crime
One goal that we're headed for
To claim our victory
Attacks upon the land and shore
Men die endlessly

The poison we have tasted
Has blinded our minds
The cities devastated

Trained to kill one in his tracks

Secrets keep forever, they're undressing me
Come inside, it's warm in here
Better now to have no fear
Carried on a wave where we lead you

Touch your head then your hair
Softer, softer everywhere
Fingertips are burning, can I touch you there?
Soft as velvet, eyes can see
Bring me close to ecstasy
High away to heaven and I'm coming too

Don't you know
They're talkin' about a revolution
It sounds like a whisper

And finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution

Yes finally the tables are starting to turn
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no
Talkin' bout a revolution oh no"

Making time and living for the day
Burning bridges never made me cry
I could walk away with no goodbye
Easy take or easy leave them all
'Til you scratch the writing on the wall

It's on and off and on again
Going on and then
Taking all I got again
Bleeding me, leaving me dry
You're hanging on for what you can
Dragging out the pain
Taking all I give again
Faking it, making me cry

One day some day I may slide away
Turn around and call it all a day
Even though I've fooled myself for years
I can't escape this ringing in my ears

It's on and off and on again
Going on and then
Taking all I got again
Bleeding me, leaving me dry
You're hanging on for what you can
Dragging out the pain
Taking all I give again
Faking it, making me cry"

I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror

I cannot die

Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell"

And night turns into day
Rooms are empty I've got plenty
You could move in right away

Seems like there's a hole
In my dreams

Down through the heavens
Choke on the cotton clouds
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat

Looking down on me above
Send me home like an elephant stone
To smash my dream of love

And run run run away (run run run away)

And your midnight getaway

Yet nothing means anything

175,Melissa Etheridge,Don't You Need,TRUQVBB128F148D6E1,1988,"I had a dream 
Late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire
Burning my sky
My body was moving slow
And when I awoke 
I tasted the sweat 
Of desire on my mouth
And I realized, my heart 
Had abducted my mind

And they were last seen 
Headed south
Now I can't sleep 
I'm so wired
And I find myself 
Screaming out:

Don't you need? 
Don't you want?
Can't you taste it 
When you're alone?
Don't you cry? 
Don't you feel?
Sometimes I wonder 
If you are real
Don't you bleed?
Don't you need?

There's no quenching the thirst 
There's no relief
For the hungry at heart
And as far as you're concerned 
I'm just a thief
Entertaining in the dark
But it's you 
Who holds the cards
Now that the joker is wild

Don't you need? 
Don't you want?
Can't you taste it 
When you're alone?
Don't you cry? 
Don't you feel?
Sometimes I wonder 
If you are real
Don't you bleed?
Don't you need?

Don't you want 
To lay it down?
And feel your skin 
Against the ground?
Don't you want 
To ride the storm?
And then sleep 
Inside the calm?
Don't you want 
To get that high?
Don't you want 
To be satisfied?
Well, if you don't 
Want it from me
Don't you need

I had a dream 
Late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire 
Burning my sky
How was I to know
That I burn 
Every night in my dreams?
And only morning can set me free"

179,Jimmy Buffett,Homemade Music,TRIXJDB128F1467459,1988,"Homemade Music 
By: Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley, Russell Kunkel 
1988 
I ran into an old friend of mine in Miami and I asked her where she had been all these years. She told me she had, ""died and gone to the suburbs"". The next day I read where the Japanese had bought CBS Records and figured that somehow these two events had to be related. 
I ain't no video king 
I still have to sing 
For my supper each night 
You stand on the benches 
I play in the trenches 
Beneath the big spotlights 
Lived in a suitcase for half of my years 
I got strange little voices that live in my ears 
Hall monster, mall monster 
I can't be the old me no more 

Chorus: 
Homemade music ain't on the radio 
Homemade music searchin' high and low 
Homemade music where did all the good songs go 

Cookin' is a pleasure 
Singin' is a treasure 
That most don't find 
There ain't no harm in tellin' 
I likes to eat my melon 
Right on down to the rind 
I had a hippie girlfriend when I was a kid 
She died and went to the suburbs most of 'em did 
Raisin' puppies, having yuppies 
Where did all the wild ones go 

Chorus: 
Homemade music ain't on the radio 
Homemade music jam it in, close the door 
Homemade music where did all the good songs go 

First there were records then cassettes and CDs 
Managers and lawyers then came the Japanese 
But homemade music still making sense to me 
(sense to me, sense to me, sense to me) 

Chorus: 
Homemade music is funky and nice 
Homemade music skates on very thin ice 
Homemade music is part of my philosophy 

Chorus: 
Homemade music ain't on the radio 
Homemade music jam it in, close the door 
Homemade music where did all the good songs go 

Homemade music, give me my homemade music 
Homemade music, should be on the radio 

Don't dig that reg'lar bunk 
The Neville brothers got the funk 
And homemade music should be on the radio"

Und es ist als ob's wirklich passiert
Wie Technicolor und Dolby-Stereo
Ich wach auf und du sagst zu mir:

Du glotzt zu oft die Tagesschau
Das ist das übelste Programm das es gibt
Das bringt die Stimmung total auf null
Die ham jetzt langsam alles versiebt

Dann mach doch lieber die Augen zu
Mach doch lieber die Augen zu
Lieber die Augen zu
Mach doch lieber die Augen zu

Nehm ich'n Downer
Oder einfach 'n Bier
Long Run von den Eagles
Oder knutsche mit dir
Wir feiern ein Liebesfest
Und draussen ist Krieg
Wir vergessen, was um uns ist
Es gibt uns doch nur den Rest

Wir machen lieber die Augen zu

Trying your best to forget
It's all behind you, it's part of the past
You've got no time for regrets
Time to start over with somebody new
You've got nothing more to lose 
Out for the evening, dressed for the kill
Leaving your troubles behind
Dangerous places, dangerous times
Leave with the first one you find
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right
Who needs tomorrow, you've got tonight 

There in the dark, under covers of love
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go
First name the last thing that you need to know 

In the morning you're out on the street
Now's not the time for regrets
Some things are done for the thrill of it all
Some things you'll never forget
Live for the moment, who cares if it's right
Who needs tomorrow when you've got tonight 

There in the dark, under covers of love
Body language is taking you somewhere you shouldn't go
First name the last thing that you need to know"

Knee deep in fate - when what you want shows on your face

The clouds roll in across the moon
And the wind howls out your name

We never going to make that bridge tonight baby
Across Lake Ponchartrain

And it feels like rain

So batten down the hatch baby

And she's like a baby, just learning how to play.

She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.

Now, she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down.

Well, I know a lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust.

Now, she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down
Now she's a lady down on love..."

196,Newsboys,You're Still There (Read All About It Album Version),TRMSDJC128F14AE577,1988,"I lay on my bed
I try to sleep
my eyes won't close
my mind so deep

chorus
you're still there
you still care -
why do you draw me
you never left me

time after time I've tried to make it alone
I felt like my life was failure prone
but you're still there
you still care
- you wait and see, you cry for me
why do you draw me
you never left me

and when my life it has come to a close
I've run the good race and defeated my foes
you'll be there and you'll still care
you wait and see you cry for me
why did you draw me, you never left me
praise you"

198,The Wolfgang Press,Raintime,TRBUHFH128F423EFAD,1988,"Disturbing the old times, the gift of science 
Lots of back washing and sticks of paper 
Sticks of paper lighting the way 
If you find you don't know where your going 
It's in the bush, it's in the trees 
I'm gonna run round there twice 
It's too quick, it's too late 
It's much too quick and it's far too late 

I'm rolling away 
And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away for the last time 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
Too many things left unsaid 
And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away 
Somebody here is talking 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away, 
Somebody here is sober 

Somebody here is older 
Macbeth times 2 
A lazy suit and bloody hands 
Come taste your faith in every street 
The sound of money just kissed me in the face 
My trousers aren't the right size 
I go straight to pocket 
Take one step up and back to business 
My mind is closed so my body speaks 
My mind is clothed, my body squeaks 

And I'm rolling away, and I'm rolling away 
And I'm facing my only true smile 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
Somebody there is calling 
So I'm rolling away, I'm rolling away 
A sound of time is talking 
And I'm hauling away, and I'm hauling away 
This party here is too loud 

Nobody knows what clothes they're wearing 
Nobody knows which road is the white one 
So here we go holding up the motion 
You raise your hopes, you raise your chin 
You raise your glass with nothing in it 

It's a momentary lapse, a common habit 
Support your faith with this party face, and party pieces, 
And with their party faces, and party people 
With their powdered faces 

Just rolling away, just rolling away, just rolling away, 
Just rolling... 
Raintime, raintime, raintime..."
199,Winger,Madalaine,TRHDLHE128F4249236,1988,"Such tender eyes,
Such a sweet believer
The story never lies
When I found you girl
You were so far down
A black cat in disguise

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you've gone too far
Saving you soul for that one last kiss
Living you wish upon a star

Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain

Running scared
Through the dark of the day
The story never dies
But the names keep changin'
And the face fade
Take you dead or alive

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you've gone too far
Saving you soul for that one last kiss
Living you wish upon a star

Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain

All of your glory was left like an angry child
Waiting to take your luck away
But you can't see you're still running wild
Oh Madalaine!
Now don't run away from me

Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain"
200,Steve Earle,Back To The Wall,TRUILWV128E078A4D6,1988,"Well sometimes in the evenings I start to get that feeling 
Like I'm empty inside 
I know I'm doin' good now but tonight I'm headed downtown 
Down by the riverside 

I sit underneath the freeway with an old friend from the old days 
And a bottle of wine 
Well he used to call me ""Big Time"", and he knew someday that I'd shine 
Said he'd seen all the signs 
He said . . 

""Keep yourself to yourself 
Keep your bedroll dry 
And boy you never can tell 
What the shadows hide 
Keep one eye on the ground 
Pick up whatever you find 
'Cause you've got no place to fall 
When your back's to the wall"" 

He's gettin' old and it's showin' when I asked him how it's goin' 
He said ""I've seen better I guess 
I've been rained on, I've been frozen, but this here's the life I've chosen 
If it just wasn't for the loneliness"" 

Now this river suits me to a T. but if you're trying to raise a family 
It ain't no place to be 
There's a kid down by the dump there, ought to be in grade school somewhere 
Now he hangs out with me 
And I told him . . ."" 

Well we finished off the bottle and I told him,""Joe I think I ought to 
Be headed uptown"" 
Well it was late, and I'd been drinkin', drivin' home I got to thinkin' 
'Bout what's been going down 

Cause they're nervous down on Wall Street, but they're trying to keep it upbeat 
Or maybe they just don't care 
But down at the river eyes are burnin' cause they feel the tables turnin' 
So if you wind up down there . . ."
201,Rata Blanca,La Misma Mujer,TRPHNRA128F427E2C0,1988,"Todo su cuerpo besarás
Su ser entero tomarás
Pero tan solo si es también su desición
Principios puedes olvidar
Por atrapar su corazón

Entre sus brazos la pasión encontrarás
Ella conoce todo el poder de su piel
Entre sus piernas
Puedes sentirte más hombre que ayer

Su voz te puede susurrar
La más hermosa obsenidad
Hasta que puedas comprender
Con quién estás

Jamás permite que le den
Algo que ella no pidió
Es la primera en pisotear todo su amor

Puedes tomarla, puedes gozar hasta el fin
Más no pretendas que tenga
Un gesto de amor hacia ti

Ella no altera tu valor
Esa jamás fue su intención
Tan solo te quiere mostrar
Su gran passion

A veces puede confundir
Lo que es amar, lo que es sentir
Con ella puedes aprender una lección
Ella es eterna, ella es de hoy y de ayer
Tu la conoces, ella es la misma
La misma mujer"
202,Vern Gosdin,Chiseled In Stone,TRZOCMQ128F4266387,1988,"You ran cryin' to the bedroom 
I ran off to the bar,
Another piece of heaven gone to hell,
the words we spoke in anger
just tore my world apart,
And I sat there feeling sorry for myself.

Then that old man sat down beside me
and looked me in the eye,
and said ""Son, I know what you're going through,
You ought to get down on your knees 
and thank your lucky stars that you got someone to go home to.""

You don't know about lonely,
Or how long nights can be,
Till you lived through the story
That's still livin' in me,
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone,
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone.

So I brought these pretty flowers
hoping you would understand
sometimes a man is such a fool,
Those golden words of wisdom
from the heart of that old man,
showed me I ain't nothing without you.

You don't know about lonely,
Or how long nights can be,
Till you lived through the story
that old man just told me,
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone,
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone.
You don't know about lonely,
'til it's chiseled in stone."

It is one but not alone
There is beauty in the beast
It is endless; it is home

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory

Always moving, never leaving
It is words beyond meaning
You can feel it if you try
It has rhythm without seeming

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Listen to the promise inside me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory

Listen to the promise calling me
Can you hear the song of the factory
Listen to the promise inside me
Can you hear the song of the factory

Can you hear the song of the factory
Can you hear the song of the factory"
204,George Baker Selection,Morning Sky,TRSCEFJ128F146723F,1988,"Don't hide your heart behind the wall
Don't walk alone in gray and dark nights
Look to the sky and you'll be alright
There is a sun for you to shine

Look at yourself, what do you see?
A childhood feared to be alone
Maybe a heart without a home
But someone's waiting there for you

Morning sky
Let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night
Let me ride your silver cloud

Morning sky
Promise me you live tomorrow
Push away my pain and sorrow
In god's golden morning sky

Be like a river wide and strong
Don't be afraid to trust a friend
So let your life will be a song

Sing with a feeling in your heart

Morning sky
Let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night
Let me ride your silver cloud

Morning sky
Promise me you live tomorrow
Push away my pain and sorrow

13 men and Kennedy
Aboard the PT 109
To fight the Brazen enemy
On the isle of ol lusana
In the strait beyond nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night
Cut the '109 in two.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

On the coast, commanderos, lookin thru this periscope
Australian niven saw the battle
For the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fightin fire, fightin water, trying to save their lives somehow.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen Gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

Mac Me hun, the irishman, was burned so badly he couldn't swim
Leave me here, go on he said, cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT's skipper wouldn't leave him, a man to die alone at sea
With his strap, between his teeth, he towed the irishman to the sea.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
They thought they had the best of a mighty good man

He led his men thru water's Dark
Rocky reefs and hungry skarks
Braved the enemy's bayonets
A .38 around his neck
4 more days, 4 more nights,
A recue boat pulled into sight
The PT 109 was gone,
But Kennedy and his crew lived on

So who could Guess, and who could possibly know
That this same man named Kennedy, would,
Be the leader of a nation,
Be the one to take command,
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again,

Smokin fire upon the sea,
Everywhere they looked was the enemy,
But JFK and his crew lived on,
Which proves it's hard to get get the best of a man named John

Through his everyday hell, yeah

He loves his wine and his pretty women
He buys them everything just to stay around
He's got it made cause his daddy's got a bundle
He seldom reaches out but there's no one to be found
Except oh, he's still got them demons
And they stay right by his side
In his man-made hell

Oh, he's got his demons
And they by his side
Another dar in the life of the lonely
All alone in a sold out crowd

Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.
It is absurd to live in a cage,
You know there's got to be something better.

As they go by, don't look with eagle's eyes
Smile on your jailers until they grow weak.
Nothing can compare to something that's almost there
To tear up the madness that all of us seek.

Why'd you lie ?

While you were out there loving him

And now you're acting real nice
You're all sugar and spice
You've already thrown the dice
Your chances are real slim

Why'd you lie ?
Why'd you lie ?

You'd better make a correction
To all this deception
And start treating me right
'Cuz we had discussed it
'Til I was disgusted

All about sleeping in another man's bed

La manière de sourire
La façon d'arriver

Il commence sa chanson
Et je r'connais l'intro
C'est ma première leçon
D'la rigueur mais pas trop
Pour sa première rengaine
Il parle avec les mots
D'une jungle africaine
De l'adieu d'un bateau

Et il est jeune il est bon il est beau
Quel talent quelle leçon quel salaud

Quand il parle d'une femme
Elle ressemble à la mienne
Dans le bleu de ses larmes
Je me fais de la peine
Il joue avec mesure
De la mélancolie
Des passions des blessures
Sur le fil de ma vie

Et il est jeune il est bon il est beau
Quel talent quelle leçon quel salaud

Il s'arrête un silence
Et le public délire
Sur une histoire d'amour
Il enchaîne à plaisir
Il connaît mes images
Il sait les colorier
Il accroche un nuage
Que je lui ai soufflé

Il finit dans sa loge
Sonné comme un boxeur
Quand quelqu'un l'interroge
Il répond tout à l'heure
Et puis il m'aperçoit
Il m'embrasse il m'attire
Est-ce que c'est bien ma voix

Dying stars of the silver screen
Oh she danced that famous gypsy dance
With a hole in her tambourine

I swallowed down my Mickey Finn
She'd hijacked a few hearts, all right
I went into a tail spin

Oh, don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

I put my arm around her waist
Says she ""Young man, you're getting warm""
The room was going somewhere without me
And she laughed as she read my palm

Oh, don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't sing me, don't sing me 
Don't sing me no more gypsy love songs
Don't stir it up again

Oh stillborn love, passionate dreams, pitiful greed
And the silver tongues of the tinker girls
Who throw the book of life at you
But they don't know how to read

She was a third generation Transylvanian
I was the seventh son of a seventh son
I begged the band ""Don't play that tune.
Please don't beguine the begun""

When I awoke, she'd cut and run
She stole my blueprints and my change
Just a horseshoe and a note on the bed
And all it read was ""Strange""

There's another existence in parallel lines

We've got a bond so sweet so strong
For the sake of the good times we're still hanging on

In this man's world I'm always screaming to be heard
In this latest vessel a changing restless soul

And this is my heart talking
Only my heart talking
And I, and I still love you

Behind closed doors"

Puedo no ser inteligente

pero yo voy siempre de frente.

Voy a perecer

en misión suicida

Te voy a atrapar sin remedio

tiro por la calle de en medio

no tengo por norma asustarme

de Satán de Dios ni de nadie.

te va a costar seguir a flote

conseguirás que te destroce.

Voy a perecer

en misión suicida

tu me has hecho ser... kamikace

Yo te llevaré al huerto

vamos a facer un entuerto

pitos, flautas y prelavados

no merecen ser comentados

No hay callejón sin salida

nadie me va a dar por el sida

no le tengo miedo al misterio

voy a dar en el cementerio

Estoy muy bien

siendo yo mismo

aunque el final voy a hacerme cisco.

Voy a perecer

Wonder why I'm drinking

I'm not the man I used to be

If life were easy and didn't ask,
didn't tease me or take things back
I could start to understand,
what makes me the man I am

Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking
But it's plain to see,
I'm not the man I used to be

Oh, it's plain and it's a shame
I'm not the man I used to be

memories fading fast
I should save the ones I have
What's the use?
Most of them are bad

I said oh no, it really couldn't be
It was a man, it was a woman, too

He's a woman, she's a man

I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay

Just a pair of fallen angels tryin' to get through the night

Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, one by one, climbing Jacob's ladder

Comin' over the airwaves the man says I'm overdue
Sing a song, send money, join the chosen few
But mister I'm not in a hurry, and I don't want to be like you

Threads worms on a string 
Keeps spiders in her pocket 
Collects fly wings in a jar 
Scrubs horse flies 
And pinches them on a line 
Ohhh... 

She has one friend, he lives next door 
They're listening to the weather 
He knows how many freckles she's got 
She scratches his beard 

She's painting huge books 
And glues them together 
They saw a big raven 
It glided down the sky 
She touched it

Today is a birthday 
They're smoking cigars 
He's got a chain of flowers 
And sews a bird in her knickers

Cause he's a part of me just like I'm a part of you

How much longer must we stand alone together
Cause to live this way's a crime
And we're running out of time

If I had one wish we'd live as one together
All over the world
If I had one wish there would be peace forever
All over the world
Just one wish

There's a special place deep inside our hearts
There's an ancient flame burning brightly in the dark
And if we listen to the higher love inside
And heed the higher voice inside and not the voice of crime
No more will we fight with one another
There'll be rejoicing in the streets and the winds of old will seize

If I had one wish we'd live as one together
All over the world
If I had one wish there would be peace forever
All over the world
Just one wish

People, I know there's a better day coming
And wishes can come true
But it's up to me and you

One wish, we join hands together
All over the world
If I had one wish there would be peace forever
All over the world
I'm talking bout the children
We've got to come together

One wish, we live as one together
All over the world
If I had one wish there would be peace forever

A u pismu jedina tuga sto me razara

Tuga mi je velika

Unforgettable smile, unforgettable lies
In the name of the cross or a banner of love
With a hand of a friend or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

We're going to set fire to the house in my heart
We're going to set fire to the whole damn world
I don't understand the wicked things we do
In the name of the good, in the name of the few

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes
The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

Don't look up at me with your innocent smile
When the bed is burning around my head
When a war breaks out it'll be no surprise
Your unforgettable smile, your unforgettable lies

And I've got to start running to make my start
We've got to get together before we fall apart

They're pulling down the old slums to build the new
They're bringing back the old rules to please the few
In the name of the cross or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed, a little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

They're pulling down the old slums to build the new
Pull down the love I built wih you
Promise of tomorrow you never kept
And you tried to burn the house down
WhileI slept
The nation's in disorder
There's chaos in my heart

Before we fall apart
Before we fall apart"

Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid"

Eighteen wheels start to scream and whine
Dreamed you was out on that one way line
Come back baby it's cool inside

Someone's talking is it someone else or is it me?
You swim or sink to the bottom of the sea
Jump to the top and baby it's too high
Come back baby it's cool inside

Your eyes burn red, you don't dare blink
Your throat's parched but you don't dare drink
Your mind gets hazy, can't even think
You just stare straight ahead, try not to sink

Well, I'll be your mirror but that won't do no good
You see a house is a home but it's just made of wood
Take it from me baby, you'll see it all by and by
Come back baby, it's cool inside

Green meaning go, stop shining red
Little girl, you'd better not fuck with my head
Don't pull my trigger baby, that's suicide
Come back baby, it's cool inside

Your eyes burn red, you don't dare blink
Your throat's parched but you don't dare drink
Your mind gets hazy, can't even think
You just stare straight ahead, try not to sink

Time don't stop and it just goes by
And it don't matter if you like it and it don't matter if you cry
Your heart burns when it steps on your pride
Come back baby, it's cool inside."

Whistle while you work
Our backs are breaking
Up from hollow earth
From end to end
The noise begins
In the human battle stations
And the big one's coming in

Work, work, work, work
Work till holes are filled
Work, work, work, work
Bags of bone and skin
Lovers hold hands
Tossing their heads
Tangled in hair
Tied to earth
With skin and glue

But their skin is the same as yours
Coming in for the world to see
They can sit at the table, too
The same blood as you and me

Speak very softly
Hold my hand
Someone is sleeping
In my bed
Priests pass by
Worms crawl in
One dreams to be
One dream for all

His skin is the same as yours
Is he not made the same as you?
And some have fallen down
And blood spilled on the ground
Work, work, work
Till his life is done

The old man
Is at our door
And he's knocking
Knocking
As his neighbors weep
Each day repeats
Are we nothing in your eyes?
Someone answer, someone answer
This rusted garden gate
Can barely even stand
Their work is over now
And rest will be at hand

Is their skin not the same as yours?
Can they sit at the table to drink
Cool water
Cool water
And his lungs are filled with rain
And the water's rushing in"

It's not much of a career
And it won't make my fortune I fear
But it stays alight and won't be buried
It's brighter year-by-year
And someday it will surely disappear

When it does I'll know I've laid to rest
The ghost of your unhappiness
That flits around from room to room
A widow on a honeymoon
A shadow on a harvest moon

So put away this torch you carry
For it's doing you no good
And surely you know by now that you should
And come the day you die or marry
Will you be understood
When you say that you wanted but never could

Turn your back and lay to rest
The ghost of your unhappiness
That flits around from room to room
A widow on a honey moon
A shadow on a harvest moon

When she puts her eyes on me
Rocket ships far as I can see
Gotta watch my velocity
I'm falling too fast she's a hazard to me
Heavenly she looks divine
Moving past the speed of time
My head's in orbit
My mouth is wet
Look out now 
'Cause here she comes again

Whatever she's done 
There's no protection for me
Stranger than no fiction
Like a stranger she seems
The secrets she keeps
Her mystery fuelled
By the secrets she keeps

Candy love satellite

Von Kopf bis Fuß total auf Liebe eingestellt
Tanzte sie mit mir direkt in den Himmel hinein

Didn't you expect it when you opened your door
To the man with the long coat and the long list of victims
Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score

From where she sits, everyone stands in judgement
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade...

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn
Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn
I've been here all along standing here all this time
But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burn

From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Time is passing, slowly passing you by
You better try to find it before it passes you by
As I watch you walking to another cold dawn
And you keep on walking
And they keep on talking
Talking all along

From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment
Everybody watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone

And not only that, you'd be under my wing
And me and you'd be doin' the nasty thing
Whenever you're ready, we can go steady
You can be my baby and I can be your teddy
It's cold out there, but it's warm in here
I know you have another lover, but I do not care

Verse 2: Mike G

Now, behind my bush, there's only room for two
Jimmy and Jane, that's me and you
Doin' it right 'til the morning light
A ittle moan and groan after some fuss and fight
Jungle love is all that I'm givin
Jungle life is all that I'm livin
Girl, I'm-a do ya the best I can
Lettin' you know I'm your jungle man
You can't front it off, you know it's gonna get ya
I'm doin' this (where?) live from Africa

Verse 3: Afrika

I want to be your hero
I want to be your man
I want to love you every moment I can
I want to take you back to the motherland
And listen to the sounds of a steel-drum band
Climb up a tree, just you and me
'Cause that's the way that I want it to be
Feel the breeze, put your mind at ease
See the pretty birds and the chimpanzees
After that, we'd step down to my hut
And together, we'd split up a coconut
Watch the sun set, watch the moon rise
And then I'd proceed to make your nature rise

Verse 4: Mike G

I'll be your caveman, I'll be a brave man
But most of all, I'll be a gentle man
Your magic man, alakazam
I put a spell on you that you can not stand
Sweat and want you, it will surely taunt you
To do what you want to do
And that shall take me behind the bush and do me, baby"

He had help, sucker duck, now that's clue number three

They're only one of many that think a jealous fellow
Say ""yep"" then step cause I'm cool and mellow

Pushing rap for some info in exchange for a jumbo
And when I find a sucker it's time to play Rambo
Or play Commando, you know?
I knew it was the sucker with the Jackson 5 afro
We rock rhymes then we we run em a while
Sucker MC's catch on, then they bite our style
They get confused, dazed and amazed
Sweating and thing because our rhymes they used
Seen us in the crowd now they own their cost
They run around like a chicken with their heads cut off

They're on the bandwagon

Get off the bandwagon

""Who was that brother?"" while the record was playing
I felt kinda happy like an ego trip
I had to lounge cause my image is hip

And right about now I'm in perfect condition
So don't get mad, and don't stop hissing
Don't say nuttin homeboy just listen

(PMD)
No time for playing, sucker MC's I be slaying
Get off the bandwagon, you know what I'm saying?
I devastate the hip-hop scene
Keep the feet moving like a dancing machine

You wild on the groove with the beat on wax
I'm in my own world, no room for distraction
Controlling MC's while La Boss keeps scratching

A time where nothing grows old, nothing dies
It's a place where you can fly all around, heaven is found
Can't you see the bright lightning in sound

Close to the edge - I was running out of time
Close to the edge - but now there's peace of mind

And now I look to the north and I see in front of me
A shining blue light in the distance, oh I see
A castle of ivory gold, look out, behold
It almost never became my home

Close to the edge - I was running out of time
Close to the edge - walking on a thin, thin line

Close to the edge - the spotlight shines on you now
Close to the edge - you better make your choice soon now
Close to the edge - your heart's the key that makes you free
Close to the edge - as the world blinds your eyes, god can make you see
You're close to the edge

Don't burn out the light, it ain't burning bright,
Son, can't you see where you're going, you're close to the edge

I know you cry, you don't wanna die,
So take what I’ve found, and you'll be miles and miles from the edge
You're close to the edge

On the edge of the world there's only one rhyme
But you ain't got the time to know what it means,
You're dead, you're dead
Don't figure it out 'cause you're dead, you're dead.

On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world
No one else can save you only Jesus

I'll share with you some of mine

So put your arms around me, I'll put my arms 'round you
Greet me with a holy kiss, I'll greet you with one too
Oh, don't let go and keep me in your sight
For there is no place closer to Heaven than here with you tonight

God is not hiding someplace far away from you and me
Watching from a distance, as some would say
God, in his mercy, is here
Love in conquering sorrow, bringing hope to my tomorrow
He's the love within this place, he's the smile upon my face

So put your arms around me and I'll put my arms round you
Greet me with a holy kiss, I'll greet you with one too

Dangerous in my silence
Deadly to my cause

To leave what's now behind

The rich control the government, the media, the law
To make some kind of difference then everyone must know
Eradicate the fascists, revolution will grow

The system we learn says we're equal under law
But the streets are reality, the weak and poor will fall
Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown
Educate the masses, we'll burn the White House down

Guide my eyes and steps

The little lamb was sure to go, yeah.

He followed her to school one day,

That day at school.

Sent a letter to my baby,
On my way I passed it."

Trembling in mother's shit
Caged eyes tearless, filled with contempt

Smell lingering noxious mixed scent anxiety
Omnipotent doctor grinds the cage door
Revealing love's primal instinct taken away
Tiny face, terrified
Rant and rave, smash your head against the cage
Vacuum clicks on high

Conscious through the pain, pass off as humane
White coat seems so clean
Most dirt bleached out
Out of greed
Force the point of habit eyes burn in a rabbit 
Push the pain test button
Spine's cut

Trip mucous inflection more die
Pills each day 
What goes around comes back stronger
Tap into the brain, break the skull again

Smash price research rat lab rent paid in flesh
More ill drug store sales sharpen the knife
Emphasis on money
New disease everyday
End is seen and coming, research turns its back to gain

Crush the spine, genocide

Continuing all suffering

Burns out the will to live

Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand.

Are you going away with no word of farewell,
Will there be not a trace left behind ?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind.

You've got reasons a-plenty for going,
This I know, this I know.
For the weeds have been steadily growing,
Please don't go, please don't go.

Are you going away with no word of farewell,
Will there be not a trace left behind ?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind,
You know that was the last thing on my mind.

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you.
Every song in my breast dies a born-in
Without you, without you.

Are you going away with no word of farewell,
Will there be not a trace left behind ?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind."
263,Patti Smith,Up There Down There,TRNJKHY128F92C494F,1988,"Up there 
There's a ball of fire 
Some call it the spirit 
Some call it the sun 
Its energies are not for hire 
It serves man / It serves everyone 
Down there where Jonah wails 
in the healing water 
in the ready depths 
Twisting like silver swans 
No line of death no boundaries 

Up there 
The eye is hollow / The eye is winking 
The winds ablaze / Angels howling 
The sphinx awakens / But what can she say 
You'd be amazed 

Down there 
Your days are numbers 
Nothing to fear 
There will be trumpets 
There will be silence 
In the end the end 
Will be here just here 

Ahh the borders of heaven 
Are zipped up tight tonight 
The abstract streets 
The lights like some switched on Mondrian 
Cats like us are obsolete 
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet 
Thieves, poets we're inside out 
And everybody's a soldier 
Angels howl at those abstract lights 
And the borders of heaven 
Are zipped up tight tonight 

Up there 
There's a ball of fire 
Some call it the spirit 
Some call it the sun 
Its energies are not for hire 
It serves man / It serves everyone 
The air we breathe 
The flame of wisdom 
The earth we grind 
The beckoning sea 
It's no mystery / Not sentimental 
Ahh the equation / It's all elemental 

The world is restless 
Heaven in flux / Angels appear 
From the bright storm 
Out of the shadows 
Up there, down there 
But what can we say 
Man's been forewarned 

All communion is not holy 
Even those that fall 
They can prophet understanding 
It's all for man / It's for everyone 
It's up there, down there 
Everywhere / Everywhere 
Time for communion / Time for communion 
Talking communion ..."

The world thought the heights were too high to climb.
But people from Missouri never incensed me.
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from history I had learned
How many, many times the world had turned. 

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus 
When he said the world was round.
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound.

They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly.
They told Marconi wireless was a phoney.
It's the same old try.

They laughed at me, wanting you.
Said I was reaching for the moon.

The fear I've had so long is now reality
The only chance I have is when he throws you down
My chance is gone somebody's back in town

I know I can't change your ways we've been through that before
His trap is set and you will walk right in
He only wants a fly by night affair and nothing more
And you're just fool enough to fall again

Somebody's back in town why can't he stay away

There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
And the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around it
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

I'll see you all this coming fall
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains"

de una casa vecinal

hay un chico que

finaliza un ritual.

Sus gestos tienen precisión

haciendo honor a la ocasión

porque son las tres

de un domingo y él

va a una mística reunión

Cuando sale del portal

marcha con seguridad

al encuentro de sus amigos cómplices

Agrupado en formación

y con nueva identidad

toma posesión del estadio mágico

Ahora se siente bien

ahora podrá gritar

oh rey fútbol mi señor

que se haga tu voluntad

Embriagado de poder

que la masa le otorgó

su agresividad se desborda sin sentir

no se para a meditar que se puede provocar

la avalancha que hoy sería trágica.

El grado de su pasión

depende del marcador,

oh rey fútbol mi señor

concede el ansiado gol

Es tan feliz 

al compartir ese momento

Por fin la ofrenda se consumó

el mundo es un gran balón

entrando hasta la res

Por fin llegó la tranquilidad

los héroes saludan ya

a un campo puesto en pie.

Piensa que es un gladiador

que en combate intemporal

puede ser capaz de morir o de matar

No termina su misión

cuando pitan el final

porque siempre habrá un torneo más

Vuelve a casa el gladiador

y se acuesta sin cenar,

a una nueva lid.

into the glare of all out little wars 
Who pray to return to salute 
the coming and dying of the moon 
Oh sleeping sun 

Assassin in prayer 
laid a compass deep 
Exploding dawn 
and himself as well 
Their eyes for his eyes 
Their breath for his breath 
All to his end 

And a room in Lebanon 
Dust of scenes 
Erase and blend 
May the blanket of Kings 
Cover them and him 

Forgive them Father 
They know not what they do 
From the vast portals 
of their consciousness 
they're calling to you"
