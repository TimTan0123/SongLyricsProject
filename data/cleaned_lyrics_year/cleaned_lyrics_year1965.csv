0,Shangri Las,Give Us Your Blessings,TRJBICQ128F932EABD,1965,"Run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run
Jimmy, run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run

Mary and Jimmy were both very young
But as much in love
As two people could be
And all they wanted
Was to share that love eternally

They went to their folks they told them
That someday soon they'd be wed
Their folks just laughed
And called them kids
So Mary said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

They wouldn't have laughed at Mary
If they could have seen through the door
But Jimmy was waiting in the car
While Mary begged once more

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

Well as they drove off they were crying
And nobody knows for sure
That, that's why they didn't see the sign
That road detour

The next day they found them
Mary and Jimmy were dead
And as their folks
Knelt beside them in the rain
They couldn't help but hear
The last words that Mary and Jimmy had said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

Run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run
Jimmy, run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run"

All about you
That men are evil
The things you do
And I keep on (I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound)

And then I'm packin' (yes, I'm packin' up)

I gotta diamond ring
I gotta brand new man
He give me everything
So keep on (I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound)

You never seen a girl so sad and sorry as I was 
The boys in town are all my kin and my father is the pa 
If this continue I shall die a single miss 
So I'll go to mother and complain to her of this 

Oh daughter, haven't I taught you to forgive and to forget 
Even if this all is true, still you needn't fret 
Your father may be father to all the boys in town, still 
He's not the one who sired you, so marry who you will"

5,Otis Redding,For Your Precious Love,TRVVBQD12903CAF5ED,1965,"For your precious love means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do

Darling, I'm so surprised,
Oh, when I first realized
That you were fooling me
Darling, they say that our love won't grow
I just want to tell them that they don't know
For as long as you, long as you are loving me
Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea
And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world
Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl

(Wanting you) Wanting you,
(I'm lonely and blue) Whoa, lonely
That's what love will do

For your precious love means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I, I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue
That's what love will do"
6,Phil Ochs,I Ain't Marching Anymore (Alternate Version),TRYOFPH128F1473B1E,1965,"Oh, I marched to the battle of New Orleans,
At the end of the early British wars.
The young land started growing,
The young blood started flowing.
But I ain't a-marching anymore!

Oh I killed my share of Injuns in a thousand different fights,
I was there at the Little Big Horn.
I heard many men a-lying,
I saw many more a-dying.
But I ain't a-marching anymore!

It's always the old to lead us to the wars,
Always the young to fall.
Now look at what we've won with a saber and a gun.
Tell me is it worth it all?

For I stole California from the Mexican land,
Fought in the bloody Civil War.
Yes, I even killed my brothers,
And so many others.
But I ain't a-marching anymore!

For I marched to the battle of the German trench,
In a war that was bound to end all wars.
Oh I must have killed a million men,
And now they want me back again.
But I ain't a-marching anymore!

It's always the old to lead us to the wars,
Always the young to fall.
Now look at what we've won with a saber and a gun.
Tell me is it worth it all?

For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky,
Set off the mighty mushroom roar.
But I saw the cities burnin',
And I knew that I was learnin',
That I ain't a-marching anymore!

Now the labor leader's screamin' when they closed the missile plant,
United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore.
Call it peace or call it treason,
Call it love or call it reason.
But I ain't a-marching anymore!
I ain't a-marching anymore!"
7,Smokey Robinson & The Miracles,My Girl Has Gone,TRKPZAC128E079429B,1965,"When you were mine I loved you so much
A got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself

Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
Don't give up, give love one more try
'Cause there's a right girl for every guy

Baby, all your love wasn't right for me
Good for another it well may be
Some girls just weren't made for some guys
Now I've got to make myself realize

That my girl has gone (yes she has)
And said goodbye (I tell myself that)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah

I've got the feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby

Now happiness and all the best
That's all that I wish for you, oh yeah
Don't be like me in misery
I'm feelin' so sad and blue
I said I'm sad and I'm blue, oh yeah
Sad and I'm blue, I said I'm sad and I'm blue

Because my girl has gone
And said goodbye (and I tell myself)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah

(And I can't go on if I hear you say)
Girl has gone (yes you can) and said goodbye
(And I start to cry, I say)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high

8,Otis Redding,It's Too Late,TRQXTXV128F4276278,1965,"Wished i had told her
Ooh she was my only one
But it's too late, it's too late
She's gone

It's too late, she's gone now
I know she's gone now
It's too late, my baby's gone now
I need her loving
Oh more than anyone ooh
But it's too late, i know it's too late
She's gone

It's a weak man that cry now
So I guess I better
Guess I better dry my weeping eyes now
I need her loving
More than anyone oh
But it's too late
It seems like it's too late
She's gone

She's gone, my baby's gone,
She's gone, oh my baby, she's gone
She's gone, my baby's she's gone
But where can, where can my my baby be

Lord, I wonder sometimes
Does she really know
Does she really know
Does she really know when she left me
Oh it hurt little heart so now
I need your loving
Please don't make me wait
Lord, but it's too late, it's too late
She's gone
I need your loving
Oh more than anyone
Don't let it be too late
No, don't let it be too late
But she's gone

Wished I had told her
Ooh she was my only one
Ooh but it's too late
I know it's to late
She's gone
Wished I had told her
Oh she was the only one..."
9,Bert Jansch,Strolling Down The Highway,TRHMQAO128F9328C24,1965,"Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna to get there my way
Dusk 'till dawn I'm walking
Can you hear my guitar rockin'?
While I stroll on down, on down the highway

People think I'm a crazy
But lord above ain't lazy
The sun shines all day long
The garlic's far too strong
While I stroll on down, on down the highway

While I stroll on down, on down the highway

The cars won't stop for no one
They'd all think your just a rollin' bum
They think you are a spy
Gonna shoot them as a they go by
No, the cars they won't stop, won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna to get there my way
Dusk 'till dawn I'm walking
Can you hear my guitar rockin'?
While I stroll on down, on down the highway"
10,Phil Ochs,Links On The Chain (LP Version),TRIURPE128F1473B17,1965,"Come you ranks of labor, come you union core
And see if you remember the struggles of before
When you were standing helpless on the outside of the door
And you started building links on the Chain
On the Chain, you started building links on the Chain

When the police on the horses were waitin' on demand
Ridin' through the strike with the pistols in their hands
Swingin' at the skulls of many a union man
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain
As you built one more link on the chain

Then the army of the fascists tried to put you on the run
But the army of the union, they did what could be done
Oh, the power of the factory was greater than the gun
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain
As you built one more link on the chain

And then in 1954, decisions finally made
The black man was a-risin' fast and racin' from the shade
And your union took no stand and your union was betrayed
As you lost yourself a link on the chain, on the chain
As you lost yourslef a link on the chain

And then there came the boycotts and then the freedom rides
And forgetting what you stood for, you tried to block the tide
Oh, the automation bosses werre laughin' on the side
As they watched you lose your link on the chain, on the chain
As they watched you lose your link on the chain

You know when they block your trucks boys, by layin' on the road
All that they are doin' is all that you have showed
That you gotta strike, you gotta fight to get what you are owed
When you're building all your links on the chain, on the chain
When you're building all your links on the chain

Amd the man who tries to tell you that they'll take your job away
He's the same man who was scabbin' hard just the other day
And your union's not a union till he's thrown out of the way
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain, of the chain
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain

For now the times are tellin' you the times are rollin' on
And you're fighting for the same thing, the jobs that will be gone
Now it's only fair to ask you boys, which side are you on?
As you're buildin' all your links on the chain, on the chain
As you're buildin' all your links on the chain"
11,The Rolling Stones,I Can't Be Satisfied,TRQWNSC128F9310F15,1965,"Well I'm going away to live
Won't be back no more
Going back down south, child
Lord now don't you worry ma 

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Well I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying 

Well I feel like snapping
Pistol in your face
Going to let some graveyard
Lord be your resting place 

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying
Yeah 

Yeah I'm all in my sleep
Hear my doorbell ring
Looking for my baby
Lord seen a doggone thing 

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying 

Yeah I know my little old babe
She gonna jump and shout
That old train be late man
Lord I come walkin out 

Woman I'm trouble
Trouble and all worried mind
Yeah I just can't be satisfied
Just can't keep on crying
Well"

Sleep little boy
Sleep and be warm as May
Take a voyage to dreamland far away
Ride on a cloud
Run down the milky way
Fill your pockets with moonbeams
Far, far away

Sleep, sleep
Rest your head and be happy
Softly, softly
Sing this song with me

Sleep little boy
Soon you will be a man
There is nothing to harm you
I'll hold your hand"
13,Peter_ Paul and Mary,The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face (LP Version),TRYRCVP12903CBFADD,1965,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies my love
To the dark and the empty skies. 

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command. 

The first time ever I held you near
And felt your heartbeat close to mine
I thought our joy would fill the world
And would last till the end of time my love
And would last till the end of time."

Right now and not later, baby.
Right now and not later.
'Cause later may be too late,
And I gotta know right now.

#16 Jun '65 Hot 100

(CHORUS)
Take me back, I'm begging please
Take me back, I'm on my knees
For you to scold me
Hurt me, hold me
Darling, take me back

When you belonged to me
I had a jealous mind
Too late I learned that you
Were not the cheating kind

(CHORUS)

My jealous eyes have learned
To take a look or two
They were too blind to see
That I was losing you

(CHORUS)

They say you live and learn
And though I've tried before
I promise never to
Be jealous any more

violence flarin', bullets loadin',

and even the Jordan river has bodies floatin',
but you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?
Can't you see the fear that I'm feeling today?
If the button is pushed, there's no running away,
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave,
take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy,
but you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin',
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin',
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation,
handful of Senators don't pass legislation,
and marches alone can't bring integration,
when human respect is disintegratin',
this whole crazy world is just too frustratin',
and you tell me over and over and over again my friend,
ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Think of all the hate there is in Red China!
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama!
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space,
but when your return, it's the same old place,
the poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace,
you can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace,
hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace,

Queen of the house

No time to fix my hair
Need a new dress to wear
Old clothes will have to do
'Cause the kids all need new shoes

I got bridge club each Tuesday night
He goes out with the boys and gets tight
But when the evenin's through, he comes a-home to
Queen of the house

I know the milkman, the iceman, they come every day
They give me tips on the horses to play
And when I got the time to spare 
I sit and wish that I'd picked a rich millionare

I sing up every day at six
Bacon and eggs to fix
Four kids from one to four
Pretty soon there'll be one more

Oh by Sundays I'm mighty glad
We send the kids to his Mom and Dad
It's the day that makes me glad I'm

Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found
As the ranger's badge shoot brightly el bandito laid on the ground

Du ligger utan blus och kjol
Med läpparna mot mitt öra
Tala nu allvar ber du bestämt
Du skrattar visor, du sjunger skämt
Du kan men vill inte göra
En sång om lyckan den sköra

Nu stiger sol och nu faller dagg
För fattigt folk och för rika
Men lyckan har en förgiftad tagg
Som man bör noga undvika
Hon stannar gärna i några dar
Men när du vill hålla henne kvar
Blir hennes ögon iskalla
Och du blir bitter som galla

Nu faller daggen för utan ljud
Och gräs och blader blir våta
Och varje morgon står solen brud
Fast inga brudpsalmer låta
Ann-Katarin du ska veta att
Det finns en lycka som dör av skratt
Men den vill smekas om natten
Och den är stilla som vatten

Stig upp ur sängen Ann-Katarin
Och lyssna på något viktigt
Det finns ett särskillt slags ädelt vin
Som man bör njuta försiktigt
För om man dricker det utan sans
Förlorar det sin forna glans
Och du får kvar en tom flaska
Och bittra tårar och aska"

46,The Seekers,The Carnival Is Over,TRPROCD128F932A528,1965,"Say goodbye my own true lover
As we sing a lovers song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

High above the dawn is waiting
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over
We may never meet again

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you till I die

Like a drum, my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping

My weariness amazes me
I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughing spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And, but for the sky, there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you"

I had to make you mine

Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true and I'd spend my life with you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from a window

Say that you'll be mine tonight"

Dos pupilas encendidas
Sobre el tronco de la vida

And you found a new love it seems

Once I had you and the wild wood
Now, it's just dusty roads
And I can't help from blamin' your going
On the coming, the coming of the roads

Look how they've cut all to pieces
Our ancient poplar and oak
And the hillsides are stained with the greases
That burned up the heavens with smoke

You used to curse the bold crewmen
Who stripped our earth of its ore
Now, you've changed and you've gone over to them
And you've learned to love what you hated before

In your arms, and squeeze her tight

Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to hurtin' once a day

Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long

I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day

Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day every day all day long
Once a day every day all day long"

Little church bells keep ringing

Little church bells ringing out at Christmas time
Reminding us that the star of love still shines
Not just at Christmas but every day.

Little bright star, you're there to show us the way

Once in a while, it could be any time of the day

And if it's gonna be like this, why should I try anymore?

""Stand and deliver for I am your bold deceiver""

Mush-a-ring-um duram da
Whack fol the daddy o
Whack fol the daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar. 

He counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put in me pocket to take home to darlin' Jenny
She sighed and swore she loved me 
And never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they always lie so easy 

(Refrain) 

I went into me chamber all for to take a slumber
To dream of gold and girls and o'course it was no wonder
Me Jenny took me charges and she filled them up with water
Called on Colonel Farrell to get ready for the slaughter 

(Refrain) 

Next mornin' early before I rose to travel
A' came a band o' footmen and likewise Colonel Farrell
I goes to draw me pistol for she'd stole away me rapier
But a prisoner I was taken, I couldn't shoot the water 

(Refrain) 

They put me into jail with the judge all a-writin'
For robbin' Colonel Farrell on Gilgarra Mountain
But they didn't take me fists so I knocked the jailer down
And bid a farewell to this tight-fisted town 

(Refrain) 

I'd like to find me brother, the one that's in the army
I don't know where he's stationed, in Cork or in Killarney
Together we'd go roamin'o'er the mountains of Kilkenny
And I swear he'd treat me fairer than me darlin' sportin' Jenny 

(Refrain) 

There's some takes delight in the carriages and rollin'
And some takes delight in the hurley or the bollin'
But I takes delight in the juice of the barley
Courtin' pretty maids in the mornin' oh so early

81,Bert Jansch,Harvest Your Thoughts Of Love,TRGZNMO12903CA6001,1965,"Your love was like a child
upon a rockin' horse
The colour black who rides
Thro' a forest of dreams and laughs.
At the evils that cannot be seen.

Yet like the ageing of a child at play,
Your love is broken and fades away,
And borne in the wind are the seeds
that burn in the hearts
Of boys a-passing your way.

When the first day's light has dawned,
You wake to find your troubles gone,
Then love only life as it grows,
And trust every flower,
But not the red, red rose.

Spread your wings and fly my love,
Dance upon the clouds above,
Harvest your thoughts of love."

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Think I'll go down to Alberta
Where there's good times in the Fall
Got some friends that I can stay with, working for
But I wish you'd change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times before

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are looking good
I could meet you if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
There ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Windy Bill was a Texas man
Well, he could rope, you bet.
He swore the steer he couldn't tie-
Well, he hadn't found him yet.
But the boys they knew of an old black steer,
A sort of an old outlaw
That ran down in the malpais
At the foot of a rocky draw.

This old black steer had stood his ground
With punchers from everywhere ;
So they bet old Bill at two to one
That he couldn't quite get there.
Then Bill brought out his old gray hoss,
His withers and back were raw,
And prepared to tackle the big black brute
That ran down in the draw.

With his Brazos bit and his Sam Stack tree*,
His chaps and taps to boot,
And his old maguey** tied hard and fast,
Bill  swore he'd get the brute.
Now, first Bill sort of sauntered round.
Old Blackie began to paw
Then threw his tail straight in the air
And went driftin' down the draw.

The old gray plug flew after him,
For he'd been eatin' corn;
And Bill, he piled his old maguey
Right round old Blackie's horns.
The old gray hoss he stopped right still;
The cinches broke like straw,
And the old maguey and the Sam Stack tree
Went driftin' down the draw.

Bill, he lit in a flint rock pile,
His face and hands was scratched.
He said he thought he could rope a snake***,
But he guessed he'd met his match;
He paid his bets like a little man
Without a bit of jaw
And 'lowed old Blackie was the boss
Of anything in the draw.

There's a moral to my' story, boys,
And that you all must see.
Whenever you go to tie a snake
Don't tie it to your tree;
But take your dolly welters****
'Cordin' to California law,
And you'll never see your old rim-fire*****
     Go drifting down the draw."

Filled my heart when she came into view

That only those in love would understand

Why she left me I will never know

Southern trees
Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop

As sung by Billie Holiday

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter cry."

Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me

I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers 
Up come a flattop he was movin' up with me 
Then come sailin' goodbye 
In a little old suped up jitney 
I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll 
Moanin' sirens, was the state patrol 
So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn 
Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne

Cuddle up honey be my love 
Sweetest little thing that I ever seen 
I'm gonna name you Mabelline 
Flyin' with all the things set on flight control 
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll

To set before my eyes
Nothing to blame
When the blues start to rise
Just the memory of laughter
And the living out of lies
And if I could change my ways, babe
You'd never have said goodbye

If you ever get the time, baby
Please think on me
It's a lock that can't be broken
And there isn't any key
And I'm only in your mind
Only you can set me free
You can't hurt me anymore, babe

Someday, someone will leave you

With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame

Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh

And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascaraed eye and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame

And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says 'From Macy's Mezzanine'
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl

She's only fooling Tangerine"

And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer you my kind of man so big and so strong
Come a little bit closer I'm all alone and the night is so long

So we started to dance in my arms she felt so inviting
And I just couldn't resist the one a little kiss so exciting
Then I heard the guitar player say ""Vamos,  Jose's on his way""
And I knew yes I knew I should leave then I heard her say
Come a little bit closer...

Then the music stopped when I looked the cafe was empty
Then I heard Jose say man you know you're in trouble plenty
So I dropped my drink from my hand and through the window I ran
And as I rode away I could hear her say to Jose

Tá na hora de voltar pro Amazonas
Na cidade, na saudade choro tanto
Que meu pranto feito rio
Se fez mar...
Vou embora
Com a viola companheira do meu canto
Vou sozinho meu caminho caminhando
Vou cantando pra tristeza espantar
Vou armar a minha rede
Com a morena me embalar (sonhar)
Sonho livre
Como a garça voa livre pelo espaço
Vou descer meu rio abaixo de canoa
Vida boa de ter tempo pra sonhar
Vou fazer uma palhoça
Com a morena vou morar (e amar)
Vou ser livre
Como livre vai correndo o Amazonas
Na canoa deslizando em suas ondas
Vou seguir o seu caminho para o mar"
171,Georges Brassens,Je Suis Un Voyou,TRFFSTR12903CC3997,1965,"Ci-gît au fond de mon cœur
Une histoire ancienne,
Un fantôme, un souvenir
D'une que j'aimais
Le temps, à grands coups de faux,
Peut faire des siennes,
Mon bel amour dure encore,
Et c'est à jamais.

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En trouvant Margot,
Princesse vêtue de laine,
Déesse en sabots
Si les fleurs, le long des routes,
S'mettaient à marcher,
C'est à la Margot, sans doute,
Qu'elles feraient songer

J'lui ai dit: ""De la Madone,
Tu es le portrait!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne,
C'était un peu vrai
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine:
Je suis un voyou.

La mignonne allait aux vêpres
Se mettre à genoux,
Alors j'ai mordu ses lèvres
Pour savoir leur goût...
Ell' m'a dit, d'un ton sévère:
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire,
Les filles, c'est comme ça.

J'lui ai dit: ""Par la Madone,
Reste auprès de moi!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne,
Mais chacun pour soi
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine:
Je suis un voyou.

C'était une fille sage,
A bouche, que veux-tu?
J'ai croqué dans son corsage
Les fruits défendus
Elle m'a dit d'un ton sévère:
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire,
Les filles, c'est comme ça.

Puis, j'ai déchiré sa robe,
Sans l'avoir voulu
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne,
Je n'y tenais plus!
Qu'il me pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine:
Je suis un voyou.

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En perdant Margot,
Qui épousa, contre son âme,
Un triste bigot
Elle doit avoir à l'heure,
A l'heure qu'il est,
Deux ou trois marmots qui pleurent
Pour avoir leur lait

Et, moi, j'ai tété leur mère
Longtemps avant eux
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne,
J'étais amoureux!
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine:
Je suis un voyou."

Qu'c'est au hasard des rues
Sur un d'ces fameux bancs
Qu'ils ont vécu le meilleur
Morceau de leur amour

Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a goin' to school, 
and I'm working in a defense plant.

I've got a dislocated disc and a racked-up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.
I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy came close to me
I'd probably start to sneeze.

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies,
but one thing you gotta see
That someone's gotta go over there

To stake his claim on my baby.

My baby, has a kiss so sweet, she knocks me off my feet, 
She makes my life complete 

Who has my mind in a kind of haze,Who has me walkin' around in a daze. 
My baby, my baby, my baby, hey hey hey 
My baby, Baby, pretty Baby

She gives me a feelin I can't explain,She sets my soul on fire.

Woooo that's my baby, my baby, my baby"

194,Billy Walker,Matamoros,TRFDTAG12903CCCF07,1965,"In old Mexico I stand on the square in Matamoros
Round a Plazza the couples were walking to music so sweet
I've found my love not too long ago in Matamoros
But I'm feeling low as the beggar who sits in the street
All the promises that she made me with eyes black as midnight
How could I know how fickle her promise would be
Now I'm back to find for I feel is mine in Matamoros
And there'll be bad trouble if I catch her cheating on me

Streets're narrow and dark and tequilla runs free in Matamoros
I stopped for one moment outside at Maguel's swinging doors
My heart breaks to hear the same haunting sounds of Granada
She once called it our song and vowed should be mine evermore
Then across the square went this wild young bracero I see her
Laughing and dancing and tossing her raven black hair
They'd may take a hand when I face this man from Matamoros
For the love of my woman is one thing that I'll never share

Now I walk in the night far away from the lights of Matamoros
And recall the last moments when I knew she loved me more than life
I can still hear her cry I love you and I'll prove it Manana
Then seeing my danger she jumped in front of his knife
I know the stories they'll tell in dimly casinos
Of the raven haired beauty who for her love laid dead on the floor
They'll speak of the fight with the gringo that night in Matamoros
And wonder what happened for he never returned anymore oh oh hoo"
195,Phil Ochs,Days Of Decision (LP Version),TRJZQPT128F1473B1C,1965,"Oh, the shadows of doubt are in many a mind,
Lookin' for an answer they're never gonna find,
But they'd better decide 'cause they're runnin' out of time,
For these are the days of decision.

Oh, the games of stalling you cannot afford,
Dark is the danger that's knocking on the door,
And the far-reaching rockets say you can't wait anymore,
For these are the days of decision.

In the face of the people who know they're gonna win,
There's a strength that's greater than the power od the wind,
And you can't stand around when the ice is growing thin,
For these are the days of decision.

I've seen your heads hinding 'neath the blankets of fear,
When the paths they are plain and the choices are clear,
But with each passing day, boys, the cost is more dear
For these are the days of decision.

There's many a cross that burns in the night,
And the fingers of the fire are pointing as they bite,
Oh you can't let the smoke keep on blinding all your sight,
For these are the days of decision.

Now the mobs of anger are roamin' the street,
From the rooftops they are aimin' at the police on the beat,
And in city after city you know they will repeat,
For these are the days of decision.

There's been warnin's of fire, warnin's of flood,
Now there's the warnin' of the bullet and the blood,
From the three bodies buried in the Mississippi mud,
Sayin' these are the days of decision.

There's a change in the wind, and a split in the road,
You can do what's right or you can do what you are told,
And the prize of the victory will belong to the bold,
Yes, these are the days of decision."

desde el fondo del obraje maderero,
con el anhelo del agua que se va.

Padre río, tus escamas de oro vivo
son la fiebre que me lleva más allá.
Voy detrás de tu horizonte fugitivo
y la sangre con el agua se me va

Banda, banda; sol y luna; cielo y agua:
espejismo que no acaba de pasar.
Piel de barro, fabulosa lampalagua:
me devora la pasión de navegar.

La tierra del chaco quebrachera y montaraz
Prendera en mi sangre con un ronco sapucay
Y sera en el surco mi sombrero bajo el sol
Faro de luz

Algodon que se va ... Que se va ... Que se va ...
Plata blanda mojada de luna y de sol
Un ranchito borracho de sueños y amor
Quiero yo

De corrientes vengo yo

Y en la costa un acordeon
Gimiendo va su lento chamame

Rumbo a la cosecha cosechero yo me ire
Y entre copos blancos mi esperanza cantare
Con manos curtidas dejare en el algodon

Legs of steel, leather on her arms
Taking on a man to die
A life for a life, an eye for an eye
And death's the iron lady in the chair

Stop the murder, deter the crimes away
Only killing shows that killing doesn't pay
Yes that's the kind of law it takes
Even though we make mistakes
And sometimes send the wrong man to the chair

In the death row waiting for their turn
No time to change, not a chance to learn
Waiting for someone to call
Say it's over after all
They won't have to face the justice of the chair

Just before they serve him one last meal
Shave his head, they ask him how he feels
Then the warden comes to say goodbye
Reporters come to watch him die
Watch him as he's strapped into the chair

And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer
Be brave my son, the Lord is waiting there
Oh murder is so wrong you see
Both the Bible and the courts agree
That the state's allowed to murder in the chair

In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed
The finest lawyers fees are paid
And a rich man never died upon the chair

Have you seen the iron lady's charms
Legs of steel, leather on her arms
Taking on a man to die
A life for a life, an eye for an eye
That's the iron lady in the chair"

Whoa, the fat trees of the forest have hid a thousand crimes,
The calender is lyin' when it reads the present time.
Whoa, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of,
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of!

And here's to the people of Mississippi
Who say the folks up north, they just don't understand
And they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the Klan
The sweating of their souls can't wash the blood from off their hands
They smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the schools of Mississippi
Where they're teaching all the children that they don't have to care
All the rudiments of hatred are present everywhere
And every single classroom is a factory of despair
There's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

They're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door

No they don't like taking prisoners in their private little war
Behind their broken badges there are murderers and more

When the black man stands accused the trial is always short

And here's to the government of Mississippi
In the swamp of their bureaucracy they're always bogging down
And criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns
And they hope that no one sees the sights and no one hears the sounds
And the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the laws of Mississippi
Congressmen will gather in a circus of delay
While the Constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay
Unwed mothers should be sterilized, I've even heard them say
Yes, corruption can be classic in the Mississippi way
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the churches of Mississippi
Where the cross, once made of silver, now is caked with rust
And the Sunday morning sermons pander to their lust
The fallen face of Jesus is choking in the dust
Heaven only knows in which God they can trust

She's so fine, she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want Candy, I want Candy

Go to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

I want Candy, I want Candy
I want Candy, I want Candy, I want Candy
Hey, hey , hey , hey

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make her mine
Then I'll have Candy all the time

I want Candy, I want Candy
Woooo
Hey (repeat and fade)"

If I have you, if I love you just the same
If you're here, the night is rightly gone before
If you're gone, I'll see the daylight and that's all

If I stand on, understanding what is now
If I ever need someone to show me how
If the daylight can be hidden by the sun
If you're gone, then I know I will need someone

If I love you, if I know how much I care
If I find the things you are then anywhere
If I know you, I may never know your name
If you're gone, then there is nothing that remains"
217,Mercedes Sosa,Los Inundados,TRZNOQW128F427CF42,1965,"Bramando se viene el agua
Del Paraná
Creciendo noche y día
Sin parar.

Ranchada, barranca, tronco
Se llevará
Con viento y aguacero
El Paraná.

Mi rancho hasta la cumbrera
Ya se anegó
Ni el ceibo ni el aromo
Tienen flor.

Estaba triste la tarde
Cuando me fui;
Cantó su dulce queja
El yerutí.

Por el río navegando
La canoa va cargada
Redes, palos, aparejos
Los salvé de la ranchada.
Por el río volveré
A Santa Fe.

El agua vino bramando
Pobre quedé
Ni rancho ni cobija
He de tener.

No me han de sacar del pago
Donde nací
Peleando a la corriente
He de vivir.

El cielo ya está limpiando
Vuela el chajá
Calandrias y crestudos
Cantan ya.

Así ha de llegar día
En que volveré
A levantar mi rancho
En Santa Fe."

True love won't change, so I am told
But one day you're warm, the next day you're cold
I'm tired of you tearing me apart
I'd like to know if you've got a heart

I think that you're using me
Till you find someone new
But if you wait too long
You'll have to find me too

And the leaves dance and play after you
Take my hand and hold it as you would a flower
Take care with my heart, oh darling, she's made of glass

Your eyes feel like silence resting on me
And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted
Take care how you ride, my precious, you might fall down

In the pastel skies a sunset I have wandered
With my eyes and ears and heart stRained to the full
I know I tasted the essence in the few days
Take care who you love, my precious, he might not know"
224,Bob Dylan,Subterranean Homesick Blues,TRGTMWR128F92F76F4,1965,"Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government

The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off

Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again

You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen

Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but

The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A.

Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try No Doz

Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes

You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is gonna sell

Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail

Look out kid
You're gonna get hit

But losers
Cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters

Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success

Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift

Look out kid
They keep it all hid

Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals

Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles"
225,Jackson C. Frank,My Name Is Carnival,TRXEPLC128F92EC495,1965,"I've seen your face in every place that I'll be goin'
I read your words like black hungry birds read every sowin’
Rise and fall, spin and call, and my name is Carnival

Sad music in the night sings a scream of light out of chorus
And voices you might hear appear and disappear in the forest
Short and tall throw the ball, and my name is Carnival

Strings of yellow tears drip from black-wired fears in the meadow
And their white halos spin with an anger that is thin and turns to sorrow
King of all, hear me call, hear my name - Carnival

Here there is no law but the arcade's penny claw, hanging empty
The painted laughing smile and the turning of the style do not envy
And the small can steal the ball, to touch the face of Carnival

The fat woman frowns at screaming frightened clowns that move enchanted
And the shadow lie and waits outside your iron gates with one wish granted
Colors fall, throw the ball, play the game of Carnival

Without a thought of size, you come to hypnotize the danger
The world that comes apart has no single heart when life is stranger
Wheel and call, clawed dreams all, in the name of Carnival
Wheel and call, clawed dreams all, in my name of Carnival"
226,Marianne Faithfull,In My Time Of Sorrow,TRTUPNC128F42480BE,1965,"In my time of sorrow,
In my time of feeling bad
Oh what I'd give
Just to relive
All of the good times that I've had.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of feeling alone
There was a time
I could ease my mind
With thoughts of just being on my own.

Changes of life
I'm going through
Keep me from doing
What I know I should do.

In my time of sorrow
In my time where teardrops fall
I can't tell you why
I don't want to try,
But the time has come
For me to say fare well.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of sorrow
In my time of sorrow..."

Till the day I die

If I never get to love you
It won't be that I ran away
For as long as you will have me
Close to you, I'll stay

What I wouldn't give to hold you tight
Never, never let you out of sight
Be the one you give your first kiss every morning
The last one you kiss goodnight

If I never get to love you
It won't be that I didn't care
There is nothing that I want more
Or I need more
And my heart would surely break in two
