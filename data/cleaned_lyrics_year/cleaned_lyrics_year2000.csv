Y de ocho rios
Te escribo de ocho rios.
Y de ocho rios
Te escribo de ocho rios.Con un cigarro en la piel
Te escribo
Con un cigarro en la sien
Te digo
Que en ocho rios
Ya soy parte de ocho rios.
Se duerme el ángel
En mi corazón
Y este sueño no,
No tiene dolor.

Me quedo, me quedo
Me quedo, para no volver.
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo,
Me quedo, me quedo.
En ocho ríos

Y de ocho rios
Te escribo de ocho rios
Con esa marca en la piel
Con esa vieja mujer
Te digo
Ya soy parte de ocho ríos
Se duerme el angel
En mi corazon
Y este sueño no tiene
Nada de dolor.

Me quedo, me quedo para no volver
Me quedo, me quedo, me quedo
Me quedo, me quedo
En ocho rios

Pagué la cuota de mi libertad
Pagué la cuota de mi libertad
Pagué la cuota de mi libertad
Y en ocho rios..."

3,NOFX,Total Bummer,TRNYIFL128F426252C,2000,"Go away sunny day
All the horny people sitting in front of their TV and thinking
What is wrong with me I'm not a monster
Why won't anybody fuck me
I don't wanna live life lonely
Why does everyone have to be perfect

Go away sunny day
All the barflys sipping whiskey
Fighting ever present pity
Wondering what they are sucking back for
Is it the drink or trepidation,
Watching all trains leave the station
Left standing alone without a ticket

You light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And you light up my life

Go away sunny day
Stop searching cause there's no answer
Just a long line of disaster
There's no simple way to stop the sadness
Life's not fair I'm glad it's not
This isn't heaven just a lonely planet
On the verge of self destruction"
4,Patti Smith,Lo and Beholden,TRAMUYQ128F428CA58,2000,"I was alone and content in my world
Dancing on air
You sent to me a message that said
I like your style 
Will you come to the temple tonight 
And dance for me there 
I pledge to you all that you wish 
The moon and the stars 

Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you

In the palace there was wild reverie
And the look in your eyes
As I dropped veil after veil
Was drunken desire
The dove calls and God notes it all 
The naked truth
Here is my veil the seventh and last
It will cost you

Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you

The royal word has passed
The prophet's head is all I ask 
For beauty and the naked truth
It will cost you

Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden 
Oh I'm beholden to you"
5,Transatlantic,My new world,TRBIQNZ128F92E4D83,2000,"The place she called home was high on a hill,
way up in a big house under the trees
Day's in the sun she's seen by the river,
reading a book, feeding her dreams
Now she's a loner, now she's a stoner, no one can touch her ...

He was the boy, the pride of his mother,
stainless and shining, all heaven sent
But then the country calls for a soldier
and he went out to a foreign land
When he returned faces look different,
at the end of innocence nothing's the same

My new world was spinning me around
And that was all that could be
My new world was spinning me around
And nothing's lost on memory
My new world was spinning me around ...

Hiked up to Woodstock, she got high in Frisco,
summers of love, that child she was wild
She had the need for total expression,
painting and poetry filled up her mind
Boy, he took pride in serving his country,
went off to war no more than a child

My new world was spinning me around
And this is all that i've found
My new world was spinning me around
And time can be my enemy
My new world was spinning me ...

Now she's a loner, now she's a stoner, no one can touch her ...

Out in the fields we met in the summer
On a poetic island no past to recall
Breaking like waves we flooded the moment
Laughing at the perfectness of it all

My new world waits patiently
When living is lost in a memory
My new world is ahead of me
But sometimes I'm back where I used to be ...
Then the fall ran away with our time

Dissapointment struch so hard
When he found out there was no
""Lucky stars and stripes""
They set it all on fire !!!
While Jim and Janis got us higher
""She's so freaky, she's so fine""
Soldier, he can't get her off his mind
Down the desert to the sea
Leave the raving 60's all behind ...

Out of the blue still reaching for something
Feeling the window of time out of mind
Catching a glimpse each one to the other
Always not knowing the spark left behind
Going and going with fictional borders
Passing two feet from the door

My new world keeps spinning me around
And this is all that can be
My new world is ahead of me now
This is all that I've found
My new world keeps spinning me around
My new world keeps spinning me
And time is not my enemy
My new world is ahead of me today
And all things pass away ..."
6,Monica Naranjo,Perra Enamorada,TRNDYUT128F427CC37,2000,"Yo estoy tan sola
Perdida en el absurdo
De un amor amargo
Lejos de tu mundo
Sola, no, oh! .

Lloro si te sueño
Tiemblo al ver tu cara
Yo soy de mi dueño
Perra enamorada
Y sola .

Por amor
Yo soy capaz
De arrollidarme
De pedir perdon
De dar la vida
Pero, ¿quién me curará?
¿quién lamerá mi piel?
¿quién? .

Si me quedo sola
Te necesito ya

Huy!

Me abriré las venas
Se cerrará la tarde
Al ver tu corazón de yeso
Regado con mi sangre
Y abierto para darte así, sí, mi
Carne

!ah!
Por amor
Yo soy capaz
De arrollidarme
De pedir perdón
De dar la vida
Pero ¿quién me curará?
¿quién lamerá mi piel?
¿quién?

7,Vader,North,TRVICDC128F934B00C,2000,"I cut myself and still hurt
Grey pain still reminds
There is no Kingdom, Power, Glory
For those who freeze their lives behind

Following the wrong god I have been
Lusting for knowledge of the cold

North is closing down on me
At high noon and here

Fever, the northern lights of soul
Keeps driving thoughts to the pole
The fields of silence from my soul
Chilled neon blood in my mouth
The black clock makes tours of time
As I spend my days between the stations

North is closing down on me
At high noon and here
North is of heart and mind
My life frozen at zero"
8,VAST,What Else Do I Need,TRIDDNJ128E078B4E0,2000,"I don't mind that I have
Come back here again
In a place so far away
From normal life

They're racing to a prison
They will never leave
Worshipping a system
I just don't believe

I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

I know that you don't like me
That's all right today
I love you but you bore me
Don't fuck up my day

I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need

People worry that
I don't do anything
I think they really wonder
Why I'm not like them

Racing to a prison
They will never leave
Worshipping a system
I just don't believe

'Cause I could stay right here
And never ever leave
What else do I need
What else do I need
What else do I need"

(Chorus 1) (Sticky)
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns 
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns

Verse 1: (Sticky)

My dogs is my guns, 
they attack any nigga that comes or any niggas that rings
if my glocks on safe that means my dogs on the leash
Twenty shells in the clip, each bullet's the teeth
keep my dogs starvin', they ain't ate in days
keep my guns loaded, they can't wait to spray
my glock is a Rot, my Four-Fifth is a Pit
my D.E. a bullmaster, who wanna get bit?
when my guns spark that means I let 'em loose in the park
now let's see if your bite is as big as your bark
my Nine against your Nine to the death, have a dogfight
foamin' at the mouthpiece, run the streets all night
my dogs turn to razors up North
they don't wear collars, scratched the serial off
no owner, no dogtag, my dogs is illegal
they bite a hole in you so big you can see through
my dogs will even bark at this whole click
this a K-9, it eats it's own shit
they tried to put him to sleep, kids scared to pet 'em
I just say ""sick 'em"" and it pulls of and gets 'em

(Bridge) (Sticky)
My fuckin' guns, my fuckin' guns!
my dogs is my fuckin' guns!
rob you doggystyle with the gun in your back!
my dogs is my fuckin' guns!

(Chorus 2) (Blackchild)
My dogs is my guns, they'll chase you if you run
clear out the party, and bite somebody
they got niggas goin' to war for the cause
and you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
a dog ain't a Man's best friend, it's a Mac Ten
and my Mac Ten is my best friend
it got niggas goin' to war for the cause
and you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll

Verse 2: (Sticky)

I got two dogs, one named Nigga, one named Bitch
Bitch is the one with the pretty gold clip
Nigga's the one with the taped up grip
I'll make 'em empty simultaneous 'till you get hit
fuck fightin' in the streets, life is a struggle
put on a silencer, now they're wearin' a muzzle
I hate Puppies, little guns, I need power
you small time, a .22, you a Chiwauwa
teeth growin', bullets we never run out of
my dogs mate with new guns, I feed 'em gun powder
they ain't home trained, nor house broken
mouth open, droolin', that means the barrel is smokin'
I walk my dogs every night, prime-meridian
bust under water, they can swim, amphibian
turn 'em to a sawed-off, get their ears chopped off
my automatics a Pit with the locked jaw.

(Chorus 2 2x) (Blackchild)

(Chorus 1) (Sticky)

my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns 
my dogs is my guns
my dogs is my guns

(Bridge 2) (Sticky)

My dogs is my guns, I walk wit' 'em, talk wit 'em
go to court wit 'em, always in Newyork wit' 'em
I never leave 'em, eat wit' em, sleep wit' 'em
sit 'em on the sink nigga, take a leak wit' 'em

(Bridge 1) (Sticky)

My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
my dogs is my fuckin' guns!
my dogs is my fuckin' guns!
my dogs is my fuckin' guns!
bust your dogs, it's your fuckin' guns!"
10,Souls Of Mischief,Enemy Minds,TRWDSKJ128F4278BEA,2000,"(Opio)
Remember Tabitha Smith
That's been my hard on since the fifth grade
Used to tell me nigga get paid
So we could be chillin'
Knew she'd be a millionaire
Feelin' 'em squares, stayin' up late
Doing her homework
Till he bones hurt
Solid as steel
Real as a day of atonement
Never live for the moment
That's why suckers they couldn't bone shit
Fool that body's a temple
Plus her older brothers just might lynch you
If you slippin'
Dreams of tinted windows in a benz-o
Graduated valedictorian, still smokin' indo
She was a whiz though
And I admire it
Finished up grad school
Now she mob a jaguar too
She never led she'd get maniacal
Kept her eyes on true ambition
That's how she livin' fat
Educated herself
Now she in a rack with six figures
Stacks of cashola I told her

Chorus (Opio):

Stay hustlin'
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze
You might blink for a second
Stay alert they like green berets
Checkin' your traps
With impeccable accuracy
Know where you at &amp; where you be

(A-Plus)
Now everybody is a victim
If he a idiot I probably got a problem with him
About these women and that (pollyin'?) to get 'em
Maybe end up sorry that you hit 'em
Oh you was trickin' now a part of you is with 'em
I know plenty of those travel many roads
Went to extremes to receive every penny owed
Hella niggas be petty though
They eyes give 'em open and their actions let me know
So why give a fuck
All them answers lead to more questions
And if you're guessin' you's a poor specimen
More death to them
My demeanor changes
When I see the stages
Of a nigga schemin' before I beat him like Peter Gages
I listen to many morons, Let 'em go on
Wonder why they talk for so long they be like so on and so on
I examine who and what I think I know
Everybody's a victim is what I'm peepin' though, so
I hustle with friends
Even tussle with them
I ain't knowin' nothin' but them
Toughen the skin ha ha
Now it's all about your work ethic
In a word check it
In a word check it

Extended Chorus

(Opio)
Stay hustlin'
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze
You might blink for a second
Stay alert they like green berets
Checkin' your traps
With impeccable accuracy
Know where you at &amp; where you be
Back to the scene of the crime with rubber gloves on
Tryin' to expose the cover up but there was none
So when the fuzz come
We say what's up to 'em
Cuz we untouchable &amp; give a fuck

(Tajai)
V-12 pushin' like 80
Super sounds of Coltrane stainless
So I don't hydroplane
I kiss my lady and my baby
Told 'em things gon' be straight
Hopped out at the hospital gate
Now I'm a little late
But that can mean everything
Got an urgent page
Jetstream to the scene
Mask &amp; gloves plus (D green?) scrubs
Open you up for the peaking
Grab my instruments and start tweaking this and that
Then stitch you back to near perfection
Avoiding all complications and infections
My occupation, the culmination of strenuous concentration
Lots of lonely contemplation
No time for impatience when you dream makin'
My reward is smiling faces on all my patients
Mobility, ability, to make changes
In a community ravaged by the savage collaborations
Of racists, but y'all can't say shit
I'm a hustle till I drop one day may save your kids

Extended Chorus 2x

Repeated:
Stay hustlin, what

1x:
Legalize hustlin'
Yeah
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze"

And oh, I’m counting the days
You’ve got something that I’ve never since seen, a willing heart and a part that’s clean
We’re both good at counting days

With an ounce of intuition and your parents' ammunition
You come here hungry, wearing naked ambition
Hysterical to meet you
Can you get me in?

I got three years tied to the mast of this town, she's a handsome ship but I’m going down
And oh, she ain't coming with me
There’s a time to fight and a time to get out, you’ll fight 'til we’re all knocked out
And oh, I keep counting teeth

Everyone's an artist with a pristine vision
Cellular intelligencer, a fire in her kitchen
Too many chefs on dope
And the rich don’t listen

I am the rabbit
Wrapped in panic actor
Bag in a tree, you will outlast the cast and me
I gotta get some release

It’s up or out and the ladders on fire
She greased her frock with a smile that moves the sky

Surviving the insult day to day, they give you the insult to make it go away
And oh, what can I say?
I got a wine-swept smile and a well-timed mile, I've been running since I heard they’d sooner see us die
Than oh, come and die next to us

Up to her knees, men keep hitting
White suits fuck like bad television
Latest simple angel
Come die next to me

I am a shifting shape
A wire walker
Coked with the hopes of happy ever after
I came to trial out of style

But I got my eye on a country mile
Where the people you know are the ones you like"

There in the dark on the top of my roof
As the city's blue sound swept up from down under
Heat lightening flashed. Got me to wonder

Are the troubles that life has seen fit to give me
There to regret or there to remind me
I'm real. I'm a real man.

For so many years I believed I was broken
So medicine sweet and the leaves I was smoking
Told me I was strong, righteous and firm
But only if I comply and stay in the terms

With the deal made between weakness and shame
To shelter me from the price of my pain
I'm real. I'm a real man , yes I am.

And I'll do everything a man possibly can
To make a difference
I'll save my soul if you give me the chance
I'll rectify my dreams if you let me see my way clear

As I thank my higher power for all that she'd done
I sing to the water towers and to the rising sun
For every woman or car crash that ever broke me in two
For showing me that there's always a way through
And that I'm a real man, yes I am."

You and me

But I didn't read between your lines
And I didn't know there was no one like you to find

Why didn't I see
This before

Why didn't I call
Back for more

Now I do feel
The pain inside

And now I see
All I can do is hide and

Cry
All I can do is
Cry

Cry
All I can do is
Cry
Like this

Maybe one day I will realize
That you're gone

Maybe now I can see what my plight
Has become

The beginning of a lonely life

The beginning of a love
'Cause these words linger in my mind 

Why didn't I see
This before

Why didn't I call
Back for more

Now I do feel
The pain inside

And now, I see
All I can do is hide and

Cry
All I can do is
Cry
Like this

All I can do is

And it's easy to cry
I send a letter
But I get no reply
Just a note
Return to sender
We talk on tiptoe
Everytime that we meet
But I think breaking up
Is just a conciet
Because Love turns sour
Every hour

I stand all day
With a rose in my teeth
Give it to the first girl
That will say something sweet
She says thank you for the flower
It will die within the hour
Return to sender

I went looking for a priest
I said say something please
I don't wanna live my life
All alone
HE said god will take care
Of those that help them
Selves
But you look pretty
Screwed, send a letter

And the word
On the street
Is that death is complete
When you think that
You know where you're going
And the headline in my mind says
Patience for the blind
If you find us

Return to sender"

Moths flicker life into an empty dim lit street
Well this is somebody’s hometown
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Looking around I have to wonder
 
I can hardly breathe there’s a weight upon my chest
Feels like it’s pushing me down
Sucking out my breath
Just too many faces around here
That I don’t want to see
I’ve been looking for the heart of town
But the ringroads lead me round and round
 
Dreamers of Caribbean seas
Jumping in and jumping out it’s me
 
Like a fish out of the water
Like a kite without a breeze
 
Tell me, did you see the golden pavements?
Was I dreaming or did they gleam
Well whether you’re writing on the wall
Or just sitting on the fence
Get up, look around to me there’s no defense
 
Against Celtic brothers in their streams
Hooked and sent to Coventry
 
Like a fish out of the water
Like a kite without a breeze."

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At bein' on our own

Start a new life with the new wife

Tell them who they are
And of the fight so far

Paddies gonna win, Toronto, Kilburn
Sydney, Montserrat and Derry

Newfoundland or the Banna Strand of Kerry
Liverpool, Chicago, Manchester and Glasgow

Built those places and then sat

Holy smoker in the black chair
Setting of the smoke alarm
There's a killer down in Detroit
He had no face but left a name
Call me god just like you mean it
Cause now the world is mine to blame

The world is mine, the world is mine
The world is my world, the world is my world
The world is mine, this is my world

Dark places in a dark heart
And now it's pouring acid rain
I'll take a sentimental journey across my wrist to leaky veins
Well I can take you I can make you
You know it's down to us or them
Call me god this time you mean it
Cause I'm rising up again

Sex for sacrilegious priests, hypocritcal jesus freaks
I'm an angel's son with a loaded gun
I'm on a mission of mercy
I'm a killer, I'm a gun for hire
You're a sinner
And I'm the god of hell fire

Call me god, I'm the lord
You call me god, cause it's my world"

Wir waren viel zu geil, und dann ging alles ganz schnell
Wir waren völlig drauf total durchgeknallt
Und ha'm mit uns'rer Liebe den Strand beschallt

Mmhh, was würd' ich jetzt dafür geben
Diese kleine süße Lüge noch einmal zu erleben
Hand in Hand am Strand unsere Liebe zu beschwör'n
Und noch einmal deine Worte zu hören

Mon bébé oh mon chouchou isch liebe disch
Oh mon cherie du bist alles für misch

Du bist so schön, du bist so süpersexy

Am letzten Abend hast du mir den Himmel auf Erden versprochen
Du warst dir sicher, mein Herz ist gebrochen
Ich spiel' das Spiel aber genauso gut wie du
Und darum hör' mir jetzt mal zu

Oh mon amour hast du denn wirklich geglaubt
Du kleiner Sack hast mir die Unschuld geraubt

Olvidamos que para poder llegar al otro lado (al otro lado)

Y fracasos conseguidos en tiempo preterito

Porque ya no quiere vivir mas atardeceres (¿cuantas?)

¿Cuantas veces?.. porque ya no quiere vivir mas amaneceres

El bueno deja de ser bueno sin el malo

Puede empezar de nuevo
Da fruto  la semilla,
¿Por qué envejeces?
¿Por qué tu piel se va arrugando?

Sabes que la codicia puede dejarte en la ruina (uh huh)

Sensación a velocidad
De ilusión organica
Coincidencia armónica

No existe ningún borrador magico
Para borrar todos los errores cometidos
¿Qué pasaría si las flores solo se marchitaran
O sólo se quedaran como botones?
Duele la realidad, duele
La fantasía sólo se queda en los sueños
¿Qué pasaría si nunca muero y no tuviera la oportunidad de nacer de nuevo?

Amanece el alma
Vuelve otra vez, aparece
Atardece en tí
Desapareces, te vas y vuelves (x4)

You have gone so soon, like the moon.
You know what I miss? The old you.
You're a cold hearted-fool.
You swore to me that things were still cool. How untrue.
The cards have been dealt and my hand doesn't exactly rule.
As I looked at the sky, I was glad I didn't cry.
Love-- thrown away.
I'm happy that you are undauntedly mistreating me.
Look at my life you can't honestly say that I could
and it would be better for us both.
So what now I feel sick?
I was right, did I have to be so cruel, like the moon.
Hiding away as the sun shows the pain in the world.
Now my heart has been broke and you're the one crying.
Is this some sick joke?
Maybe next time someone dicks in your crotch you'll pray that he chokes.
Months-- thrown away.
You pissed on my trust and that's always the way that I'll see you and me.
And as it stands now that's the way that it always will be.
So we're done and in the end it wasn't all real fun.
You're the one who ended up not being the one.
and as time passes by, its stands ever still and I just can't figure out why.
Heartsick disease.
You hand-cooked me royally fucked with tomato and cheese.
I'm at ease, cause I don't care now.
Have fun the choice isn't me.
Good-bye again
as I tell myself over and over that's we'll still be friends, but I know
It won't be the same in the end.
Have fun in your life without me.
I know that I don't care about you."

Ain't that what I'm supposed to say
To learn from my mistakes
Awareness of the past in the way I live today
So how comes I still feel I've fucked up?
And even after all this time
As soon as I see your face
It brings back all the regrets that are still floatin' round my mind
Others say forget over time
But forget and stay blind

I can move on, I can be strong, but I still feel pain
Don't deny or act like it is just a game
Deal real to feel real
Deal real to feel real and look on
You gotta make your actions

Yeah it's good to progress and to move on
But remember the things that you said and actions that you wish undone
Life's long to act strong
Don't spend your time wishin' that we'll all see through you

If it's what you done you can't hide it
Cos it will take down with a little ha ha ha
If it's what you done you gotta live with it
Cos if it was all undone you'd never have to be strong
What's done, it may be shit
But shit can still heal

Don't spend your time acting fake and then stand wondering why you're alone
It's cos you're livin' a lie"

Grown my beard, I'm still a child
Dead ends shortcuts just the same,
I'm the master of my game
Predictable, now you may say,
The Danny Kaye of present day
Close my hand and wave my wand,
Brainchild of your wonderland

Now,
(Now) I'm at the peak
Never forget what I tell you
Never give in to the big sleep, fast becoming
Now,
I'm at the edge
Never reject what I offer
Never believe what they tell you, let's move a mountain

Now watch me fight, now watch me bleed,
A universal spiral seed
The progress lingers, thoughts of man--
Take it as far as humans can
(Now) think of me your solid dream,
Catch me floating down the river
I'm an island drifting by,
Time again your sole forgiver

Now,
I am the sun
I am the first day of summer
Never give in to the dark deep, fast becoming
Now, (now!)
I am the moon
I am the end of the tunnel
Never believe in the dark age, let's move a mountain

Call me ageless, call me ghost,
The diamond duke behind the shades,
Sunflower beneath the skyline
Swaying in the land of snakes
Hey, I used to be a king
Now I'm just a king of laughter
Put me faith in anything,
Anything that's close to wonder
Anything that's close to wonder...

I'm in the middle, now see what I done,
Staring into the sun
You think you're drowning, but slowly you slip
Through the grinders of time
Afternoon the upstream, begging for time
Hum the words ""I feed you my colorful shrine""

I'm in the middle, hold on to what's mine
In the limbo of time
You think you're dreaming, but gradually you learn
What it's like being torn
I'm on the other side painting skies to the poor
Hum the words ""I'll join you; we'll break down the scores""

Break down, down
(Break down, down)

Break down, down
(Break down, down)

Break down, down
(Break down, down)

Break down, down

(I left my heart in San Francisco... I left my mind at Brisco Bay)

She came from the islands, seen places afar
They said she was gifted, reading the stars
And though I'm certain she was telling the truth
She'd faint when the mob start rocking the boat

In time, your eyes will open,
And the curtains will drop
To see we are one, this one that we are
In time, your eyes will open,
And time will tell
Larger than life, revolve among stars

She came from a time, time running slow
Transcending the limits, step up to the flow
She brought to the table all the wonders of life
The year of the dragon, she opened her eyes

In time, your heart will open,
And you'll let her in
To see we are one, this one that we are
In time, our hearts will open,
And time will tell
Larger than life, revolve among stars"

She dreams of a world without danger,
Climbing the stairs to a room of her own

To figger out my head and what's in between

And feel this friendship fall
And feel my fist smash down the wall
And let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

Cuz when I stutter I am real really searching for words
With my shakin hands touchin my face
Cuz I'm hurting myself to take

Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste
Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here
The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud 
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house
With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring 
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Chorus: 
Chi town chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

Verse 2:

The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami
The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks 
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot
Cuz Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on yall
The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all 
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Chorus


Verse 3:

Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of yall run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But its a lot of shit to do with bitch...I did it
I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke
Its K Town times 22 next shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas get high
We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!!!

see my highschool pictures
and notice the difference
between now and the ol times
different lines
i was starvin' sold my body
was not warned at all
side effects are on the run
almost done
if i'm gonna die
you're gonna die by me
my face's changin' features
the company won't hear me
doctors are just on their side
keep tellin' lies
since the day i turned blue for a fee
money is not enough
i'm into it no more/again
i bet my cum is green
i want my life again X3"

oh his life has just begun
got a temper like a gun
pointing it at everyone
that's his game
and it helps him to get through the day
but a voice inside him says
how much longer can I play

chorus:

he's got infinite possibilities
I can see them now
it's the unbroken chains of his 
past by which he's bound
he's got infinite possibilities
I can feel them now
if he chooses well, then nothing 
can tear him down

peace of mind
is not easy for him to find
and he's walkin' a thinner line
in a place where another man is keeping his time
though he's young
he's not like everyone
he sees what he's become
and he'd rather be standing in the sun

{chorus}

with infinite possibilities
infinite...possibilities
stand in the sun and see"

And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around bloomin' heather
Will ye go, lassie, go

And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go, lassie, go

I will build my love a tower
Near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will ye go, lassie, go

And we'll all go together
To pluck wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather

I would surely find another
Eh to that wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Oh will ye go, lassie, go

I will wash it all away with my love
It's all she's ever needed from me
It's my time, to mother

One of my own, in my life... I am so alone
Left with no one in my life... I'm so alone

Life: Submissiveness, hypnotizing the ignorant!

'Least that's what she said...
Life of a simple man:
Taught that everyone else is dirty!
My love is meaningless!
I'm just a soiled, dirty boy!...
Just a soiled, dirty boy!

Sheltered life, innocence
Insulated memories spark reflections of my head
Duality in my consciousness, caught in the war
of hemispheres between love lost in my head

Mommy, do you still live inside of me?
I'm so lost in my life without any guiding
Protected me my whole life from everything
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine
To screen your dead eyes from me and -
-My sickness: Mutilate and sew my new clothes,
For masquerading... Aprons of flesh,
Corpse scalped hair, with skin upon my face!

Deliver the remains from the womb of earth
Prep the rack and tie up, for new love's rebirth
Covert understanding of novice surgery...
I'll focus concentration and only take just what I need -
-For this sickness: I'm masticating,
Dancing and masturbating...
Celebrate in fields of night, with skin upon my face!

If I soak my hands in others' blood, am I sick?

If I bathe myself in others' blood...

Blame Mother for the sickness
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading...
Aprons of flesh, corpse scalped hair, with skin upon my face!
Dance and masturbate in night light by myself!

They're coming to take me far away

És mondták, hogy győztünk. De csak a lesütött szemüket, a földre szegezett
Tekintetüket lestük, és láttuk: nem akad senki köztük, egy olyan,
Aki komolyan merné venni, hogy a vérébe' van, amit a szemével lát.
Valami azt súgja neki, hogy csak abban higgyen,
Akibe biztos, hogy nem fog beleszeretni – pedig a vérébe' van.
Tudja ő is.

Sosem voltunk senkik, mindenhonnan jöttünk,
Bárki szívesen maradna köztünk.
Sosem voltunk senkik.

Az idegen mindenhol idegen. De bárhová teszem,
Sosem hagy egyedül, átlát a szemeden. Az idegen
A haverod – őt nézd. Kilesi, ha néznek, figyeli, ha nő van,
És úgy érzi, közelebb menne; mindig észbe kap, hogy ezt
Nem ő írja – mások írják benne. A kapucnis arcok
Ülnek egy teremben, írnak, és égnek a lapok.
Az idegen szerint én szerelmes vagyok belétek… bennetek.
Hagyjátok, sosem voltunk senkik.

Mindenhonnan jöttünk.

I'm gonna tell you what my crew is all about
We like raw rhythm fusion, real rhyme producin'
Songs for the world's men, women and children
Armed and equipped with much confidence
And this is how we're gonna make our living
Some are known for bein' biters
Non creative and whack rhyme writers

Yo, they soup you up but can't rock the jam
Known to the world as a one hit band
Easy come, easy go, yo you had your turn
Temporary niggas touchin' up your perm
You see a rapper is a kid that brags and acts big
A rhymer is a nigga that can handle his biz
Yo, a rapper is a kid that's tryin' to be the shit
An entertainer ain't tryin' cause he already is

Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where art imitate life and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

We was rockin' a jam the other night
J-5 was on the mike so the people was hype
Yo, we like to rock the party with adrenalin and passion
The crowd started screamin', ""Action satisfaction""
Nu mark dropped the beat and the heat from the fire
We brought the energy and streetcar named desire

We was flippin', they was trippin', how we was old schoolin'
Needle to the groove, hands in the air movin'
Then we said to the crowd, ""This is the place to be
Whether you paid a fee or you got in free
So when you step through the door, the music gets loud
Maneuver through the crowd to get a better view now""

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where art imitate life and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

To be an MC, you got to be so fresh
To have style and finesse way above the rest
With the strong delivery, vocal chemistry
Street poetry in tune with the beat
So if you think you got the skills come take a test
Microphone check if you truly are blessed
If you can flow like water and can comprehend
You need longevity in this game to win
Now if you want to be the best you got to move and motivate

Watch the money that you make in the industry stakes
'Cause some of these people ain't got no class
And some of these folks'll make you beat they ass
If you can believe then you can achieve
Get the loot, live the dream, be on top of the scene
To keep the people in it, and accumulate fans
To be dope in the studio and slam at the jams, so

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where art imitate life and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

Welcome party people, while we got your attention
There's a few things we'd like to mention
The name is Jurassic, but they call us J-5
We rock bona fide fly rhymes fortified
We got two DJ s controlling the beat and
Vocal harmonies make it sound so sweet
We're the four horsemen, with words to caution
Expressed and flipped in an orderly fashion

With the rhymin', designin' the music on time
And the fellas saying, ""Ho"", and the ladies losin' they mind
And the breakin', the scratchin', this thing called rappin'
The cultivated music that keeps your hands clappin'
The passion, reaction, the street satisfaction
Brothers using no tactics to make it happen
The rhythm, the spirit, you love it when you hear it
Nowadays when you're samplin' shit, you gotta clear it

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where art imitate life and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

The poison in this town.
They raised us wrong,
They raised us strong,
They raised us up with arms 10 feet long.

I'm afraid we're Hansels.
I'm afraid we're cancelled and Gretteled.
I'm afraid we don't have the mettle
To make it in these woods.

Before we got a taste.

Yo I bring flows more rare than black quarterbacks
I never got sacked, or pushed ten yards back
We could go rhyme for rhyme, line for line or track for track
And after that, the crowd'll react
To the future we are the magnetic attract
Two-thousand twenty, confusin no doubt
I catch the story of your life on VH1 Where Are They Now?
And as for mine, I'll be sixty in my prime
Still science and theories, and droppin rhymes on time

Llévame en tu llavero
Para que pueda entrar a tu casa
O cuélgame en tu cadera
Para sentirme cerca del alma
Guárdame entre las hojas
De el principito, junto a mis cartas 
Pero, por favor no me olvides
No me dejes abandonada

Lleva la caricia y la virtud
Y los demonios nos importan, que demonios
Yo aprendí bien la lección
No jodo a nadie con mi cruz
Veo la rueda que se mueve lentamente
Y así estamos de repente en el norte o en el sur

Lleva, lleva y brinda a mi salud
Lleva, lleva, llévame amor
Lleva, las manzanas y el pastel

Y cuando llegues al pasado y al futuro
Y te des cuenta que los tuyos no son tuyos, no?
De quien?
Y esto se sabe, buena suerte compañero
Nadie sale vivo al ruedo,
Es una cuestión de fe

Lleva, que no hay nada que perder
Lleva, lleva, llévame amor
Llevame vos, llevo mucha nada en la valija

Llevá dolor, es preciso para amar
Llevame como yo te llevo
Under, así livianito
Llevame el fuego, no lleves mal
Y llevá transmisor
Para hablarme por si nos perdemos
Llevame calor y lleva mi corazón
A otro sentir en otro astral
Llévate la pena, es un don dejarse llevar
Déjate llevar, dejarse llevar

Lleva, que no hay nada que perder
Lleva, lleva, llévame amor
Lleva, llévame, llévame amor
Lleva, lleva el corazón la luz

The breath of nightly calm would cure my tumbling heart
You'd be frightened if you were here
To embrace my life - has to sear
The shore remains unmoved
By those rousing cries that are flirting with sleep
I've wandered to find
But still, still I'm not there
A journey so infinite
And still, still I'm not there
You'd be frightened if you were here
To encourage - life has to sear"

That pay backs from way back can
Hurt you like a motherfucker
Inside, outside, prepare for some retribution

Yeah, the revolution will not be televised
Or broadcast live on the net
My man Mos said it's personal.. knamsayin?
It's gotta start from right up in here, you know

(Mos &amp; Kweli)
You can't stop, you know (x3)
You can't stop when we rep

(Kweli)
We rep the ain't-gots
Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts
From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks
Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks
The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin
Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation
Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education
Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation

(Mos)
Yo
On the corner, units stormed out
Ghetto lookin bombed out
Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route
Shorties goin all out, they got they swords drawn out
Ready to brawl out, gettin fought til they fall out
Black like Morehouse, 40 o'z is tossed out
For brothers that they mourn bout, get wrecked til it's dawn out
Whether they broke or flossed out, honeys pass they draws out
Lookin for a ticket out the poor-house
A jungle out here
Lions keep they claws out, fangs and jaws out
Weak just get forced out
Names is called out, ghetto-fame is sought out
You wanna be the man that they talk bout
I walked out
I had some things on my mind to sort out
I thought bout the wild circumstance we born out
Remember myself at your age, when I was just like you
If that was now, I don't know what I would do
My answer's? closest to me
So what I say to you is goin for me
Son we both still growin indeed
But where you at, I was, and where you been, I left
Utilize my experience to guide your step
Some people get love but don't command respect
It's somethin that you can't ride with a check
Over-rollin your lex or icy links that hang from your neck
If it's real, who need to deal with the special effects?

(Kweli)
Come here, come here, yo
Lemme drop this on ya, look they gotchu cornered
The corner of the block is hot, I ain't got to warn ya
'Cause I see you every day, trapped in every way
'Shit, I'm a thug, and that's all that I can say'
Who are you anyway?
Mary J.? I spend, many nights awake, watchin you while you sleep
Tryin to figure out how to be the example, 'cause talk is cheap
As you walk the streets, study cats on the real
In a convo, just make your point to relax and chill
(Niggas) wanna destroy each other in a cypher instead a' build
Be a- man of will, don't be- standin still
If you- don't plan ahead, then you- plan to fail
Do ? in a daze when the ways reveal
Like they funny style but I'm not laughin
Serious (niggas) makin money while the police is passin
Can't wait for opportunity to knock, you gotta make it happen
It ain't about no spectacular ways a' rappin
Just immaculate ways a' action.. dig?

With fine carved wood and carpets like clouds on the floor,
And ride around in gold-plated automobiles,
With a flunky to drive and a flunky to open the door.

It's hard to believe, but people do live that way,
And that's why thousands live on the river bank,
And have hardly enough to eat from day to day.

It's hard to believe that thousands live in such shanties
Or are jammed into slums where we do not usually go,
And they don't know how they'll make it to the next pay-day,
If they have a pay-day, that is, when things get slow.

It's hard to believe but people do live that way,
And that's why a few live in real palaces,
And cannot spend money as fast as they get it,
No matter how hard they try,
Or how many houses and automobiles they buy."

And people I meet, they always go their separate ways.
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink,
And times when I'm alone, all I do is think.

Get down, I'm a cowboy and on a steel horse I ride,
I'm wanted, wanted... dead or alive.

I play for keeps, 'cause I never make it back.

Hay algunas de verdad
Y asesinos ojos negros

Y hoy yo sin ellos no me voy

Me lo quiero robar
Todo el tiempo soñando
Ya no puedo esperar
Desde que te encontre te estoy mirando
No paras de mirarme tu tambien
Un poco yo te entiendo no cualquiera
Se pondria de pie
Dejo su copa en una barra vieja
De a poco se paro mirandome
Sonriendo se acercaba lentamente
Pero se fue con el!!!
Yo quiero nacer de nuevo
Que alguien me pueda explicar
Como esos ojazos negros
Terminaron yendose del bar
Con el mas guapo del lugar
Todo el dia pensando
Como pudo pasar?
Todo el dia buscando
Quien me lo va a explicar?
Se fue con el
Se gana y se pierde nena
Perose fue con el

Elige la vereda de enfrente
Lo queria para mi
Es un amor sincero, y con los mismos miedos

I never took the time to notice
That I was always wrong and you weren't
You were the one who gave up so many things
Took you for granted
But you understanded
It was just a phase

And I've got a new direction
A blueprint for erection of a new life
It's such a simple situation
Some kind of masturbation
With a new twist
I don't know why

I've got it all figured out
We can make it
And I'll never let you down
Just take my hand
And understand
There's a lot of tomorrows

I let you down
You had no complaints
Watched as the world went spinin'
Around without you
You waited for me
You wanted diamonds
I came up with rollerblades
Shot down again but you smiled
And shook your head
And knew that I'd change"

Claiming a life everyday

And I won't be feeling hollow for so long
Nevermore to feel the pain

Just believe when you can't believe anymore

We hope, we hold and cannot allow the corrupt ecletic
Takes his fatal bow

Bien,... vete y apaga la luz

Tengo una invitación para viajar a un nuevo mundo
Será la solución para enterrarte en un segundo
Cerca de Shibuya olvidaré tu amor y encontraré un nuevo océano
Un huracán de sensaciones pop, algo nuevo, diferente y muy moderno
Espero veros allí.....

Es realmente imprevisible, nuestro mundo es increíble
Nos volvemos invisibles si queremos huir de ti
Es realmente alucinante, mi victoria es aplastante
Ahora soy interesante y me acuerdo de ti
Caprichosa y patética, niña pija frenética
No entendiste mi estética, ...pero me enseñaste a vivir...

To blankets and sheets

Make sure I know who's taking you home

I'm reading your note over again
And there's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
I will love you always and forever

Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
Making out

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending

I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
And I am alone
In my defeat 
I wish I knew you were safely at home

Peut-il aimer jamais

Du jour au lendemain
Que je sais aujourd'hui
Qu'on peut mourir demain

On a beau tout avoir
L'argent, l'amour, la gloire
Il y a toujours un soir
Où l'on se retrouve seul
Seul au point de départ

Jusqu'à ce que j'en crève

You against me? No contest, my tongue hydraulics 
Strong enough to flip a sixty-four Impala with three adult passengers 
And a four-hundred pound driver 
And drown you in less than an ounce of your own saliva 
Rubber-faced rappers get 
Stretched like elastic Claymation characters with verbal vernacular 
Slapping you like a white-water rafter or an Olympic kayaker 
Paddling across the Niagara 
My afterburners should be burning you after your body's already been splashed with acid 
And you turn into ashes 
Assassins camouflaged in the grass blasting 
Leaving blood all over your lady like Jackie Onassis 
I fly your body out of Dallas 
Perform plastic surgery while we're airborne and switch caskets 
Then lie to the masses
I tell them that you got murdered over some East-West beef between rappers 
Radio stations'll express they sadness 
Play classics back to back and pass out ‘stop the violence' pamphlets 
Just imagine, every night your girl's fucking your best-friend 
While you're in Hell, throwing tantrums 
I be lamping in a mansion, somewhere out in the Hamptons 
Giving some pretty-ass bitch a spanking 
Nigga you can't win, I'm laughing ‘cause you a has-been 
You can't get your groove back, so don't even bother asking Angela Bassett 
You'll just get your ass kicked, get your head chopped off, and dropped in a basket 
My left arm's taken but my right one's free 
That means I can diss another motherfucking emcee 
With rhymes that appear clearer than liquid crystal 
My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels 
I fire pistols, hit you with miniature missiles 
Riddle your body with holes, then watch the blood trickle 
You probably had no idea what you was getting into 
‘Cause on the mic, Can-I-Bus is invincible 
Fuck you

Creeping wit a four-five and reaching for your door knob
Throw a gun under ya chin, see how quick your whore rise
One shot could have a short slide, right out the North side
Your whole flow is porkrine, spit the small oints
I'm nasty, but my small joints grip the bar point
Drop on top of the blue line..right beside the red one
Keep the flow fairsome, 'til the day my career done
Bring it to your ass if you the challenging type
Especially those surrounding the mic, sounding alike
To the Journ, y'all ain't no suitable spitters, true to you niggas
