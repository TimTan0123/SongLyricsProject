But Lord how that horse can run 
Yes she win every race
Man you don't see how it's done 

I give her three gold teeth
I put earrings in her ears
 There ain't no use a‑worrying
I do swear the stuff is here

  I cut her mane
I put streamline shoes on her feet 
Ain't a horse in the country
I do swear my horse can't beat

  Say she foxtrot and pace
And I rode that horse today
 Yeah when morning comes
She had never broke her gait

  She going to the race track at midnight
And I rode her all night long
 Yeah when morning come
She had never changed her weight

  She's a coal‑black mare
She's got long black curly mane
Well I'll follow that horse
Man in any land"
1,Big Bill Broonzy,Key To The Highway,TRKWNIH128F92FB844,1941,"I got the key to the highway, and I'm billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin', cause walkin' is most too slow

I'm goin' down on the border, now where I'm better known
Cause woman you don't do nothin', but drive a good man 'way from home

Now when the moon creeps over the mountain, I'll be on my way
Now I'm gonna walk this old highway, until the break of day

Come here, sweet mama, now and help me with this heavy load
I am due in West Texas, and I've got to get on the road

I'm goin' to West Texas, I'm goin' down behind the farm(?)
I'm gonna ax the good Lord what evil have I done"
2,Big Joe Williams,Peach Orchard Mama,TRMPQIA12903CB0DFD,1941,"Peach orchard mama, you swore wasn't nobody gonna use your peaches but me

You done got me to the place, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down

Well, well, get up in the mornin', hoo-well, peach orchard mama, she's on my mind

Got a man to buy your groceries and another joker to pay your rent
She's got a man to buy your groceries and another joker's payin' your rent
Well, you got me workin' in your orchard, hoo-well, well, and bringin' you every cents

I wonder what's the matter with that woman. Play it!

Play it a little while"

I'm gwine back to St. Louis, I'm gon' sit right down

'Cause I'm a crawlin' king snake, gon' joint all 'round your door
Play it for me a while, boy

Play 'til my baby comes. Ease on out"

7,Billie Holiday,Gloomy Sunday,TRHHTKK12903CF430A,1941,"Sunday is gloomy,
My hours are slumberless,
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday.

Gloomy is sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad,
I know, let them not weep,
Let then know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream,
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday."
8,Billie Holiday,God Bless The Child,TRAMSSR128F9332EAA,1941,"Them that's got shall have
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible says and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Yes the strong get smart
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends 
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money you've got lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Here just don't worry about nothing cause he's got his own
Yes, he's got his own"
9,Billie Holiday,Solitude,TRNCJQO128F9340F48,1941,"In my solitude you haunt me 
With reveries of days gone by 
In my solitude you taunt me 
With memories that never die 

I sit in my chair 
Filled with despair 
Nobody could be so sad 
With gloom ev'rywhere 
I sit and I stare 
I know that I'll soon go mad 

In my solitude 
I'm praying 
Dear Lord above 
Send back my love"
10,Champion Jack Dupree,Junker Blues,TRFZOZO128F933EF5F,1941,"My, my, I'm sick as I could be

Some people call me a junker
'Cause I'm loaded all the time
I just feel happy
And I feel good all the time

Some people say I use a needle
And some say I sniff cocaine
But that's the best old feelin' in the world
That I'd ever seen

Say good-bye, good-bye to whiskey
Lord and so long to gin
I just want my reefer
I just wanna feel high, again

Oh yeah, I'm a junker
I feel alright

Some people, some people crave for chicken
And some crave for porterhouse steak
But when I get loaded
Lord, I won't want my milk and cake

Oh yeah, that's all I want, now
They call me a junker
'Cause I'm loaded all the time
But that mean nothin' if I feel good all the time"
11,Memphis Minnie,In My Girlish Days,TRINQZZ128F426EBFD,1941,"In My Girlish Days


Late hours at night, trying to play my hand 
Through my window, out stepped a man 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 

My mama cried, papa did, too 
Oh, daughter, look what a shame on you 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 

I flagged a train, didn't have a dime 
Trying to run away from that home of mine 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 

I hit the highway, caught me a truck 
Nineteen and seventeen, when the winter was tough 
I didn't know no better 
Oh boys 
In my girlish days 

All of my playmates is not surprised, 
I had to travel 'fore I got wise 
I found out better 
And I still got my girlish ways"
12,Memphis Minnie,Me And My Chauffeur Blues,TRVXFUG12903CAAF87,1941,"Won't you be my chauffeur?
Won't you be my chauffeur?
I wants him to drive me
I wants him to drive me downtown
Yes, he drives so easy
I can't turn him down

But I don't want him
But I don't want him
To be ridin' these girls
To be ridin' these girls around
So I'm gonna steal me a pistol
Shoot my chauffeur down

Well, I must buy him
Well, I must buy him
A brand new V8
A brand new V8 Ford
Then he won't need no passengers
I will be his load

Yeah, take it away

Going to let my chauffeur
Going to let my chauffeur
Drive me around the
Drive me around the world
Then he can be my little boy
Yes, I'll be his girl"

But don't you lie to me 
Don't you lie to me

If you gimme yours, too

14,The Andrews Sisters,Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,TRNDSDA128F9321688,1941,"(Don Raye - Hughie Prince)

He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

A-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddelyada-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'im
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a 'bzzz' bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

Toot-toot-toot, toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada
Toot, toot, he blows it eight-to-the-bar
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'im
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

(Instrumental interlude)

He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

Da-dah-da-dah-da
Da-dah-da-da-dah-da
Da-dah-da-da-da

A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B!"
15,Tommy McClennan,Cross Cut Saw Blues,TRBPKZJ128F92D2C03,1941,"Now I'm a cross-cut saw, drag me 'cross your log
I'm a cross-cut saw, drag me 'cross your log
I'll cut your wood so easy, can't help but say, ""Hot dog""

They call me ""Wood 'n' Cuttin' Slim"", call me ""Wood 'n' Cuttin' Dan""
But the woman I did wood 'n' cuttin' for, she wants me back again
'Cause I'm a cross-cut saw, babe, and drag me 'cross your log

Try my cross-cut saw, here, will ease on through the wood
'Cause I'm a cross-cut saw, babe, and drag me 'cross your log
I'll cut your wood so easy, can't help but say, ""Hot dog""

Now I'll cut your wood in the mornin', cut your wood late at night
I'll cut your wood 'bout the time I want thing called a fuss-and-fight
'Cause I'm a cross-cut saw, babe, and drag me 'cross your log
I'll cut your wood so easy, can't help but say, ""Hot dog"""

Ernestime a good-lookin' woman, holler she lives up on that hill
She been tryin' to quit poor Tommy, whoa, Lord, but I love her still

She walks the street late at night, she won't treat nobody right
She walk the streets ev'y night, she sure ain't gonna treat nobody right
Oh, she drinks that moonshine whiskey, but me an' her'll make ev'ything all right

Ernestime, if you quit Mr. Butler, we will make everything all right
Ernestime, if you quit Mr. Butler, we'll make everything all right
If I can't see you today, we may get together tomorrow night

Now you can read my letter, oh, but you can't read my mind
Ernestine, you can read my letter, now-now, but I swear you can't read my mind
Sometime you think I'm crazy 'bout you, I'm liable to be quittin' you all the time

Now that's all right, baby, what you did last Sunday night
I say that's all right, Ernestine, what you did one Sunday night
If I had've been in my whiskey too, it liable to cause a fuss and a fight
Spoken: Play the box now, son"
