Had to stick around to play

Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Cant leave my woman alone

Dont know what I'm missing
But I wouldnt miss the kissing
With lily cause she looks so fine

Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Cant leave my woman alone

Walking with my lily
Down a road thats pretty chilly
But she makes it like a summer day

Down on the bay
Thats where I stay
The clouds are gray
Down on the bay
And thats my home
Cant leave my woman alone

Sure look so delighted
And I'm getting so excited
Every time you start to play
Down on the bay

Down on the bay
Thats where I stay

A-sittin on the bay
Thats where I stay
Thats where I stay

Down on the bay
Thats where ill stay

Down on the...

It ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine
It ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely

It ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine

What can you do when those tears make you blind
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely

What can you do with these crying eyes of mine"
2,J.J. Cale,Bringing It Back,TROPHXC128F145A649,1971,"Saturday, past September
In the jailhouse, I remember 
I got caught with too much soul
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico

Spanish lights and pretty faces
Trip you out to where the place is
Load you up and let you go
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico

Across the border is where you get her
The wine's good, there ain't no better
I think I'll get me some to go
Bringing it back from Mexico
Bringing it back from Mexico"
3,Sly & The Family Stone,Family Affair,TRTLZAR128F4267D14,1971,"It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn

Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Over there, over there

Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh-huh

You can't leave 'cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay 'cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry 'cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway 'cause you're all broke down

It's a family affair

Honey, welcome back home.

I know she told you,
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did,
But all I know is that she left you,
And you swear that you just don't know why,
But you know, honey I'll always,
I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh honey, welcome back home.

Don't you know, honey,
Ain't nobody ever gonna love you
The way I try to do ?
Who'll take all your pain,
Honey, your heartache, too ?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh daddy, like you always seem to do.

And when you walk around the world, babe,
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road,
You might find out later that the road'll end in Detroit,
Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu.
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,
When you only gotta do one thing well,
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.
You got a woman waiting for you there,
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe,
I know you got more tears to share, babe,
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
And cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby.

And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear,
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now,
And if you ever want a little love of a woman
Come on and baby baby baby babe babe baby now
Cry baby yeah."
5,Faces,Sweet Lady Mary (LP Version),TRUSTHC128F9341BD3,1971,"Sweet Lady Mary has to rest her poor head
Wakes in the morning with her breakfast in bed
I tried to help her but I did not know how
I tried to love her but it's all over now

Nothing left to comfort me
Except a sunny day
Steal away
Steal away

Over the stones along the dusty old road
With every footstep one more tale is told
With every turning one more side to see
Sweet Lady Mary's seen the last of me

A lesson is learnt
I'll never come this way again
I'll steal away
Steal away

Her Spanish habits are so hard to forget
The lady lied with every breath, I accept
Was a matter of time before my face did not fit
I knew all along I'd have to quit.

Anyway now, I better not
Waste anymore of your time
I'll steal away
Steal away

I think I'll go back home and start all again
Where the Gulf Stream waters tend to ease the pain
And on a new day when I've mended the wound
Sweet Lady Mary's gate I swear I'll be bound

But before I sit down again 
And waste anymore of your time
I better steal away
Steal away"
6,Black Sabbath,After Forever,TRLLBPN128F9344596,1971,"Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you are dead 
You just stay in your grave

Is God just a thought within your head 
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book
When you were in school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath 
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope 
Do you think he's a fool?

Well I've seen the truth, yes I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared 
At the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that
God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize
That he's the one

The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late"
7,Emitt Rhodes,Love Will Stone You,TRBSUKT128F931F4D1,1971,"Rhodes

Standing looking through a hole in the door
It's a wonder you're still alive
You've been sitting thinking too long 'bout to drive you mad
You can't help but love her and you know you're not the only man.

There ain't no one that can lift your spirits
There ain't no one that can make you whole
'Cause your woman's gone and left you alone
Love will stone you but you'll come down.

There ain't no one that can feel your sadness
There ain't no one who will ease your pain
'Cause your woman's gone and left you again
Love will stone you but you'll come down.

Standing looking through a hole in the door
It's a wonder you're still alive
You've been sitting thinking too long 'bout to drive you mad
You can't help but love her and you know you're not the only man.

There ain't no one who can share your sorrow
There ain't no one who will make you sane
'Cause your woman's gone and left you again
Love will stone you but you'll come down.

Love will stone you but you'll come down.

Standing looking through a hole in the door

You've been sitting thinking too long 'bout to drive you mad

8,Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen,Hot Rod Lincoln,TRHCPSP12903CC5149,1971,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright.
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,
I shoved it on down into overdrive.

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin',
And down in the dips she started to rockin'.
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"""

Misused

You slippling through my fingertips

Abused yeah

Well, I don't mind that they're lucky
But it seems that they always win
And gamblin' is illegal in the state of mind I'm in
And if I had a nickel for each time that
I've been put on
I would be their nickel man
And I'd sing a little song

They're only putting in a nickel and
They want a dollar song
They're only putting in a little to
Get rid of a lot that's
Wrong.

Well I don't know so many things
But I know what's been goin' on
We're only putting in a little
To get rid of a lot that's wrong

At the Sunday morning market 
You were sorting through the odds and ends. 
You was looking for a bargain

I heard your footsteps at the front door,
And that old familiar love song,
Cause you knew you'd find me waiting there 
At the top of the stairs.

I went there and back
Just to see how far it was 
And you, you tried to tell me 
But I had to learn for myself.

Theres more trouble at the depot, 
With the general workers union 
And you said, ""They'll never change a thing.
Well, they won't fight and their not working.""

Oh you was my hero 
How you are my good friend 
I've been there and back 
And I know how far it is

But I left you on the Debris 
Now we both know you got no money. 
And I wonder what you would have done 
Without me hanging around."

Billed out and bound to go
Gonna leave here runnin'
Walking is most too slow

I'm going back, back to the border
Where I'm better known
I'm going back to the border, baby
And all you can do is mourn

When the moon peeps over the mountain
Yes baby, I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roll this highway until the break of day

When I was so long, so long, baby
Yes baby, I must say goodbye
I'm gonna roam this highway until the day I die

Give me one more kiss, baby
Yes, before I go long
When I leave this time
I ain't comin' back no more"
15,Gene Clark,1975,TREVCRI128F1477268,1971,"With all the legends that the century sings
And it's vision bring to life
While foreign waters breathe against the shore
And the wind plays ore it's rusted fife
I see the ships of a friendly fleet
And a song so sweetly sounding
And gentle souls who think not to defeat
As across the waves they are bounding

And then the thoughts of all the days this time
They have been confined without reason
And in the matters of their health and wealth
They cannot be defined but as treason
But go where and find the better life
As in the name of love you have freed them
Nd those you need not you have left behind
And those you keep in mind you know to heed them

Across the bridge, across the river
Where we've never been before
Within and out of worlds around us
And in the light of finding more
We always easy understood that
It was no good not to explore
But never really understood that
It was no good just to ignore"
16,Anne Briggs,Willie O Winsbury,TRFMBZH128F4259486,1971,"The king had been a prisoner
And a prisoner long in Spain,
And Willie of the Winsbury
Has lain long with his daughter at hame.

""What ails ye, what ails ye, my daughter Janet,
Why you look so pale and wan?
Oh have you had any sore sickness
Or yet been sleeping with a man?""

""I have not had any sore sickness
Nor yet been sleeping wi' a man.
It is for you, my father dear,
For biding so long in Spain""

""Cast off, cast off your berry-brown gown,
You stand naked upon the stane,
That I may ken ye by your shape
Whether you be a maiden or none.""

And she's cast off her berry-brown gown,
She stood naked upon the stone.
Her apron was low and her haunches were round,
Her face was pale and wan.

""Oh, was it with a lord or a duke or a knight
Or a man of birth and fame?
Or was it with one of me serving men
That's lately come out of Spain?""

""No, it wasn't with a lord, nor a duke, nor a knight,
Or a man of birth and fame.
But it was with Willie of Winsbury,
I could bide no longer alone.""

And the king he has called on his merry men all,
By thirty and by three,
Says, ""Fetch me this Willie of Winsbury,
For hanged he shall be.""

But when he came the king before,
He was clad all in the red silk.
His hair was like the strands of gold,
His skin was as white as the milk.

""And it is no wonder,"" said the king,
""That my daughter's love you did win.
If I was a woman, as I am a man,
My bedfellow you would have been.""

""And will you marry my daughter Janet
By the truth of your right hand?
Oh, will you marry my daughter Janet?
I'll make you the lord of my land.""

""Yes, I will marry your daughter Janet
By the truth of my right hand.
Yes I will marry your daughter Janet,
But I'll not be the lord of your land.""

And he's mounted her on a milk-white steed
And himself on a dapple grey.
He has made her the lady of as much land
As she'll ride in a long summer's day."

labrando tierra tendrás tu pan.
Todos los ríos van al mar
pero éste nunca se llenará.

Todos los ríos
siempre volverán a donde salieron,
para comenzar a correr de nuevo.
Lo que siempre fue lo mismo será,
lo que siempre hicieron repetirán.

No olvidar,
lo que ves ya se ha visto ya.
Tal vez un día lo sabrás
todo tiene un tiempo bajo el sol.

Porque habrá siempre
tiempo de plantar y de cosechar,
tiempo de hablar, también de callar.
Hay tiempo para guerra y tiempo de paz
tiempo para el tiempo y un rato más.

Buenas y malas son,
cosas que vivo hoy.
No es ésta tierra, no
sueño color azul.
¿No es quizás que no sé mirar?
Cuanto, cuanto hay a mi alrededor,
más de lo que mis ojos pueden mirar
y llegar a ver.
Estas son razones que dicen que:
Sólo sé,
que sé querer.
Y que tengo Dios
y tengo fe.
Y que doy amor
y puedo ser...

Sé que en algún lugar
alguien me espera hoy.
Sé que ahora tengo yo
alguien a quien buscar.

The sun shines most the time
And the feeling is lay back
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know I keep thinking about
Making my way back

Well, I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine but it ain't home
New York's home but it ain't mine no more

I am... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair

I am... I cried
I am... said I
And I am lost
And I can't even say why
Leaving me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king
And then became one?
Well, except for the names and a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story's the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried but it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared for the sound of being alone

I am... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair

And I am lost
And I can't even say why

There's a young man thinking by a window
How was she to know just how much he cared
He always knew just what he could do
He always knew that his dream would come true

Alexander Graham Bell well, he knew darned well
That he could find the only way to talk across the USA
Telephone, telephone never be on your own
Many many years ago he started something with his first ""Hello, hello""

The sun rises early in the morning
Millions of people still unaware
Of something he discovered without warning
So he could show a girl just how much he cared
He always knew just what he could do
He always knew that his dream would come true

Alexander Graham Bell well, he knew darned well
That he could find the only way to talk across the USA

24,Lucio Dalla,Un Uomo Come Me,TRYTNRI128F429B473,1971,"Un uomo come me
Se ha sete beve vino
Se ha fame chiede il pane al suo vicino

Un uomo come me
Quando regala un fiore
Non è un fiore comprato ma è colto sotto al sole

Un uomo come me
La casa dove è nato
L'abita senza luna quando dorme sul prato

Un uomo come me
Sorride e parla poco
Perchè legge nei tuoi occhi e poi capisce il gioco

Un uomo come me
Ha un buco dentro il cuore
Lo senti gridare ma non credi all'amore

A un uomo come me
Quando ti dice addio
Tu dici arrivederci e pensi e' ancora mio

Un uomo come me
Aspetta il tuo ritorno
Liberando nel vento una rondine al giorno

Un uomo come me
Si allontana di sera
Credeva fosse inverno e muore a primavera

by Carole King

Whispering wind came uninvited
Looking for somewhere else to go
Here is a lamp I've left unlighted
Aren't you someone I should know?

Memory's flame is soon ignited
Lighting my lamp with amber glow
Quietly friends are reunited
Singing a song of long ago, la la la...

Cry, cry for someone
Who just can't be happy
And be glad you can feel enough to cry

Younger than always, time descended
Bringing me brand new seeds to sow
Now that they've been a long time planted
What must I do to help them grow?

If it had been as I intended
I wouldn't have the peace I know
Loving the people I've befriended
Singin' a song of long ago, la la la...

As it began, so I will end it
Singing a song of long ago
Loving the people I've befriended
And singin' a song of long, long, long ago"

Shifting in the breeze
Some folks think it's make believe
Other folks ain't so naive
About a smoke signal
Could see it coming
A smoke signal
Hear the drums drumming

You don't believe what you read in the paper
You can't believe the stranger at your door
You don't believe what you hear from your neighbor
Your old neighborhood ain't even there no more

Indian maid will plant the seed
And cultivate a whole new breed
There's a smoke signal
Over your head
A smoke signal
You know what it said?
When they're torn out by the roots
Young brothers join in cahoots
To send a smoke signal
Near and far
A smoke signal
No matter where you are

You don't believe what they say on the radio
You don't believe what you see on the video
Living in the shadow of a doubt today
Still waiting for the smoke to clear away

Tried to get in touch with you
Tried to get my message through
By smoke signal
Honey, do ya read me

Call me if you need me
There you were all in white
Standing out in the broad daylight
Lookin' like a smoke signal
From heaven above

And they really make a mess outa you

And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she steals your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you here
And man they expect the same

They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into getting up and leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived down here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first

Like some prophecy forgotten by an age
With no guns before its gate
The mysterious estate
Lies waiting for its history's dawning page
With the raging of the sea before its height
And the strength of those whom see beyond their sight
Oh, the smithies anvil rings
And the symphony it sings
No voice nor poet's pen can put to tune
And electric lines of force
Ring around the humble lives
Of the souls that hear the master saying soon
With the clouds that gather near disturb the night
Striking flashes of a difference, fleeing fright
No slight of tongue nor hand
Can so boldly there withstand
When the spirit of it's truth shall speak the time
And no ignorance of life
Can be held within the sight
Of the buttresses of ageless binds of time
The communion of the forces take delight
With the fear that no tongues may read nor write
White Light
Oh the village of the hill
Sitting silently still
With the strength of ages past they're still at hand
Reckons not to look behind
But to look within and find
And to hear of those enlightened by the lamb
With the powers of the wind both fierce and light
And the waters of the storm went through the night"

Voices of time bringing surprise
Voices that sing in waking moments
To look into life's eye

Aren't you glad it's another day
Look and tell
So you though you would run away
But you know that way too well

In the midwinter wind

For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win

Ah, ah-ah ...

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God

And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life

Ah, ah-ah ...

But she would not think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end

For she's the mother of all men
Who counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay

Ah, ah-ah ...

Oh, lady, lend your hand outright
Oh, let me rest here at your side
""Have faith and trust in peace,"" she said
And filled my heart with life

""There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured, I won't be far away""

Ah, ah-ah ...

Thus, having spoke, she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black coat disappear

My labour is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I'll find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day

And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize
And say hello for me

And I was brought up in London town, a place of noted fame
I was beloved by all my men, kings and princes likewise
And then all the towns we took to all the world's surprise

King Charles the Second I did serve to face our foes in France
And at the battle of Ramillies we boldly did advance
The sun was down, the earth did quake, so loudly did he cry
""Fight on, my boys, for old England's sake, we'll conquer or we'll die""

But now we gain for victory and bravely kept the field
We took great numbers of prisoners and forced them all to yield
That very day my horse got shot, 'twas by a musket ball
And as I mounted up again, my aide-de-camp did fall

Maybe you think I look a tramp
Or maybe you think I'm 'round to steal a car
But no, I'm not a crook
And if you think that's what I look
I'll tell you why and what my motives are

I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

She's wonderful, she's marvelous
She's fabulous, she's beautiful
And anyone can understand why
I'm leaning on the lamp post at the corner of the street
In case a certain little lady comes by

She doesn't always get away
She cannot always get away
But anyway I know that she'll try
Oh me, oh my
I hope that little lady comes by

She's not the kind of girl to be late for
But this girl I'd break any date for
I won't have to ask what she's late for
She'd never leave me flat
She's not a girl like that

She's wonderful, she's marvelous
She's fabulous, she's beautiful

Seem to follow me wherever I go

Piercing me right through the core

You know you love her more and more""

They wonder how does a man get to be this way

And everytime they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing

To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

To be the bad man
To be the sad man

55,Pearls Before Swine,Wedding (Album Version),TRVTNJL128F4241DFE,1971,"The aisle it was long and dark, garbage cans kept the watch
The chapel walls were old and lined and the streetlamp lit its mouth
The altar was the lesser half of an old forgotten couch.

The bride stumbled nervously, a box fell in her flight
She cursed her trusting foolishness for leaving the sanctuary of the light
A crumbled linen handkerchief, a little girl's fright.

The groom followed slowly and the wine dripped from his chin
Panting that the holy doors would part and let him in
His candle burned with whiteness, stiff and violent.

The sound of breath in darkness gave away the bride
His eyes said : 'I am the body' - and her's said : 'I am the blood'
And as the candle pushed below, exploding wax and fear
The handkerchief fell from her hands and as usual there were tears."

Settle down in a relaxing town

You got to tell the children the truth

From the album YEAR OF SUNDAY (1972). 

On a crisp as bacon morning with the sunshine on my head,
From the twilight of the dawning raised myself up from my bed.
Fixed mine eyes upon a favor like no mortal eye behold,
Then I chose to taste the flavor of the ancient of the old.

On a chill as winter evening in a doubtful circumstance,
He stopped the evil breathing of a one time's serpent's chance.
Old black sea with silver lining how I long with all my soul,
To quaff the mystic fragrance of the ancient of the old.

From a red as amber burning with a chalice in my hand,
I know there is no turning I must now obey command.
At last decree has destined now the mystery untold,
Will shine in all its glory from the ancient of the old."
63,Pearls Before Swine,The Man (Album Version),TRBSPGV128F4241DF8,1971,"I am just a crewman, you can listen to my story if you want to
I started out on the Captain's trip so many years ago
He was looking for something more than what he had.

He said : 'I want to see his face, I want to touch his hand'
'I want to see his face and then I'll know that he's the man'
'And then I'll know that he's the man'.

We missed him once at Betelgeuse, then again at Proxima Centauri
He had 2,000 years head start but the Captain would not yield
Then he would stop that far morning star just a century gone.

He said : 'I want to see his face, I want to touch his hand'
'I want to see his face and then I'll know that he's the man'
'And then I'll know that he's the man'.

The years they passed us by but we got near him closer by the hour
On a hazy planet on the edge of space, we landed one more time
They said he'd gone away just half a day before we came.

He said : 'I want to see his face, I want to touch his hand'
'I want to see his face and then I'll know that he's the man'
'And then I'll know that he's the man'.

We left Earth when I was a boy, now I was a man approaching thirty
The Captain went up searching still but me I stayed behind
Then they brought me near, they said : 'He's here, he waits inside'.

He said : 'I want to see his face, I want to touch his hand'
'I want to see his face and then I'll know that he's the man'
'And then I'll know that he's the man'.

'I want to see his face, I want to touch his hand'

'For in a few hours more we shall be slumbering in the deep'
'For a pirate ship is coming down upon the western sea'
'To rob us of our property going to Amerikay'.

'Your gold and precious loading, this moment I demand'
'Your gold and precious cargo, resign to me this day'
'Or not a soul you'll ever bring unto Amerikay'.

The battle it commenced, brave boys, and blood in streams did flow
While undaunted did our passengers, the pirate overthrow

While the captain and his passengers the pirate did overthrow.

The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
Around the south side 
So cold that we cried

Were we ever colder on that day, a million miles away
It seemed from all of eternity

Move forward was my friend's only cry
In deeper to somewhere we could lie
And rest for the day 
With cold in the way

Were we ever colder on that day, a million miles away
It seemed from all of eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
A snow storm, a stimulating voice
Of warmth of the sky 
Of warmth when you die

Were we ever warmer on that day, a million miles away

The river can disregard the cost
And melt in the sky

'Pile stone on stone'

To see if he could come back holdin'
Twenty keys of gold

Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed
And it isn't any better if you haven't any weed
Henry's driving hard and straight
On twisty mountain roads
There's fifty people waiting back
At home for Henry's load

And now he's rollin' down the mountain
Going fast, fast, fast
And if he blows it this one's gonna be his last
Run to Acapulco to turn the golden keys
Henry keep the brakes on for this corner if you please

Henry got to Mexico and turned his truck around
He's talking with the man who has it
Growing from the ground
Henry tasted, he got wasted, couldn't even see
How he's gonna drive like that is not too clear to me

Bullfight brings the tourists and
Their money flowing down
The border guards are much too busy
There at five o' clock
Henry's truckin' right on through,
He hardly even stopped

Lifted the shadow from across my way
She touched my heart with the sweet song she was singing
Brought back the sun into my days

I'm a witness to the wonder of her ways
Oooh she's my lady
The solitary reason for my days

And sometimes when my burdens just seem too overbearing
The girl turns my tears with a single sigh
She taught me loving
And through love we both learned sharing
Right now she's every, every reason why

Yes, girl, you're a Jupiter's child

Back to where you came

Take another name
I can tell by you, it must be true

They don't embrace our own disgrace
Somebody, help me off this place

You never really quite belonged
Like a pearl among the swine
You tried to live the way we do
Hoping you would learn in time
But, mankind, with all it's virtue
Will soon make you lose your smile
On this earth, with all it's madness
Heaven help a Jupiter's child

Wish I knew the way back

89,Steve Goodman,City of New Orleans,TRDKHJB128F92FE258,1971,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America, how are you
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets made of steel
And mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America, how are you
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night America, how are you
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done"

And the sound we make together
Is the music to the story in your eyes

I realize

Listen to the tide slowly turning
Wash all our heartaches away
We're part of the fire that is burning
And from the ashes we can build another day

But I'm frightened for your children
That the life that we are living is in vain
And the sunshine we've been waiting for
Will turn to rain

That I think you've got it wrong
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood
Like an outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said what's he gonna turn out like
And someone else said never mind
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old
As all the cats I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit
Of shiny white or was it cream
I shook and shivered danced and quivered
And stood on a mountain top

No one came from miles around and said
Man your music is really hot

Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak
My throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place
As they poured on the scorn
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said, ""My boy, we'll have some crazy scenes""
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
He must've been the king of queens
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor
And there's another one for singers
It's die young and live much longer
Spend your money and sit and wonder

No one came for miles around
And said man your music is really funky

I believe that I must tell the truth
And say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth
Could I ever be a star?
Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
Everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit?
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye
The money's good and the time you have
Fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And you wonder what you did it for

No one came from miles around
And said man who's he?"

'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied

All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play
Then this young man arose and gathered his clothes
And said, ""Fare ye well, I am away""

That's not the promise you gave to me
When first you lay on my breast
You made me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west

Go home, go home to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill
And think upon your own misfortune
That you brought with your wanton will

There's not one girl in this whole town
As easily led as I
When the sky does fall and the seas run dry
Why it's then you'll marry I"

His talons dared to grasp you from my reach
Once again you clutch me to your warming breast

There I beheld a most love lie fair.

Three short steps, I stepped up to her
Not knowing her as she passed me by
I stepped up to her, thinking for to view her
She appeared to be like some virtuous bride.

I says : 'Fair maid, where are you going ?'
'And what's the occasion of all your brief ?'
'I will make you as happy as any lady'
'If you will grant to me one small relief'.

'Stand off, stand off, you're a false deceiver'
'You are a false deceitful man, I know'
Tis you that has caused my poor heart to wander'
'And in your comfort lies no refrain'.

So I'll go down to some lonesome valley
Where no man on earth shall there me find
Where the pretty little small birds do change their voices
And every moment blows blusterous wind.

So come all young men who go a-sailing
Pray pay attention to what I say

Said, get ready for the land rush, it's headed right your way.
Look what you're paying, to live on your land,
And most folks don't even have some, but I don't understand.


CHORUS
Spread the news across the land, and just do the best you can,
All we've got is just the land; Take a stand, save the land.


Sometimes I sit here thinking, but all the answers just don't appear.
I'm calling to my brothers and sisters, let's get together and kill this fear.
There ain't really gonna' be much to it. We can control the thing if we try.
With just a little more understanding, the whole world will get by.

Ever since i left my way
Still I like to be beside you
So, tell me, can I stay? Beside you

I want you so much
I want your smile
When you smile at me in the morning
And it's been so long since I felt at home in your love

Was it time I, once came running
Down the streets we used to melt
That was when I still had something
Special love for me to give, unto you

See your smile
Laughing, look at me
When you held me tight in the morning
And it's been so long since I felt at home in your love"
102,Carole King,Tapestry,TRSNRFY128F426A6B4,1971,"My life has been a tapestry
Of rich and royal hue;
An everlasting vision
Of the ever-changing view;
A wond'rous woven magic
In bits of blue and gold;
A tapestry to feel and see;
Impossible to hold.

Once amid the soft silver
Sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune;
A drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth
Around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors;
Yellow, green, on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty
As if he didn't know
Just what he was there for
Or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something
Golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down emp-ty.

Soon within my tapestry,
Along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock
And turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen
Into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer,
Though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow,
There suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly
Beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness
I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling;
He's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back."

They ridicule my wild ambitions
They say, ""settle down son, live decently,
Or you'll rot in jail before your 23!""
They don't know their stuck in the past
Can't stop me now 'cause I'm movin' too fast

Presidents, priests and old ladies too
They'll swear on the Bible
what's best for you
Atom bombs, Vietnam, missiles on the moon
And they wonder why their kids are shootin'
drugs so soon
Young men fightin' for democracy
And sacrificed for mediocrity

I can't stay in one place for too long a time
I get stone bored, I go outta my mind
I'm here and I'm there and doncha know I'm free
Gotta keep movin' baby, you and me

People wakin' up, but they've just begun
To realize what needs to be done
But as for me I keep movin' on
The future's now, yesterday is gone
I never let nobody tell me what to do
And no matter what I'm gonna see things through"

And even though her Pa was poor he always kept within the law and so did she, so did she

Because there's no shame in workin' in the rain
He's using every day to shape his daughter's character
For someone's son to marry her

On the day her Momma died he promised to protect the pride of family, family
And as he left the hospital he vowed if it was possible they'd both be free, both be free

Then came to court her, Clancy Clearwater
Rich gifts he bought her from them big stores
And her old man fancied that she's wed Clancy
A dude ranch owner from Arizona
A real fine dancer, slicked up romancer
He got this answer from his fair Nancy
No no no, I won't go, No no no, I won't go

Clancy came complaingin to the farmer did his brain in, couldn't understand, understand
Rich and pretty looking she'd not even do the cooking if she gave her hand, gave her hand

The feeling's no longer there

And it's more than I can bear

Than having you here in body only

Still smile when you walk in?
Did you ever read the letters that I wrote?
And I've been on the road since Christmas
But it don't seem so long
Outside of that there isn't much to say.
I cut down on my drinkin'
And I wrote another song
I wish you wouldn't look at me that way
Remember all the mornings
That we walked around the park
The nights we babysat for Billy's kids
And all the times we used to talk
Of having one ourselves
I don't remember why we never did
Do your neighbors still complain a bit
When the music gets too loud?
Does your old cat still sleep up on the bed?
Do you still walk around
as if your head was in the clouds?
Have you heard a single thing I've said?
And it's a two day drive to New York
I guess I'd better go
Did you notice that the weather's gettin' cold?
And it's a long time since I saw you last

And your towers are turning

And try to get down to the sea somehow

Gotta get down to the sea somehow

Every woman child and man

Now everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow

It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you gliding in one place
Like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang onto that gospel cloud
When my life is over
Gonna stand for the father
But the sisters of the sun
Are gonna rock me on the water now

Rock me on the water

Maybe I'll remember how

All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, Fare thee well today.

That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.

Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will.

There's not one girl in this whole town
As easily led as I,
And when the sky does fall and the seas will run dry,
Why, it's then you'll marry I."

But many people have often tried to catch and take me home
They never caught me!

Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal
All want me for their own.

The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go

So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon.
The fish ran away with the moon
The fish ran away with the moon."

And she's so sunny is the girl you met today
Will she make it? Can she take it?
Like to try love, such a shy love

Ragged backstreet, leanin' on the wall
She weaves a story of her life before it all
Did she give love? Could she feel love?
Did she find love? Was it real love?

Where's your smile today? Did she let you down?
Try to see she didn't mean to make you feel so sad

Ragged backstreet, sittin' on a wall
She tells of men that she knew before it all
When she made love she tried to find love
When she gives love she will find love

Who says he hasn't any fears
He has a brother
Who's been sailing here for years

But if I have this friend for long
He'll hear this sad confusing song
And look away from all he thinks he knows
And wonder where it goes

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who says he's shedding no more tears
Got him a woman
Who will love him through the years

If I've ever known his dreams
Things are all the way they seem
He'll walk away from all his promises
And laugh about betrayal

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who has not been here very long
He goes 'round and 'round
And spins you out a song

He says his memory's to blame
When nothing ever sounds the same
Here, ""I'm going inside the words"", he said
And crawl back out the hole

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found a friend
Who says he cannot sleep at night
He lies awake
And balls his fists to beat the fright

He says it's hard to get ahead
And things are better done than said
It's a lonesome situation here
Hard and long and gone

Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn his head and look away
Alone, alone

And I found some friends
Who turn their heads and look away
(Man, what's wrong with you)
With all their reasons
Sounding good for things they say

If I have these friends for long
I'd get so lost inside this song
I'd get away from what I'm leaning on
Go on and on and on

Turn my head and look away
Alone
Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone

Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone
Turn my head and look away
Alone, alone"

And how right your arms feel around me.
But I rehearsed those words just late last night
When I was thinking about how right tonight might be.

Said ""Son, its all part of your job""

That I would kick if I was given the chance

I was whipped in the barn until dawn

Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm

Get up early, walk, and kick a stone along

I walked and did some window shopping
And met someone I used to know

The years had been kind to her beauty
When I first saw her my heart jumped
Tonight if I seem disenchanted
I took a memory to lunch

We sat and talked about the old days
With misty teardrops in our eyes


And reconfirmed an old suspicion
The past grows old but never dies

The charm that draws two hearts together
By four o' clock was just too much
The days and years we had between us
Were down to just two coffee cups

The afternoon kept wearing on

There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain."

So, let's not hang our heads,
The light will show through yet.

Yeahh...

Now listen baby, and listen well,
I've got only one thing to tell.
Don't you worry about people telling lies,
They're only catching flies.

Yeahhh..

A whole lotta people talking, 
Trying to make sense. 
Seems everybody's living on a barbed wire fence,
Whole lotta people too proud to call,
'Cause it won't get no,
'Cause it won't get no, 
'Cause it won't get no,
Help at all,
Help at all."

Cos it's me the rain my warm dark pain
Alone at ease and nowhere at all

It seems you're here so it must be true

Not to let the moment pass
Turning around in love with you
Oh I know you loved me too
And it's always been this way

Here sitting in my wet cafe

Seem to have a tale to tell

But they call him the Black Satin Kid

Black Satin Kid, where you gonna run to
Black Satin Kid
Double kickin' Black Satin Kid
Who you gonna drum to
Black Satin Kid
Shoulder shakin', heart breakin' 
Black Satin Kid

All he ever carried was some funk-butt drums
And they cost him every dime he had
But he saved the show
Left 'em screamin' for more
when the band was walkin' out bad

Black Satin Kid.....

Well you can talk about your East Coast/West Coast jazz
and you Nashville country western soul
They gonna talk about a kid from San Antone
in the history book of Rock 'n Roll"

He was workin' his way back home now
Over many a ragged mile
When he finally crossed the river
And his father saw him near
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear

I listened to what the Good Book said
And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
And people tryin' to be free
Now we got new names and faces
This time around
Gospel changes, Lord
Still goin' down

Jesus--He did not doubt His gift
Though He knew that He had not long to live
He took care of the business,
Teaching us how to fly
Then He bowed His head
And laid down to die

And it made good sense to me
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'
And people tryin' to be free

Still goin' down

Jerusalem I see is standing high
But if you lose your salvation
There'll be no tears left to cry
Now some men worship a golden calf
While others are bought and sold
And if we live like that,
Brother we pay the toll

Beat the drum slowly and play the pipes only
Play up the dead march as we go along
And bring me to Tipperary and lay me down easy

Solitary sadness comes over me

And after the school was over
And I moved to the other side
I found another country 
But I never lost my pride

Military madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild

Military madness is killing our country
So much sadness between you and me"

Memory lane's a dead end street
Your presence tence is reminiscent
I can't rehash it, I won't repeat

Your not so sure about tomorrow
You try to beg and steal and borrow
Yesterday sweet parting sorrow
You hold it over my head like a rusty aks

The good old days are good and gone now
That's why they are good, because they are gone
But our conversation turns the cow tow
We kiss the pasts ass all night long

Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colours, 
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.
He's gone.

When the wars of our nation did beckon,
A man barely twenty did answer the calling.
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation,
He's gone,
But Eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done.

And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry.
And deep in the trench he waited for hours,
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die.

But the silence of night was shattered by fire
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air.
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered.
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there.

He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear.
""They can't let me die! They can't let me die here!
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth.
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave.""

Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colours,
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone.

To taste such traditional fare
And I'm not really a bit eater

It was Christmas day in North Africa
But Nigeria had forgotten the date
Sanctioned myrrh from all mankind
They delivered the presents of hate
They delivered the presents of hate

It was the day after Christmas Khe Sanh
And relatives out in the crowd
Shared a final family reunion
Boxing the dead in white shrouds
Boxing the dead in white shrouds

So I settled for steak pie and onions
Supplemented with Shreddies and beer
Not the gourmets delight, I admit it
But what did they eat over there?

""This steaks really good.""
""Any skins down down there?""

The people, they all jeered at him and circled him all 'round
And an old man pulled a gun from his pants and laughed and shot him down.

They called for gas, they pulled out knives, what they did, I will not say
Then the old man turned to me, said : 'We don't like your kind' - and I knew that I was saved."

Sweetly serenely she showed me her gun

I sat down to the matters at hand 
Trying to find a way to beat the heat 
Outside my window was a bunch of tipsy gypsys 
Dancin' up and down the street 
The lovely senorita took me by my hand 
She said, ""Oh, baby won't you be my man"" 
I'll be yours and you'll be mine 
Baby let's have a good time.

In search of some game if the weather proved fair
To see could I get a shot at the bonny black hare

And her skin was as fair as the lily that blows
I says ""My fair maiden, why ramble you so?
Can you tell me where the bonny black hare do go?""

Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was ""No
But it's under me apron they say it do go
And if you'll not deceive me I vow and declare
We'll both go together to hunt the bonny black hare""

Well, I laid this girl down with her face to the skies
And I took out my ramrod and my bullets likewise
I says ""Lock your legs round me and dig in with your heels
For the closer we get, oh, the better it feels""

The birds they were singing in the bushes and trees
And the song that they sang was ""Oh, she's easy to please""
I felt her heart quiver and I knew what I'd done
Says I ""Have you had enough of my old sporting gun?""

Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was ""Nay
It's not often young sportsmen like you come this way
And if your powder is willing and your bullets play fair
Why don't you keep firing at the bonny black hare?""

My ramrod is limp and I cannot fire on

There's no one to tell us what we're living for

And though I try to be a good man
I just know that I'll be losing very soon
And there are times and there are motions
When I do believe I'm going out of tune, oh

Now I've been around a long, long while
Looking for sun to make me smile
But still multiply their daily bread
They're thinking there lies good times ahead
It must be a mighty funny way to feel

I keep finding out there's nowhere to begin
And so I think I'll go on singing
And in time I hope that we can all join in, oh"

Chasing mirrors through a haze

Now that you know it's nowhere
What's to stop you coming home
All you got to do is go there
Then you'll really realize what's going down

You went to a strange land searching
For a truth you felt was wrong
That's when the heartaches started
Though you're where you want to be, you're not where you belong

As I wander to and fro,
Sad would be your day.

My life is mine and the light did shine
Till the guns they did go through me,
So now I shall never fall.
Ideals of peace are gold which fools have found
Upon the plains of war.
I shall destroy them all.

Put away your guns of steel,
Death comes too soon for all.
Your Master He may need you soon,
And you must heed His call. 
I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play,
So I will teach your sons.
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days,
Why, then they will die young.

And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days,

Condemn me not,
For always will I play the game of war,
In moonshine or in sun.
And if any cross the path I choose to tread,
Their chances they are poor.
My name is John The Gun.

Put away your guns of steel,
Death comes too soon for all.

Like a road map of New York city

Proud Mary keeps on burning.

Two friends, travelers with weary feet
Brother, let us leave the road a while
Time now, drink and dance away the miles
See what welcome yonder tavern smiles
Come with me, and now let us drink together
Stay with me, I feel like I could dance forever

Brother, do not tarry, come away
This house cursed is for those who stay
Things are not what they appear to be
If now you desire it, look and see
Fortune ruins those who turn the key
Come with me, and let us go on our way together
Stay with me, or go to the devil and dance forever

Ten years now have passed that fateful day
One friend, long since went his weary way
One friend, what task fortune's hand has set
Dry bones, sightless, still he dances yet
Pounding feet from which no blood is let
Come with me, and let us go on our way together
Stay with me, or go to the devil and dance forever"

A new heart to break
And leave feeling blue
For you're a handsome guy
Girls just can't pass you by
But I can, my friend
I'm the exception to the rule
I know you think I'm just acting the part
Of the girl with the cold, cold heart
And it won't take long
For you to capture me
With your innocent but meaningful plea
But you won't capture me
I'm the exception to the rule
You tell me
Darling that's where you're wrong
That your love for me is oh so strong
That you will soon, very soon
Make me give in
I know that nine girls out of every ten
Wants you to be their man
But there I am again
That one in ten
So it's useless
For you to try and change me
Because I won't give in, my friend
You could fool all the girls
With your lies
About you being so sweet and kind
But oh no, not me
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up
I'm the one you can't fool
I'm the one
I'm the exception to the rule
Give it up
I'm the one you can't fool

We were told that the city could only bring us harm
""how far is the city? "" somebody said, and ""oh, that's a great big town.""
Barbara said, ""why, it's a million miles,"" and the story got around

(chorus)
It's a million miles to the city
From the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city
And someday we all wanna go

There was a town nearby, but a town is a town, and a city...well, that's
Something else


Our daddy had been to a city but he never was much help
""why the buildings are taller than oak trees."" ah, but we knew better than that
Ain't nobody could climb that high, the cities were wide and flat

(chorus)

Well now time has passed and we have grown and travelled far and wide
The cities have changed the kids we were, we see it in each others eyes
But I'd love to go back to those hills again, to the boy I used to be
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills were part of the land like me

And his momma lived her short life having kids and baling hay
He had fifteen years and he ached inside to wander 
So he jumped a freight at Waycross and wound up in LA.

The cold nights had no pity on that Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, and then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitution's child, born of an LA. street called ""Shame""

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy 
Laughter found their mornings brought a meaning to his life
And the night before she left sleep came and left thatWaycross, country boy 
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor
And in place of his Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who growled, ""Your Georgia neck is red but Sonny you're still green""

He turned twenty-one in a grey rock federal prison 
The old judge had no mercy on that Waycross, Georgia boy
Staring at those four grey walls, in silence he would listen
To the midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lying 'neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried ""Have you seen Mabel Joy!""
Stunned and shaken someone said ""Son, she don't live here no more
She left this house four years today, they say she's looking for ... 
Some Georgia farm boy"

Bootlegging boozer on the West Side

She was a long cool woman in a black dress
With a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess

I saw her head out to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
Hon', I'm telling you she knows where it's at""

And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

And a-she was a-holding my right

And the old masters wind of the waves
Sped forth for the free men and slaves
Whispers of secrets it saves
And about whom they are

And the workings of sunshine and rain
And the visions they paint that remain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a spanish guitar

The beggar whom sits in the street
On his miserable throne of defeat
Envisions no wealth there to meet
Thinking nowhere is far

And the laughter of children employed
By the fantasies not yet destroyed
By the dogmas of those they avoid
Knowing not what they are

And the right and the wrong and insane
And the answers they cannot explain
Pulsate from my soul through my brain
In a spanish guitar

To play on a spanish guitar
With the sun shining down where you are
Skipping and singing a bar
From the music around

Just to laugh through the columns of trees
To soar like a seagull in breeze
To stand in the rain if you please
Or to never be found"

di partire solo

Ah, quando s'alza il vento
Ah, quando s'alza il vento
No, più fermare non si può
dove vado non lo so
quanto male ti farò
non ti svegliare mai"
284,Gil Scott-Heron,Home is Where the Hatred Is,TRZNDKV128F428C20B,1971,"A junkie walking through the twilight, I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is, home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again

Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks try to heal my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again

Stand as far away from me as you can and yes ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads, close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying, kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it
God, but did you ever try?
To turn your sick soul inside out so that the world
So that the world can watch you die
Watch you die

Home is where I live inside my white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks try to heal my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
Yes it might not be such a bad idea if I never
It might not be such a bad idea, seems I need to get out of here
It might not be such a bad idea, seems I need to get out of here
It might not be such a bad idea
It might not be such a bad idea
It might not be such a bad idea
If I never, never, never, never
Never went home again"
285,Tom T. Hall,The Little Lady Preacher,TRAFIKI128EF34DE53,1971,"Oh, the little lady preacher from the limestone church
I'll never forget her, I guess
She preached each sunday mornin' on the local radio
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress

She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault
But I will admit she knew the Bible well
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell

She had a guitar picker by the name of luther short
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin
She would turn and smile at luther when the program would commence
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn

I was pickin' for her too with what we call the doghouse bass
I clung to every word that passed her lips
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips


The lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached
But ol' luther took her home each sunday morn'
Lookin' back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born

Sometimes ol' luther showed up at the studio half-tight
And smokin' was a thing he liked to do
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me
I told her in a way that I'd been prayin' for her too

One sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone
Said she and brother luther had a call
I can see me standin' in that studio that day
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all

I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room
I know ol' luther short and he's a hard ol' boy to change
And I've often sat and wondered who it was converted whom"
286,Julien Clerc,Rolo Le Baroudeur,TRBHRLX128F93466B9,1971,"Rolo le Baroudeur
 A comme une guerre de retard
 Il arracherait des pleurs
 Même à un vieux cigare
 
En lui parlant de Cuba
 Et des plages lointaines
 Des grands champs de tabacs
 De la Plaine Cubaine
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 N'a pas les mots de son âge
 Il a les mots du coeur
 Des idiots de village
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 A comme un rêve de retard
 Il vous ferait rêver
 Les pavés des boulevards
 
En leur parlant de Blois
 De Chartres, de Notre Dame
 Et des granits dressés
 Au flancs de la Bretagne
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 N'a pas les mots de son âge
 Il a les mots du coeur
 Des idiots de village
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 A comme le teint blafard
 En pensant aux chaleurs
 Du désert des Tartares
 
Il a le temps en feu
 Au milieu de l'hiver
 Et dans ses deux mains nouées
 On entendrait la mer
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 N'a pas les mots de son âge
 Il a les mots du coeur
 Des idiots de village
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 Connaît tous les pays
 Il les connaît par coeur
 Il les connaît à vie
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 A comme une autre vie
 Enfouie au fond du coeur
 Quand il parle, il l'oublie
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 N'a pas les mots de son âge
 Il a les mots du coeur
 Des idiots de village
 
Rolo le Baroudeur
 A les rêves percés
 Et une plaie au coeur
 Qu'il voudrait oublier
 La, la, la...
 Qu'il voudrait oublier
 La, la, la...
 La, la, la...
 La, la, la..."
287,May Blitz,High Beech,TRFUPGU128F934BF3D,1971,"And the morning comes for another time
As the night slips away for a new day to shine
The feeling of life wakens all around
To the playing guitar with sight and sound
Watching the sun rise
Lifted upon the air
Shadows bring to life
And I know that today is the beginning of the rest of our lives

And in the afternoon the feeling is there
From the warmth that rubs us the air
But the sun is at its highest place
Enjoying the freshness of the inner space
Together we should be
Nature and man in harmony
Shadows disappear
And I know that today is the beginning of the rest of our lives

Together we should be
Nature and man in harmony"
288,Kenny Rogers & The First Edition,Tell It All Brother,TROFMOV128F421348C,1971,"Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all.

How much you're holding back on me
When you say you're giving all?
And in the dungeons of your mind
Who you got chained to the wall?

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all.

Did you plant your feet on higher ground
To avoid life's mud and stone?
Did you ever kick a good man
When he was down, just to make yourself feel strong?

Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters
Tell it all. 

Tomorrow just might be too late
Now is the time
To get your jumbled mind straight
And seek a new design

Did you ever walk before a crippled man
Pretending you were lame?
And what made you think one feeble hymn to God
Was gonna make him call your name?

Tell it all brother and sisters
Tell, Tell it all
Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all brothers and sisters, tell
Tell it all brother, before we fall
Tell it all..."
289,Atomic Rooster,Nobody Else,TRQMPXL12903CF2B9B,1971,"Crane

My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

My whole world is so alone
My whole world is so alone
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

My whole world is falling down
My whole world is fallen down
Couldn't see you're only me, nobody else to blame
My whole world is gone away

Gone away, gone away, gone away"
290,Don McLean,Vincent,TRWRXTH128F145712E,1971,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"
291,Steppenwolf,For Ladies Only,TRRAQKE128F1459BBC,1971,"What you say to drive that girl away 
When she's the one and only? 
Who's the one that you been leanin' on 
Ev'ry time that you were down and lonely?
How many times did you say to yourself that woman is the devil's tool?
Somehow you knew that you blew it again and didn't wanna look like a ravin fool
But when you need affection 
You go to her with a smilin' face
But now she's got a strange reaction

For ladies only
Tired of talkin' 'till somebody hears
For ladies only 
Half the world has been built upon their tears

If you've been contemplatin' just what you're doin' wrong 
Then you will be a witness to the rumble goin' on
You fight it hard to tell apart the truth from the jive
They've got a right to say it wrong if freedom's to survive
Now if you don't believe your own reflection
Just take a look at all your smooth talkin' friends
I'm sure you'll make the right connection

For ladies only
Too much waiting for too many years
For ladies only 
Half the world has been built upon their tears

I'll give you my donation to help the cause along
I'll make my contribution 'till the fight has been won
But when my bedroom closes one thing remains
Man, woman, hog or dog, I'm callin' the plays 
And if you find the need to raise objections
Don't talk to me 'bout your wasted time
You know you made your own selections

For ladies only
Too much waiting for too many years
For ladies only 
Half the world has been built on their tears
For ladies only
Tired of talkin' 'till somebody hears
For ladies only 
Half the world has been built on their tears
