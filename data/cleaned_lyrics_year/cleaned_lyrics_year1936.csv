0,Big Bill Broonzy,Good Liquor Gonna Carry Me Down,TRBOGEP12903CF3814,1936,"Lord, I know a little girl 
'Bout sixteen years old 
She says, ""Bill, stop drinkin' 
I will satisfy your soul 

But I just keep on-a drinkin' 
Yeah, I keep on drinkin' 
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin' 
Till good liquor carry me down 

Now, my woman told me 
About fifteen years ago 
""Bill, you gonna drink one of these mornings 
And you'll never drink no more 

But I just keep on-a drinkin' 
Yeah, I keep on drinkin' 
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin' 
Till good liquor carry me down 

Yes, I went to the doctor 
With my head in my hands 
The doctor said, ""Big Bill, I think 
I'll have to give you monkey glands"" 

But I just keep on-a drinkin' 
Yeah, I keep on drinkin' 
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin' 
Till good liquor carry me down 

Lord, my woman told me to stop drinkin' 
And come on home 
Say, ""If you don't big bill, some other man 
Gonna carry your business home"" 

But I just keep on-a drinkin' 
Yeah, I keep on drinkin' 
Yeah, I just keep on drinkin' 
Till good liquor carry me down"
1,Big Joe Williams,Worried Man blues,TRRYPIF128F426F65A,1936,"I am a worried man, worried all day long
I am a worried man, I'm worried all day long
Yes, that woman I'm lovin', boys, she done done me wrong

Lord, I rambled and I wandered, cried the whole day long
Lord, I rambled and I wandered, cried the whole day long
Don't a man feel worried when you find your dough-roller gone?

Lord, I went home last night, baby, peeped out my window blinds
Lord, I went home last night, I peeped out my window blinds
Said, my good gal done quit me, boys, I'm down in my mind

I wanted to tell you women, how you keep your man at home
Wanted to tell you women, how you keep your man at home
You love him soon there in the mornin', start him rollin' in your arms

I am a worried man, he worries all night long
Play it for Papa Joe!
I am a worried man, he worries all night long
I'm gwonna leave here in the mornin', feel like my time ain't long

Malvina, don't get worried, when your good man done leave this
Malvina, don't get worried, when your good man done leave this town
Lord, I woke up this mornin', feelin' down in my mind"
2,Big Joe Williams,Stack O' Dollars,TRXGOZK128F427DEB2,1936,"That stack of dollars, the stack of dollars, high as I am tall, well, sugar
Well, stack of dollars, high as I am tall
If you be my woman, you can have them all

Well, stack of dollars, stack of dollars, bring my babe back home, well, sugar
The stack of dollars bring my babe back home
Lord, went away this mornin', Lord, but she couldn't stay long

The wind gonna rise and, the wind gonna rise and blow my blues away, aw, sugar
The wind gon' rise and, and blow my blues away

Oh, stack of dollars, Oh, stack of dollars, gonna bring my baby back home, oh, sugar
Well, stack of dollars , bring my baby back home
If I had a stack of dollars, Lord, she would not do me wrong

I got up this mornin', I got up this mornin', I looked 'way down the road, oh, sugar
I got up this mornin', I thought I'd look 'way down the road
Yes, my good gal, she done quit me, I hate to see this last one go

It take a brownskin woman satisfy my wicked soul

Well, stack of dollars, well, stack of dollars, take me where I'm gwine, oh, sugar
Well, stack of dollars take me where I'm goin'
And the woman I'm lovin', she don't pay me no mind"
3,Billie Holiday,Summertime,TRCOJBT128F9306EC6,1936,"Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin
And the cotton is high
Oh your daddy's rich
And your ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornin's
You're goin' to rise up singin'
Yes you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But til' that mornin' 
Theres nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy
Standin' by

Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Oh your daddy's rich 
And you ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry"
4,Billie Holiday,Billie's Blues,TRUWTCO128F931FCB5,1936,"Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue

My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go

Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs"
5,Bing Crosby,Pennies From Heaven,TRBTWLV128F92D85DD,1936,"A long time ago
A million years BC
The best things in life
Were absolutely free.
But no one appreciated 
A sky that was always blue.
And no one congratulated
A moon that was always new.
So it was planned that they would vanish now and them
And you must pay before you get them back again.
That's what storms were made for
And you shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains
Pennies from heaven.
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven.
You'll find yor fortune falling
All over town.
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down.
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers.
If you want the things you love 
You must have showers.
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree.
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me."
6,Fred Astaire,The Way You Look Tonight,TRJMLKX12903CAA174,1936,"Someday,
When I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look, tonight

Oh but you're lovely
With you  smile so warm
And your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you  look, tonight

With each word you tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely,
Never never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it
'Cause I love, you
Just the way you look, tonight
Just the way you look, tonight"
7,Noel Coward,We Were Dancing,TRNZMKP12903C9579A,1936,"[spoken:] I only know that when we were dancing an enchantment swept over me. An enchantment that I've never known before and shall never know again.  Oh, its obvious that to you my behavior must seem cheap, childish, idiotic, anything you like—but it's true this magic that's happened—so true that all ordinary ways of behavior look shabby and unreal beside it.  My heart's thumping, I'm trembling like a fool, even now when I'm trying so hard, so desperately hard to explain to you calmly and reasonably, I daren't look at you.  If I did my eyes would brim over with these foolish tears and I should cry like a child.

If you can
Imagine my embarrassment when you politely asked me to explain,
Man to man,
I cannot help but feel conventional apologies are all in vain.
You must see,
We've stepped into a dream that's set us free.
Don't think we've planned it,
Please, understand it.

We were dancing,
And the gods must have found it entrancing
For they smiled
On a moment undefiled
By the care and woe that mortals know.
We were dancin,g
And the music and lights were enhancing
Our desire,
When the world caught on fire
She and I were dancing.

Love lay in wait for us,
Twisted our fate for us,
No one warned us
Reason scorned us,
Time stood still
In that first sweet thrill.
Destiny knew of us,
Guided the two of us,
How could we 
Refuse to see
That wrong seemed right
On that lyrical enchanted night.
Logic supplies no laws for it,
Only one thing calls for it.

We were dancing,
And the gods must have found it entrancing
For they smiled
On a moment undefiled
By the care and woe that mortals know.
We were dancing,
And the music and lights were enhancing
Our desire,
When the world caught on fire
She and I were dancing."
8,Red Foley,Old Shep,TRWVMJQ128F4249BCE,1936,"When I was a lad and Old Shep was a pup
O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day, the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was tremblin', I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried, so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie, he knew he was goin' to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
""We're partin' but you understand""

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a Heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home"

Rainin' on the ocean
Stormin' on the sea
Rainin' on the ocean
And it's stormin' on the sea
Blues in that shower
Is showering down on me

Come back, baby
Won't be bad, no more
Come back baby, woo-ooo
Won't be bad no more
I'll sing on my knees
An I'll follow anywhere you go

(piano and guitar)

Mean ol' fireman, good old engineer
Mean old fireman, woo-ooo, good old engineer
They took my baby 'way
And left me standin' here.

10,Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,I'm Gettin' Sentimental Over You,TRWHLDH128F4284B31,1936,"Never thought I'd fall but now I hear love call
I'm getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through
I'm getting sentimental over you

I thought I was happy, I could live without love
Now I must admit love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle
Be gentle with me because I'm sentimental over you"
