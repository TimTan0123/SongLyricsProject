0,"Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup",Look On Yonder Wall,TRLTEAF128F42640B1,1960,"Darling, look on yonder's wall
Hand me down my walking cane
Yes, look on yonder's wall
Hand me down my walking cane
I got to find me another woman
Baby, yonder comes your man
Darling, I know your man he went to war
I believe he fared mighty tough
Don't know how many men he killed
But I believe he killed enough

Ah do I love you, baby
And I love you for myself
Fooling around now with you, babe
I can't get nobody else

Yes, now that's all right
All right for you
That's all right, baby
Any way you do"
1,Ben E. King,Spanish Harlem,TRRGETS12903D03916,1960,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

I'm going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows in my garden

(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
La la la, la la la, la la la la
(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
La la la, la la la, la la la la
(There is a rose in Spanish Harlem)"

Without you I could not live

I read the latest news
No buttons on my shoes
Baby, I'm confused about you
You've got me in a spin and
What a spin I'm in
Cause I don't know enough about you

Jack-of-all-trades, master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'd be good for me
If you'd only play my game

You know I went to school and
I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
You've got me in a spin and
What a spin I'm in
Cause I don't know enough about you

I know a bit about biology
A little more about psychology
I'm a little gem in geology

these go with learning the game 

When you love her and she doesn't love you 
you're only learning the game 

When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love

Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue 
that's when you're learning the game"

18,Chuck Berry,Too Pooped To Pop,TRHPFKN128F4271255,1960,"Casey is an old man who wants to be a teen
He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha king
He cha-chas when the band is playin' rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold. 

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Chicks told Casey, You better move man,
This is only a one night stand
Casey wasn't in time but he was dancin' awhile
Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style. 

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips gettin' weaker when he tries to do the stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray.

Casey finally learned to do the hoochie koo
This might have been fine back in '22
Now, I'm gonna give you fellows just a little tip
If you wanna keep your girl you'd better get hip
Or, you'll be too pooped to pop, too old a soul
You hips are gettin' weaker when you'll try to do the stroll
And every time your feet gettin' to go in one way
Here comes a new dance you'll be left to stray."

Hmm, you know I hate to see the sun
Hurry to the west
'Cos I know my whole life
Will be in a solid mess

I got to find my baby
I declare, I wouldn't lie
I ain't had no real good loving

Cochise met up with Geronimo’s tribe

Sent my lady downtown to shop

She evidently didn’t know when to stop

With a mink stole here and a chinchilla there
A here fur, there fur, fur where I don’t know
Sent my lady downtown to shop

I bet all I had on a hearsay sure shot

A home bill, gas bill, all but a dollar bill

She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon
Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to her face"

Sweet dreams of you..."

I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again"

Lonely is the man, who walks alone

What is this thing, mortals call love
And why can't I have one of my own
I am so lonely, so all alone

Lonely is the bird, without a tree

And climb that stairway to the stars
With Love beside us
To fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us 
As we go drifting along.

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hills?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
Settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven
To climb to heaven with you

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
Yes we're climbing
Climbing to that stairway to the stars
Stars, stars, stars
The sound of violins
Way out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us 
As we go drift drift drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal 
Over the rim of the hills?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
Settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Keep building the stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars

Falling leaves, a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

You and I and
Moonlight in Vermont"

You can't get cherry soda

And the way things are I'll bet they never will
They've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil

No tea or tomato juice
You'll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no

Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil

You date a girl and find out later 
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil

And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives 'em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil

Dunking doesn't take a lot of skill

Felt the rapture of the dawning thrilled through sunset's golden view
I've sought above the mountain peeks for valleys great and wide
But it's a little more like heaven by your side
It's a little more like heaven where you are
I have sought for happiness both near and far
But my search for love was through the day that I met you
Cause it's a little more like heaven where you are

I have watched the crystal raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds have flown away
I've adored the clinging roses round my mountain home so dear
But it's a little more like heaven when you're near
It's a little more like heaven...

I've been tempted for a moment by your lure and magic charms
Of a fickle flame and beauty while waltzin' in her arms
I cherrished mem'ries of the past of friends so kind and true

61,Hank Thompson,Squaws Along the Yukon,TRSMWBX12903D01FE9,1960,"There's a salmon-colored girl who sets my heart awhirl
Who lives along the Yukon far away
Where the Northern Lights they shine she rubs her nose to mine
She cuddles close and I can hear her say

Ooga ooga mooska which means that I love you
If you'll be my baby I'll ooga ooga mooska you
Then I take her hand in mine and set her on my knee
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

She makes her underwear from hides of grizzly bear
And bathes in ice cold water every day
Her skin I love to touch but I just can't touch it much
Because her fur lined parka's in the way
Ooga ooga mooska...
[ guitar ]
She has the Air Corps down the Sourdoughs hang around
Chechakos try to date her night and day
With a landing gear that's fine and a fuselage divine
And a smile that you can see a mile away
Ooga ooga mooska...
Carry me back to old Alaska
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me"
62,Hank Thompson,Wake Up Irene,TRKPQYU12903D031FA,1960,"For months and months and months around the country
Everybody sang Irene goodnight
But she wouldnt go to bed no matter what they said
Though everybody tried with all their might

She stayed awake while steel guitars were a going
In every honky tonk she could be seen
But she finally went to bed and covered up her head
And now theres not a thing can wake Irene

Wake up Irene, youve sleep too long
Wake up Irene, its time to move along
Wake up Irene, and pay for your bed
Wake up Irene or folks will think you're dead

Lots of guitar pickers by the dozen
Sang 'Goodnight Irene' all night and day
And even Crosby too with his bo bo bo bo be do
Tried to get Irene to hit the hay

Well I guess they finally sang her off to slumber
They must have tried a million times or more
But, oh, my aching back when she finally hit the sack man
You ought to hear that women snore

Wake up Irene, youve sleep too long
Wake up Irene, its time to move along
Wake up Irene, and pay for your bed
Wake up Irene or folks will think you're dead"
63,Hank Thompson,Breakin' The Rules,TRYLYTL128F429FB0F,1960,"Breakin' the rules every time I hug and kiss you darling
While you wear another's name
If you're breakin' the rules in any kind of game you're playing reckless
And taking chances just the same

Can it be a sin to love you like I do
And we'd just be called a pair of fools
If it's so wrong to want to be with you my darling
Then I guess I'll go on breakin' rules
[ steel - fiddle ]
Can it be a sin..."

Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul

Men lied about a little
Some of them cried about little
Some of them died about a little spoon
Everything fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me

Men lied about that
Some of them died about that
Some of them cried about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

It could be a spoonful of water
Save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of lead from my forty-five
Save you from another man

Men lied about that
Some of them cried about that
Some of them died about that
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that

That spoon, dat spoon, dat spoonful"

E gritava: a, e, i, o, u, y

E dançando fora do compasso

E gritei, não faça sujeira
O xaxado esquentou na gafieira
E Sebastiana não deu mais fracasso

That Mary Hamilton has borne a babe
To the highest Stuart of all

Oh rise, arise Mary Hamilton 
Arise and tell to me
What thou hast done with thy wee babe 
I saw and heard weep by thee

I put him in a tiny boat
And cast him out to sea
That he might sink or he might swim
But he'd never come back to me

Oh rise arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and come with me
There is a wedding in Glasgow  town
This night we'll go and see

She put not on her robes of black
Nor her robes of brown
But she put on her robes of white
To ride into Glasgow town

And as she rode into Glasgow town
The city for to see
The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife
Cried Alack and alas for thee

You need not weep for me she cried
You need not weep for me
For had I not slain my own wee babe 
This death I would not dee

Oh little did my mother think
When first she cradled me
The lands I was to travel in 
And the death I was to dee

Last night I washed the Queen's feet
And put the gold in her hair
And the only reward I find for this
The gallows to be my share

Cast off cast off my gown she cried
But let my petticoat be
And tie a napkin round my face 
The gallows I would not see

Then by them come the king himself
Looked up with a pityful eye
Come down come down Mary Hamilton
Tonight you will dine with me

Oh hold your tongue my sovereign liege
And let your folly be
For if you'd a mind to save my life
You'd never have shamed me here

Last night there were four marys 
Tonight there'll be but three
T'was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton
And Mary Carmichael and me."

And found a sweet infant was there
And before it was dark she looked in the ark
And found a sweet infant was there

And away by the waters so blue
They carried that beautiful child
To his tender mother, his sister and brother
Little Moses looked happy and smiled
And she called him her own, her beautiful son
And sent for a nurse that was near
And she called him her own, her beautiful son
And sent for a nurse that was near

And away by the sea that was red, so red
Little Moses the servant of God
Before him subsided, the seas were divided
As upwards he lifted his rod
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh's host
Were drownded in the waters and lost
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh's host
Were drownded in the waters and lost

And away on a mountain so high
The last one that he ever did see
With Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
That same day all the Jordan be free
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above"

He's been gone for seven years
Still no man shall marry me

What if he's in some battle slain
Or drownded (sic) in the deep salt sea
What if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be?

If he's in some battle slain
I will die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
I'll be true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

And the pale and the leader and eyes look so blue

I will dance, I will sing and my life shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay
And all portions of love then had all flown away

He taught me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning, no words of farewell

He taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's weary hour
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected his frail wildwood flower"

Ardió en el pecho el rencor y no se pudo aguantar

The very next evening, they'll court another,
Leave you alone to pine and sigh.

To sleep alone all of my life."

There I longed to lay my head.

Well, in my heart you are my darlin',
At my door you're welcome in,
At my gate I'll meet you my darlin',
If your love I could only win.

I'd rather be in some dark holler,
Where the sun refuse to shine,
Then to see you be another man's darlin',
And to know that you'll never be mine.

Well in the night I'm dreamin' about you,
In the day I find no rest,
Just the thought of you my darlin',
Sends aching pain all through my breast.

Come and sit beside me darlin',
Come and think on the way you done."

Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee 
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he 
He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent 
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went
 
And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares 
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs
There he kept on helping folks get well,for his heart was jus'pure gold,
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was gettin' old. 

Then one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door 
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more 
They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content 
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent 

So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull 
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full 
Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king 
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing 

'Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well 
Donatin' an old iron casket he had never been able to sell 
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style 
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile 

We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one 
Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done 
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign 
We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine 

Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint 
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint 
But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers 
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs"
89,Johnny Cash,Give my Love to Rose,TRWINCB128F936351C,1960,"I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dyin' fellow said

He said, ""They let me out of prison down in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose, please, won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tell them I said 'thanks' for waiting for me?
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
For it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister, here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now, don't forget to give my love to Rose

Give my love to Rose, please, won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose"""

It's good to have you home
I hurried thru 'cause I knew it was you
When I saw your dog, waggin' his tail
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail
You've been gone so long

She said come in stranger
I know you're weary from all your miles
Just sit right there in your easy chair
And tell me all about the places you've been
How long it'll be before you leave again
I hope it's a long, long while

She said come in stranger
Everything 'round home is fine
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back
And I missed you all the time

She said come in, stranger
Oh how I need you when you're gone
I walk the floor and I watch the door
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be
I'd give anything to have you here with me
I get so lonesome all alone

She said come in, stranger

Stay long enough, so that the one I love
Is not a stranger to me"

I said, ""Now buy a little groceries, and don't spend no more.""
But she gave ten dollars for a ten cent hat
And bought some store bought cat food for a mean eyed cat.

When I give her ten more dollars for a one way ticket
She was mad as she could be
Then I bet ten more that if she ever left
She'd come a-crawlin' back to me
When I woke up this mornin' and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton pickin' thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, ""Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone.""

When I heard a whistle blowin', and the big wheels a-turnin'
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed to town
Gonna bring her back with me.

I asked the man down at the station
if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long, blonde hair
He spit his tobacco, said, ""I'll be dad blamed......
I believe I did see her leavin' on the east bound train.""

I bought a round trip ticket on the east bound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back,
gotta buy another ticket
Gotta bring her back with me.

Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my Mother-In-Law
She said, ""I'll tell you where she is, if you act right.""
""She's workin' four to twelve at Trucker's World tonight.""

When I walked in she saw me, and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her goin' home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips
And now we're curled up on the sofa, me and her...
and that mean eyed cat"

When you know that horse you'll leave him alone 
The ole roan's got green in his eyes mean as the devil and twice as wise 
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack 
Come on children bend your back work a little faster fill your sack 
Then you hitch up the wagon take it to the gin finish pickin' before the winter sets in 

Now here while back when the crop was laid by 
Remember who took us on a big fish fry 
Caught a heap of catfish goggle eye and carp 
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp

Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin' there wings like a turtle dove

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of '92
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome
Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow
With the Northern Lights a runnin' wild in the Land of the Midnight Sun
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of nineteen-one

Way up north to Alaska, way up north to Alaska
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said, ""Sam you're a lookin' at a lonely, lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of golden place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome""

Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife;
Just serve me tomatoes; and mashed potatoes;
Give me the simple life.

Bridge:

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y;
Give me the simple life.

I'm crazy about sleep
Can't do without sleep
Give me the simple life

I don't aim to worry
Husstle or hurry
Give me the simple life

I greet the dawn when am waken
The sky is cleared up above
I like my scramble egg and bacon
Served by someone I love

Sounds corny and seedy but yes indeedy

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day.

I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before.

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind,
Life ain't worth livin,
Sometimes I feel like dyin'.

Goin' down to the river

Gonna take my ol' rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock away from there.

You been a hard-hearted mama
Great god! you been unkind
Gonna be a cold, cold papa
Cause you to lose your mind.

I'm gonna lay my head down
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen
Pacify my mind.

Well it's trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my worried mind,
When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'."

You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire

While that breeze on night sings a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above

You'd be so nice you'd be paradise
To come home to and love"

I got my man now I got Porgy
My baby understands now I got my Porgy
I'm through with bymays his way is may way forever more
Lord when i feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of a love for me
So I'm changing my style my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man got my Porgy now

Though you say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be

Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding (breathing? )

By and by, Lord, bye and bye?
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day;
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away.

Lord, I told the undertaker,
""Undertaker, please drive slow,
For this body you are hauling,
Lord, I hate to see her go.""

I followed close behind her,
Tried to hold up and be brave,
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave.

Went back home, Lord. My home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone,
All my brothers, sisters crying.
What a home so sad and lone!

Now my mother, she's crossed over
Where so many have gone before;
And I know, Lord, I will meet her
Just waiting at glory's door."

143,The Louvin Brothers,The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea,TRBVBGO128F934CB79,1960,"""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down

""Bring my darling boy to me""
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late

Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in heaven, his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

""Lord, have mercy on me""
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I know that God in heaven looked down"
144,The Louvin Brothers,The Drunkard's Doom,TRLRHZH128F934CB51,1960,"It was on one dark and starless night
I heard and saw an awful sight
The lightning flashed, the thunder rolled
Across my dark denial soul
I saw a gulf form down below
Where all the dying drunkards go
I saw another weeping crowd
Bloodshotten eyes and voices loud
""Come here young man, we'll give you room
This is the whiskey seller's doom""

I started there, got there at last
I thought I'd take a social glass
But every time I started in,
I thought about the drunkard's den
I smashed it down and left the place
I went to seek redeeming Grace
I felt like Paul who once did pray
For God to wash his sins away

I started home to change my life
To see my loving neglected wife
I found her weeping over the bed
Because our infant babe was dead
I told her not to cry or weep
Our little baby had gone to sleep
It's little soul had passed away
To ring with Christ an endless day
I took her by her lilly white hand
She was so weak she could not stand
I knelt her down and prayed a prayer
That God might save and bless us there

And now I live a better life
In a Christian home with a loving wife"
145,The Louvin Brothers,Satan Is Real,TRLOSUE128F1468957,1960,"Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray

I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
""My God is real""
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, ""Preacher, tell them that satan is real too""
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment

Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray"
146,The Louvin Brothers,Satan's Jeweled Crown,TRVLISA128F1468960,1960,"If I could be king or a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
I'd rather know that I had salvation
Then to know my reward was Satan's jewel crown
Satan's jewel crown I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me his own
And helped me cast off Satan's jewel crown

This life that I've lived so sinful and evil
Drinking and running around
All the things that I do, for the love of the devil
I know my reward is Satan's jewel crown"
147,The Louvin Brothers,Are You Afraid To Die,TROGODS128F146895C,1960,"Are you a stranger to God?
Carried away with your pride
Tell me, sinner, did you ever stop to think?
Are you afraid to die?

Are you too wicked to cry?
Would you to God's bosom fly?
Kneel with your mother
Stray not from her side
God will hear your cry

Are you afraid to die?
Will you have time for a prayer?
Soon He's coming, like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die?

Are you afraid?
Are you unsaved?
Are you afraid to die?

Call on Him while He is near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek Him while He may be found?
Are you afraid to die?

He not ashamed of this world
Judgement will meet everywhere
Trust with your heart and the work is done
Leave your burdons there

Are you afraid?
Are you unsaved?
Are you afraid to die?"

You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?"

151,Tom Lehrer,When You Are Old and Grey,TRQKCMR128F9323045,1960,"Spoken live introduction on Revisited:
The most popular type of popular song is of course the love song, 
And I'd like to illustrate several subspecies of this form during 
The evening.
First of all, the type of love song where the fellow tells the girl 
That although the years ahead will almost certainly destroy every 
Vestige of her already dubious charms, that nonetheless his love 
For her will shine on forever through the years, you know. Another 
Example of stark realism in the popular song.
This particular example is called ""When You Are Old And Grey,""
And I'd like to dedicate it to anyone in the audience who is still 
In love with each other.

Since I still appreciate you
Let's find love while we may
Because I know I'll hate you
When you are old and grey

So say you love me here and now
I'll make the most of that
Say you love and trust me 
For I know you'll disgust me . . .
When you're old and getting fat!

An awful debility
A lessened utility
A loss of mobility
Is a strong possibility
In all probability 
I'll lose my virility
And you your fertility 
And desirability
And this liability 
Of total sterility
Will leed to hostility 
And a sense of.. futility
So let's act with agility 
While we still have facility
For we'll soon reach senility 
And lose the ability . . .

Your teeth will start to go dear
Your waist will start to spread
In twenty years or so dear
I'll wish that you were dead

I'll never love you then at all
The way I do today
So please remember 
When I leave in December . . . 
I told you so in May"
