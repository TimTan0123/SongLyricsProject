0,Kaiser Chiefs,Good Days Bad Days,TRQOMKT128F92D7216,2008,"Follow the underdog
Hold on his collar tight
This city loves a scrap
One day it's gonna fight

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from having a good day 
On a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Making a night of it
Breaking the barriers
Drowning the sorrows
Upset the regulars

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Sticks and stones and animal bones
There's good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days

If you had a different attitude
Instead of take and take and take
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days"

2,Finley,Iris,TRWGDSK128F4261D84,2008,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
'Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
Who I am, Who I am, Who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

What's that song
Bring me a whiskey

The dreaming child
The father proud and strong
I kinda like that song
The one about the Earlie King

Daddy, I can see him
His coat's so shiny bright
Behind us in the night
I can see the Earlie King

Daddy, I can hear them
They're singing just for me
Can't you hear? Can't you see
The daughters of the Earlie King?

Spill the milk! Spill the meat!
Life is bitter and death is sweet!
All the bacon that a boy can eat!
Come along with me!

And the bad bells ring!
And the bad bells ring!
And I am running
Still running from the Earlie King!

And there's nothing there, nothing at all
Fairytales and folderol
Nothing to hear and nothing to see
Wind in the willow and light in the tree

The dreaming child
The father proud and strong
I kinda like that song
The one about the Earlie King

Daddy, can you hear me?
It's got so hard to speak
I'll kiss your bristly cheek
And go with the Earlie King

Up from the table
My brother's tiny soul
All gone, swallowed whole
Taken by the Earlie King

Spill the milk! Spill the meat!
Life is bitter and death is sweet!
All the bacon that a boy can eat!
Come along with me!

How ya doin' Baby. Oh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with those stilhettos baby. Ah, check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me? Ay, let me put this bug in your ear, baby. Won't you turn those flow shoes into your ho shoes, ya dig. yeah check this out. This universe fine as your royal highness. You know what, I can do a whole lotta things for you. Guess Why? Cause I'm a motherfuckin' pimp.

Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase
In this life, there's pimp's and ho's
Tell me which one are you, you little
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase

The good man in me say get money and stay on the path.

But the pimp shit in me say, yo, keep looking for ass
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow.

I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes

Better wait till you're grown, when they love you, you'll know.

Everybody's got a dream, I hope and wish to own a six times two
Chill in the whip a fantasy a bone to pick to get against who I don't know
To one who said you won't blow
You won't eat, you want cake, they mistake.
Blamin me for they failures I'm fresh.
Getting tailored, single breasted.
A lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit.

A woman hates a man and stay with him for many years. Tell him she loves then be jealous of him. Now lame is how the ghetto judge him. Cause he still with her. She take his cash and give it to some other real nigger.

7,Opeth,Den Standiga Resan (Album Version),TRXLMXT128F4248D61,2008,"När jag tänker på den ständiga resan
Genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst

Då vänder sej vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen
Genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg

Då gömmer sej solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst"

10,BENEDICTION,They Must Die Screaming,TRWNOET128F4274E7B,2008,"Destined for great power
Hidden secret of twisted faith
From sacrificial squalor
To disinterring amoral disgrace

Following in the footsteps
In the wrecking trail of the elusive witch
Effigies submerged in gore
With a headless beast for opposing the hitch
Sworn to Kadiempembe
An obsession with evil carved in flesh
Ritually cicatrised screaming
My soul is dead, I have no god

And with the gathered disciples
The chosen one's horizons spread
Immolations and unbelievers
Paying the devil's price in blood and dread

And with the decadent enraptured
Worshipping their twisted god
Boundless evil of El Padrino
A baron in the court of hell

Spiralling sadism
Lovers torn asunder, victims mutilated
Agony praised utmost
One vile commandment - they must die screaming

Flense the silent stoic
Yet his lack of screams fails to impress
Resultant rage volcanic
Seize innocence, desperate redress

But the shadow god has stumbled
Sorcerous facade now implode at once
Though the castellations crumble
The godfather will not be dead for long..."

Snuff movies and animal sex 
It burned my eyes and made them cry 
I didn't feel a thing

Already beat my memory 
No sense of attention 
I lost focus and feeling

All those years of computer screen 
My friends died of the same disease 
Wasted world so beautiful 
So full of life, pull the plug

Blackness 
Disconnect me 
You think this is funny 
You should have seen me

Wrapped in wet blankets 
And heavy sedation 
I tried to tell them no more 
But they weren't listening

All those years of computer screen 
My friends died of the same disease 
Wasted world so beautiful 
So full of life, pull the plug

All your saviors are crucified
All the shattered faith and losing belief 
Wasted world so beautiful 
So full of life, pull the plug

All your saviors are crucified
All the shattered faith and losing belief

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up
Because of you girl I never want to break up

The difference I'm feeling in my heart
Is the difference of loving or not
And under the stars and moon and sun
Is the perfect becoming of one

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up

If I told you that I loved like an ace
Then I'd be lying 'cause I've made some mistakes
But I'm trying with perfect faith
When I let you in
I began to win

And now I'm just all gold
After all I've done
And the road I've run
I want to thank you
I want to thank you

I have you to thank for making me so
So hard to please because you treated me so
Good that no one else could hold your make-up

16,Nach,Esclavos Del Destino,TRRJYAV128F4249E22,2008,"La codicia ha contaminado las almas de los hombres, ha levantado en el mundo barricadas de envidia, de rencor, los ha llevado a la miseria y a la matanza. Hemos crecido demasiado deprisa. ¿Y de qué ha servido? La tecnología, que proporciona abundancia, nos ha dejado en la indigencia. Nuestra ciencia nos ha hecho cínicos, nuestra inteligencia duros y vacíos. Hemos empezado a pensar pero hemos dejado de sentir. Nos hemos convertido en esclavos del destino.

¿Lo has pensado?
¿Realidad o imaginación?
Han dado órdenes al jefe del estado de cada nación,
conspiración
contra nuestra libertad lo llamo.
Respiramos ansiedad y no avanzamos.
Las empresas, modernas cámaras de gas,
autómatas sin nombre redactan otro informe más sobre el progreso.
¿Qué progreso?
Yo sólo veo chavales de primero de ESO adictos al exceso.
Nos aprietan las tuercas, la masa tuerta
no puede vivir sin el tono de un móvil cerca.
La educación es terca y nos amuerma, enferma,
porque el director contrata siempre al profesor mas pelma.
Así el coeficiente intelectual decrece su índice,
si alguien proclama que crece es otro cómplice y te miente.
La mayoría vende el culo,
se lo lame al jefe, asciende.
La escala social siempre.
Si fumo en tu local no habrá cohartada,
el humo de los coches es diez veces más mortal y nadie hace nada.
No salgas de la manada, calla y traga.
Saben que facturas debes, saben que facturas pagas.
Si apagas la televisión no hay otro entretenimiento
y el silencio entre dos se hace violento.
Hablar con sinceridad, llorar nuestra infelicidad
se toma como una muestra de debilidad.
¡Y me preocupo!
Ahora todo es trabajo en grupo
y del pensamiento único jamás se supo.
Creedlo, entrad en mi ojo para verlo,
hasta el lobo solitario ya se siente mal por serlo.
Mi gobierno es otro ejemplo de cinismo:
¿Un partido socialista que no practica el socialismo?
¿Dónde está el ideal de ayudar?
Hay que pagar hasta por respirar,
busca otro planeta al que emigrar.

Somos esclavos del destino,
así vivimos,
nos imponen las normas
y jamás nos resistimos.
Los jefes del presidente
dictan el presente.
¿Crees que quien gobierna
realmente no te miente?
Esclavos del destino,
así morimos,
nos tratan como escoria
y sin fuerzas nos rendimos.
Los jefes del presidente
dictan el presente.
¿Crees que no controlan
también tu mente?

El sistema penitenciario crea desconfianza,
hay que pagar una fianza que solo al rico le alcanza.
La desesperanza crea paranoya
y mi alcalde tiene tanta panza
que no ve su propia poya.
Niños que desaparecen sin dejar rastro,
sus padres padecen, ya no dan abasto.
Así el pueblo suplica más control sobre si mismo
y pronto le implantarán un gps al organismo.
Mecanismo para marionetas.
¿No sientes los hilos invisibles atados a la chaqueta?
Y como buenos ciudadanos nada nos inquieta,
no pensamos que el poder nos quiere ver con las manos quietas,
sólo moviendolas para currar,
y en tenernos ocupados en comprar, sin ningún motivo.
El precio de una vivienda de mierda es abusivo
y encima nos timan inventándose el euribor.
¿Crees que es ficticio?
El 90% sufre de estrés
para que el fin de mes no sea un suplicio.
Tu sacrificio no da beneficio,
sin tiempo de saludar ni al vecino en tu edificio.
Nos mueve el vicio y el morbo.
A veces pienso que el SIDA fue ideado para eliminar estorbos
y liquidar la libertad sexual,
mientras la iglesia dice que usar condón es pecado mortal.
Me revienta como ver que en laboratorios
saturan las grasas que luego nos alimentan,
así nuestra salud mental y física flaquea,
otro truco para hacer que obedezcas como sea.
La esclavitud total se acerca, ¿no la oléis?
¿No conocéis el mundo en el que permanecéis?
No os preocupéis,
da igual si no me creéis,
yo le escupo en la cara este mensaje al 6-6-6.

Somos esclavos del destino,
así vivimos,
nos imponen las normas
y jamás nos resistimos.
Los jefes del presidente
dictan el presente.
¿Crees que quien gobierna
realmente no te miente?
Esclavos del destino,
así morimos,
nos tratan como escoria
y sin fuerzas nos rendimos.
Los jefes del presidente
dictan el presente.
¿Crees que no controlan
también tu mente?

Ahora mi voz está llegando a miles de seres de todo el mundo, a hombres, mujeres y niños desesperados, víctimas de un sistema que oprime a los inocentes. A aquellos que puedan oírme les digo ¡que no desesperen! Nuestra desgracia es consecuencia de la pasajera avaricia y la amargura de los hombres que temen el camino del progreso humano. El odio de los hombres pasará y los gobernantes morirán. Y el poder que le quitaron al pueblo volverá al pueblo. ¡Soldados, no dejéis que el futuro os esclavice! ¡Luchad, luchad por la libertad!"
17,Light This City,Beginning with Release,TRAQSIM12903D0D123,2008,"Beginning with release
Second chances only create
Even more seconds to wait
Everyone starts over
Turns a new leaf
But you're weak
And even the weight
Proves much too heavy for a pest like yourself
Especially when you're already burdened
With a chip on your shoulder
That cuts as deep as her treachery

And this release
It won't be the end for me
Our tug of war taught me
Resilience and a few more things
I was only armed for battle
You see
But I didn't lose because I'm not lost
And you have to be strong to keep holding on
But it takes strength of mind
To know when to release

Is there a life
Without forgiveness
If I release
Will I still remember
I was only armed for battle
You see
But I didn't lose because I'm not lost
And you have to be strong to keep holding on
But it takes strength of mind to know when to release

You've been saving all your pennies just to flip the coin
Well, heads up high roller
All you're going to see is tails as you watch me leave
I never was your Lady Luck
And I'm fucking done
Being your second best
No need to worry about me
I'll bounce back from this with ease
What a shame you won't be so lucky
Cause you're not going up
And you're not going down
You'll just waver back and forth
Still impossible to please
Cause you're not going up
And you're sure as fuck not going down
You'll just waver back and forth
Still impossible to please

And this release
It won't be the end for me
Our tug of war taught me
Resilience and a few more things
I was only armed for battle
You see
But I didn't lose because I'm not lost
And you have to be strong to keep holding on
But it takes strength of mind
To know when to release

Is there a life
Without forgiveness
If I release
Will I still remember
I was only armed for battle
You see
But I didn't lose because I'm not lost
And you have to be strong to keep holding on
But it takes strength of mind to know when to release

You say
But we've only just begun
And I say
Our beginning is done
You never should have left
No
You never should have come"

In an instant replay
And all the familiar faces and familiar places
Just don't look the same
Yeah, I've been here forever
But I was born yesterday
There's so many ways to spin this
But if God is my witness
Well he'd probably say

That it's all because you gave me something
Just what I need, a love so deep
And it's all because you gave me something
And what can I do with a love so true?

I was a creature of habit
Yeah, I was a slave to the drink
My old friends drinking whiskey
And I'm sipping champagne
I don't care what they think
'Cause I got me an angel
And everything is all right
I mean what can I say, I was born yesterday
And I'll be born again tonight

And it's all because you gave me something
Just what I need, a love so deep
And it's all because you gave me something
And what can I do with a love so true?

And who knows what I'd be
If it had been up to me
I'd still be wandering (oh, and wondering)
And who knows what I'd find
Living deaf, living blind
Well, that devil's deceased
I will leave him behind

And it's all because you gave me something
Just what I need, and that's a love so deep
And it's all because you gave me something
And what can I do, what can I do with a love so true?

It's all because you gave me something
Just what I need, and that's a love, that's a love so deep

Where did they go, graceful in the morning light?
To banner fair
To follow you softly in the cold mountain air

Through the forest, down to your grave
Where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave
They do not know you anymore
More, more, more

Dear shadow, alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Into town, one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see
Anybody that dear to me

Dear shadow, alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

27,Kate Miller-Heidke,Caught In The Crowd,TRNCBKC128F9336B36,2008,"There was a guy at my school when I was in high school 
We'd ride side by side in the morning on our bicycles 
Never even spoken or faced each other 
But on the last hill we'd race each other 

When we reached the racks we'd each go our own way 
I wasn't in his classes, I didn't know his name 
When we finally got to speak he just stared at his feet 
And mumbled a sentence that ended with 'James' 

I was young and caught in the crowd 
I didn't know then what I know now 
I was dumb, and I was proud 
And I'm sorry 
If I could go back do it again 
I'd be someone you could call friend 
Please, please believe that I'm sorry

Well he was quite a big guy, kinda shy and quiet 
When the kids called him weird he didn't try to deny it 
Every lunchtime he'd spend walking by himself 
Round the boundary of the grounds til he heard the bell 

Well one day I found him, joined him on his walk 
We were silent for a while until we started to talk 
I told him my family were fighting in court 
He said his step-dad and him always fought 

We talked about music, he was into punk 
Told me all the bands that I liked were junk 
I said I'd never heard the songs the sex pistols sang 
I laughed back at him and then the bell rang 

I was young and caught in the crowd 
I didn't know then what I know now 
I was dumb, and I was proud 
And I'm sorry 
If I could go back do it again 
I'd be someone you could call friend 
Please, please believe that I'm sorry

It was after school in the afternoon 
The corridors were crowded as we came out of the rooms 
Three guys I knew pushed him into the cement 
Threw away his bag and said he had no friends 

He yelled that he did and he looked around 
Tried getting up but they pushed him on down 
That's when he saw me, called out my name 
And I turned my back, and just walked away
Yeah I turned my back, and just walked away

I was young and caught in the crowd 
I didn't know then what I know now 
I was dumb, and I was proud 
And I'm sorry

Wasn't sure what happened till it turned on the light



It turned on the light

I saw it comin'

A creature runnin'

Its demon eyes locked right on me

He said ""My Darling you're, dearly departed""

Held me tight and took a bite I sank into the night



Since that day I just haven't been the same

The curious that wander are my prey

They come rollin' in to be the heart of my sin

Take their souls and put them in their graves



Put them in their graves

You can say good bye

What are you looking for

There ain't no way you're getting out that door



Getting out that door

Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

I bust the windows out ya car

After five whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

Wander down the street
And I will be the pavement
beneath your feet

If we could just be immobile for some time
And finally figure out the way we feel
About the missing puzzle pieces
And cloudy question marks
That still look a bit surreal
Oh I tend to disappear here and there
So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air

38,Adele,Make You Feel My Love (album),TRIROTV128F92FEB97,2008,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"
39,Kalmah,Towards the Sky,TRRYPQM128F42480DC,2008,"Time crawls and time flies
Seasons wave when they're passing by
I'm walking along the shore
Wondering is this true or dream?

Now when world is covered with blood
Everything is filled with nothingness
The smoke has covered the sky
And the scene is filled with blackness

Production spitting shit
Into this God's gift
Consequences are taking us
We don't care future is here

The energy policy is just a word
Just a tool in a political battle
Time is right but who has got he key
That'll open the sky for the sun to gleam

Warnings and threats fall on deaf ears
Wilderness screams, it cries for help
And from his throne God is watching
The world with empty eyes

Up towards the sky
I send me prayer and
I want her to survive
But without the light she dies

And the cancer is wasting her lungs
I can feel that but I still stay hopeless
And the smoke in the sky won't dispel
And God is too busy to give a damn

Warnings and threats fall on deaf ears
Wilderness screams, it cries for help
And from his throne God is watching
The world with empty eyes

Up towards the sky
I send me prayer and
I want her to survive
But without the light she dies"

Que sin ti no funcionaré
Sería intentar volar sin alas

Sin ti el invierno será muy cruel
Ya no habrá hogueras en mi playa 

Y todo el tiempo que pasamos juntos
No lo olvidaré, será una mancha en el agua
Y cada noche que te amé lo juro
(La) recordaré, junto a la luna en mi cama 

Coro:
¡ay,ay,ay! Que será de ti
¡ay,ay,ay! Que (va ser) de mi
Si tú te alejas y yo me quedo
Muy solita aquí... 

¡ay,ay,ay! Que será de ti
¡ay,ay,ay! Que (va ser) de mí
Si tu te alejas y yo me quedo
Llorando por ti... (por)

Tú sabes bien ...
Que si me quitas del medio hoy
Voy a llorar un mar de lágrimas
Tu sabes bien...
No es tan fácil decir adiós
Y luego continuar en calma (oh no)

Y cuando lejos, muy lejos estés
Te recordaré, con tristeza en (tu) mirada
Y cuando el deseo entre en mi piel,
Imaginaré, tu mano bajo mi falda 

Porque será que el amor, el amor
Es como una ola
Cuando (llega) te besa (,) te abraza
Y con facilidad te abandona
Porque será mi amor
Que va a ser de mi
Si tu te alejas y yo me quedo

When will it stop?
Caught in the undertow

All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes

When will it stop?
No one forever young
When will it stop?
I'm caught in the undertow
When will it stop?
The brittle and bitter bones
When will it stop?
Forgot to know how to grow

All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes

42,Alice Cooper,Prologue/I know where you live,TRNHPXW128F930CAEF,2008,"We found his diary today. He wrote in great detail, how cleverly he planned
all of the killings. How precisely he executed his insane fantasies. It was
all so perfect except for one thing...
(one thing, one thing, one thing, one thing)

I like to watch from my car
I like to make sure you don't go far
I know the hours you sleep
Don't approve of the company that you keep

While you're in work I'm alone
In your room, on your bed and you'll never know
I like to go through your things
The touch, the smell, the joy it brings

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights

I don't like the guy in the suit
Or that street punk in the combat boots
You may not see them again
I showed them a quick but painful end

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights

I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you

I want to know what you say
I need to hear the prayers you pray
I like to play with your hair
When you sleep and you dream and there's no one there

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where you're spending your nights

I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you

Boys like you cant buy no ring

Turn around a minute And away we go

Billy walked inside, ordered up a drink
He started gettin nervous and a wonderin
what shed think
She thought he looked nice, rough around
the seams
Just the kind of boy who could listen to
her dreams
And who knows Katie? Maybe he could be the one

Well, they stepped outside, and took a
little walk
Katie held his hand and Billy even talked
They sat by the pond, they didnt make a

The night fell easy as the moon came
down
And who knows baby?
Maybe we could be the one

46,After The Burial,Aspiration,TRGXIFG12903CA6DB0,2008,"Victim of anger, tied to distance
Where does it come from?
Distrust.
I've stood strong,
Held my head high through constant war.
So brutal, so violent.

So I tiptoe through conversation,
A lapse in my step is misperceived.
Unleash a breath of salvation,
In dormancy lies everlasting.

Remember all the fires we started?
Our aspirations for progression.
We feed the burning for a better day,
Don't let your selfishness extinguish the flame.

Prevailing with lasting intentions,
Never living behind your back.
Never living behind your...
Convictions leave me questioning
If you've been living behind mine."
47,Pierre de Reeder,That's the Way That It Was,TRQPULR12903CDA328,2008,"Do you remember when we were kids?
And the way that it was
Build a mountain of anything
And look out from the top
And bring a handful of rocks from school
Put them in a secret place in your room
But I don't know why we never think of ourselves that way
We held the world in our hands by doing something that everyone does
That's the way that is was

You cover all of your tracks
With pride, shame, and dust
Living like your saving for
When you're down on your luck
But I know you're trying to get ahead
You came over to me and said, ""It's all OK.""
You're thinking about this way too much
Your best friend, keeping your chin-up
But the feeling faded away at the end of the day

Hey, there are plenty of people I know
Who don't give their worth
They've said it's something they hide to outgrow
But I gave each one hell because they won't say what's really missing for them
But they wouldn't listen because
That's the way that it was
That's the way that it was
That's the way that it was
That's the way that it was
That's the way that it was
That's the way that it was"
48,The BellRays,That's not the way it should be,TROXWPN12903CAF1F4,2008,"Every now and then I get a little bit angry
with your children.
It makes me want to cry and then it make me want to be the one
who teaches them

But they just stand there looking
Like they’re at a zoo

Between you and me
That’s not the way that it should be

People feel guilty when they see the dead walking
through the city.
Pull a dollar from their pockets for a little tin cup
to make them go away

Well no one here’s applauding
his act of mercy.

Between you and me
That’s not the way that it should be

Birds of prey are diving on the field mice are running
from the war machines
Stay long enough to get a laugh
and they’re on their way again

No one stops to wonder
Where it all ends

The homeless and poor are glad to go to war
to fight for the right to be put down even more
the drugs that you buy cost to much to get us high
And the kids across the nation fight to get an education"
49,Late Of The Pier,Space And The Woods (Cenzo Townshend Mix) (Explicit),TROLJYR128F423F794,2008,"Suicide is in my blood
It always was
But it doesn't evaporate, in the light any more
And this world is no place
For a mind, or a thought
No it's not
Well that's been said before
The space and the woods, still know who I am
And I know, they don't owe me anything, not after what I've done

Put on my radiation suit and slip away
I'm on the run from what I've become
And this life finds suicide
Picks up a whole lot of different speeds
And I know, they don't owe me anything
Not after what I've done

Late on a Monday night
I'm on the grapevine
Beating around the bush
And to the baseline
Thinking about the time
When I was dancing, slow
And out of control

I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I don't care
I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I've done nothing
I've done nothing

But they forgive anything
Like, how, I, don't, stop, you
Breaking my arms
And chopping me, chopping me down
So I fit in your laptop

I've done nothing
nothing"

The fortune lady
Came along, she walked beside

But every word seemed to date her

Up and on the ride
Drive into Corning
And all the spindles whine

And everyday is getting straighter

Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do

You were always going steady
Up there on the fence

And when love came around
My guard was never down
I was quick on my feet

And I never would've thought
That I'd ever get caught
With my heart on my sleeve

Yeah I know it's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front 
Of a train, train, train
Just to water your flowers 
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do 
Just to be with
You, You, Yeah, You

Well I would run every stop sign
And I don't care
I would always be the first one there

Just to see that look in your eyes
When you know that you never have to, have to ask me twice

Yeah I know it's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front 
Of a train, train, train
Just to wash your car
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do 
Just to be with
You, You, You

Just to hold your hand
Water your flowers
Hm, just to be with
You, You, You"

You had the last words baby, and I'm wondering why.

Do you really want to hurt me baby?
I never wanted this to happen.
You've been acting crazy, so Haley...

From the start off, it was the beginning.
You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself pretty well.
And I know myself pretty well.

From the start off, it was the beginning.
You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself pretty well.
And I know myself pretty well.

It was a bonfire waiting to happen.
It was a hurricane that pulled us through.
So I sat down and figured it out,
and thought all about how things were better the first time.

From the start off, it was the beginning.
You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself pretty well.
And I know myself pretty well.

From the start off, it was the beginning.
You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself pretty well.
And I know myself pretty well.

I couldn't make my ????
You're here for a week, but you're gone again.

You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself pretty well.

I knew it's worth the while
I've put my faith in time
To cradle her in my arms

Eden in her eyes
Pictured in my mind
Was only a matter of time
Till I see my baby's eyes

It's been a long wait until
These changes I feel
Could all this be
A dream that turns real

My reflection will tell
There's a life within me
Breathing silently

Eden in her eyes
I knew it's worth the while
I've put my faith in time
To cradle her in my arms

Eden in her eyes
Pictured in my mind
Was only a matter of time
Till I see my baby's eyes

It's so hard to describe
I don't know where to start
What the words can't say
I'll leave it that way

Now the mirror can sing
Always knew you'd arrive in my life
Waiting is believing

Eden in her eyes
I knew it's worth the while
I've put my faith in time
To cradle her in my arms

Eden in her eyes
Pictured in my mind
Was only a matter of time
Till I see my baby's eyes

She is my ray of light
That vanished my darkest nights
Now life is sweet as candy
I banished my sugar-free side

And the warmth that I feel
Each time I realized that she's here
Makes me know that God loves me

I knew it's worth the while
I've put my faith in time
Eden in her eyes
Pictured in my mind
Was only a matter of time
Till I see my baby's eyes"

60,Jolie Holland,Corrido Por Buddy,TRVBGLQ128F92D2884,2008,"Oh, listen my dear friends and I’ll tell you a story
About someone I barely knew at all
He was a friend of my friends and they told me about him
How he had nothing to break his fall

He had that bad religion in his blood
The kind that brings you down and can never lift you up

He was a beautiful young man on the streets of Austin
He was a ghost faced junkie on the streets of New Orleans
I could barely recognize him when I saw him
He had to look me in the face and say my name before I knew it was him

Oh buddy, I wish I’d been a better friend

What if they only gave you love when you lied?
It’s bound to really rip you up inside
Pressures a person into that horrible mouth that leaves a bloody aftermath
Everything minus one is everything

He treated me with what I considered kindness
When I crawled off to sleep in my car he was worried about me
When we paid our respects to the moon on the outskirts of Austin
I’m sorry to say I was too shy to stay in touch with him

Oh buddy, I wish I’d been a better friend

And I wonder what it takes just to save one little life
Icarus almost made it back to the shore
When I was really down, there were three little words
From a couple of good people that kept me holding on

Oh buddy, I’ll never get a chance again
Oh buddy, I wish I’d been a better friend
Oh buddy, I’ll never get a chance again
Oh buddy, I wish I’d been a better friend"

It's more than boys and girls and late nights

I waited
Waited but she didn't care

My fingertips and toes are frozen to the bone
Give me an hour before you throw me in the cold

Ring ring ring
Now I hear the phone singing
Calling me
Telling me to start freezing

Just like Walt Disney
I'm a block of ice

Give me an hour before you pick me up and throw me 'cross the sea

To keep the water down
And a high tide from the ocean
Spread the water over the town

Wasn't that a mighty storm,
Wasn't that a mighty storm,
It blew the people all away

You know the trumpets gave them warning,
You'd better leave this place,
Now no one thought of leaving,
'Til Death stared them in the face
And the trains they all were loaded
The people were all leaving town,
The trestles gave way to the water
And the trains they went on down, now

Rain it was a fallin'
Thunder began to roll
Lightning flashed like hellfire
The wind began to blow
And the seas began to rollin'
And the ships they could not stand 
And I heard a captain crying
Good God save a drownin' man

Death, your hands are clammy
You got them on my knee
You come and took my mother,
Won't you come back for me?
Death you cruel master,
When the wind began to blow
Rode in on a team of horses
Cried oh Death won't you let me go?

Schamlos nimmt der dreiste Dieb
Denn er ist seines Glückes Schmied

Wovon die Andern träumen
Raub ich in der Nacht
Mein Gang gleicht einem Hochzeitsschimmel
Ein furchtloser König
Von Söldnern bewacht
Ein eigener Gott, in meinem Himmel

Am Strick hormoneller Wut

Wir turteln recht steril
Hinter dieser rosa Pappwand
Und du erreichst den nächsten Hof
Mit Müh und Not
In deinen Armen
Das Kind war tot


Steck deine Hand in meine Tasche

There was a time when I was young
Feeling I couldn't carry on
Words just fell like rain from my lips into the sea
Fallen down too many times
In this heart I realized
To pick yourself up when there is no one else around

And I know I was so wrong
Don't know why it took so long
To break this loneliness inside I couldn't see

As I lie here in this bed
With all these words I haven't said
Next to you this silence makes me feel so free

Would be there all alone
Emptiness would take a place you feel inside
As we walk out of the night
There's no no clause that I can write
An empty verse would curse the time I hold you still

Hold me close, don't let me go
It's too hard being all alone
As you sleep I feel it saved myself from me
And we stand so strong
Let this be our favorite song
And we'll sing it as we walk into the sun

(And we stand so strong)
(And we stand so strong)

Everyone gets blue about something sometimes
The loneliness and the sadness
Personal problems, everyday life
The desire for release, long hours of labor
And the hope for a better life hereafter

Forever is never too long to wait

Some day soon we'll be together
Where a moment lasts forever

Mentre la ripetitività sgretola le reliquie del talento

To an abyssal trench where hatred embodies does lie.

For he banishes the killers and beasts of this land.
Justice will be served to the sins deep withheld
In eternal battle at dark rules demand.

A relentless parasitic cyst; your disease infecting our mother's womb.
Your life now lacking it's worth shall be locked in an eternal tomb.

We're dormant accumulations of flesh
In a crimson filtered twilight
Mute witnesses to the game
Wrenches to keep the bolts of lies tight

We're the fabric concealing the stains,
The red tainted existence
The gullibles to bless your sins away
Rags to wipe your blooded trails

We give in to the atrophy,
To the twining of self-thought knowledge
The purpose of the human mind reviled
Everlasting ignorance realized
The scarlet flood inundates our powerless thoughts
Defenseless minds with lies overfed

Fend for your life as your strength descends 
Your defenses have fallen 
Against the masses you were born into

Retribution, execution, sentenced for your false delusions 
You have chosen to be disfavored by your equals as a traitor 
Traitor, your acts of sedition has had you punished by death 
For your betrayal 
Execution sentence for your acts of treason"

There's a fat man standing
By the soda machine
And he knows, he knows, he knows
Life can be funny

He calls the hair salon
Says put Loretta on
'Cause the mall just called and
Said the last guy's gone
And I know, I know God knows
We need the money

He's a big red cherry
But it's hard to be merry
When the kids are all laughing
Saying, hey it's Jerry Garcia
Ain't he cute?
The man in the Santa suit

And all the moms in town
They bring their brats around
But they can't keep still or
Keep their root beer down
Now it's up, hey how 'bout that
It looks like a milkshake

And Jimmy's grown this year
Says mommy, quick come here
Santa's sweaty and he smells like beer
And he says, hey kid shut your mouth
You give me a headache

And he's jolly and hairy
But it's hard to be merry
When the guys at the bar
Say he looks like a fairy
But he's doing it just for the loot

Underneath the skin,
An empty space to fill in

Well, there's so many sinking

You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs

No one waving for me just the shoreline receding
Ticket in my hand, I'm thinking wish I didn't hand it in

'Cause who said sailing is fine?
Leaving behind all the faces that I might replace
If I tried on that long ride
Looking deep inside but I don't want to look so deep inside yet

Sit down, sit down on the prow to wave bye
There might not be another star further on the line
Look out, look out at each town that glides by
And there's another crowd to drown in crying eyes

And see how that light you love now just won't shine
Well, there might just be another star that's high and far in some other sky
We sing, ""Is that marionette real enough yet
To step off of that set to decide what her hands might be doing?
Ruining the play, to in the ensuing melee escape.""

We packed up all of our bags
The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks
As we pace beneath flags black and battered
Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord

And we sail out on orders from him but we find
The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines
Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined
And we don't recognize the names upon these signs

And every night finds us rocking and rolling on waves wild and white
Well, we have lost our way, nobody's gonna say it outright

This road is strange, so strange, strange my dear
You know it really hurts inside yeah, sometimes
And no matter how good you are to people you know
They'll make you cry sometimes yeah, sometimes

There's have been a few days when people truly let me down
And said crucial things just to bring me down
And they will rob beg and cheat just for the own self-motives and greed
But I guess it ain't nothing new just something I gotta go through

This road is strange, so strange it is
You know it really hurts sometimes yeah, sometimes
No matter how good you are to people you know
They'll make you cry sometimes yeah, sometimes

Now how much more can I take before I shot to kill
Don't let them mess with your heart
'Cause what you feel is very real, yeah, yeah

You know it makes me cry sometimes baby, sometimes
Yes it does
Out of all the days and all the stories you taught me about
You know it still hurts inside yeah, sometimes, sometimes

I go through life with my hands in the air saying oh Lord help me there

Mark my words, better me than you

We was brought up in a battle ground
Every third day, thugs be comin' around
They been sent the way 'cause we were bound
To bear the burden of what went down

It was our business
Even if it hurt we were self righteous
Social services parked outside
Tried to take us away
Mama wouldn't abide, na, na, na

We've laughed and we've cried
Through the hardships we've been tied
You gotta chose your battles right
Know when to forfeit, know when to fight

We get a little bit closer every time we ride
A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

That's how we roll in my family
To add insult to injury
If you use a knife, cut straight to bone
Go hard or go home

A couple cuts and bruises were easy to hide
Sun glasses hide a black eye
But you can't run away from a black soul
So many secrets we never told

Why your clothes be dirty'
Why your hair all messy'
Why you look so ill'
Couldn't pay the water bill

Had to keep the light on for the homework
So excuse us, we got a couple of quirks
I trivialize 'cause the truth hurts
So much more than a little dirt
Even if it's all bottled up inside
It's a lot more noble than a suicide

We survive, we alive, we got pride
We be tight
You know we ride to a certain degree
To keep that shit in the family

We get a little bit closer every time we ride
A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

That's how we roll in my family
To add insult to injury
If you use a knife, cut straight to bone
Go hard or go home

It takes a lot more courage to love
Than it does to hate
Anyone who's got a family can relate
Ain't never really dissipates
May take my whole life to get it straight
But it makes me who I am
And I wouldn't trade that for nothin'

We get a little bit closer every time we ride
A little bit tougher every time we die
A little better 'cause at least we tried
A little bit nicer 'cause we know we fly

i crumble to my knees 
i lick your frozen treasure 
you cup my furry bees
but one bee bubbles over 
your fleshy brimming cup 
it falls into the clover
and lands all downside up
it crawls across your stomach 
not far above the food 
that you are still digesting
inside your large intestine
and into your hydrangea
it draws its furry legs
you're crouching like a stranger
that aches to lay her eggs
in ecstacy of pressure
you quiver in the jam
while naked angels measure
a piece of rotting ham
in symphonies of jelly
you play with my disease
while back across your belly
there crawl dusty bees"

Tied up to the ground

I fashioned you from jewels and stone
I made you in the image of myself
I gave you everything you wanted
So you would never know anything else

But every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingers
Into cold sunlight, laughing at the things that I had planned
The map of my world gets smaller as I sit here
Pulling at the loose threads now

Did you want to be famous?

And when the cup is empty
I drink from nothingness
The venom by which I disintegrate

This is not merely pride
Or lust for eminence
This is the reoccurring cycle of my existence

As the sun returns
From the shades of night
So am I reborn from my own corruption

Que de tanto dar y dar a cambio de dar
Al final se queda solo

Callo, por que la palabra no define lo que llevo dentro
Que ni uno mismo es dueño de sus sentimientos
Un buen día todo cambia sin saber por que

Callo, que al final de todo las palabras se las lleva el viento
Y otra vez las olas son nuestros lamentos
Por eso lo que siento yo me lo callo

Callo, que lo que no quiero hacerles daño
Que con el amor tú sabes no se puede jugar
Hay amores que pueden matar
Y dejar a tiempo que nos diga la verdad
Por que hoy estamos y mañana...

Callo, porque la palabra no define lo que llevo dentro
Que ni uno mismo es dueño de sus sentimientos
Un buen día todo cambia sin saber por que

Callo, que al final de todo las palabras se las lleva el viento
Y otra vez las olas son nuestros lamentos
Por eso lo que siento yo me lo callo

Lo que llevo dentro yo me lo callo (coro)
Lo que siento me lo callo
Lo que llevo dentro yo me lo callo (coro)
Ay para no haremos daño
Lo que llevo dentro yo me lo callo (coro)
Lo que siento aquí adentro yo me lo callo
Lo que llevo dentro yo me lo callo (coro)
Por que la palabra las palabras se las lleva el viento
Se las lleva el viento
Lo que llevo dentro yo me lo callo (coro)
Lo que siento me lo callo"

Two blocks from the start
Two blocks from a war
Two blocks from the heart

I'm a sucker, I'm a fake
Just a snack on a dinner plate
A dancing monkey, a slimy snake
Concealed my destiny
And ruled my faith

Here I am, rolling down the slope
Counting down, watching out for the final blow
And I don't know, and I don't see how it's killing me
Who's the winner, who is not, here I am

Two blocks from the edge
Two blocks from the start
Two blocks from a war
Two blocks from the heart

The more you learn, the less you know
The more you find out on your own
Will form the person known as you

The more you fake, the less you fly
This cabaret of dirty lies
Has put stars in people's eyes

Here I am at the end of the rope
Checking out, speeding up, when the world is slow
What's the question, what's the answer, this life is killing me
What's the matter, what's the point, here I am

Two blocks from the edge
Two blocks from the start
Two blocks from a war
Two blocks from the heart

What's the matter, what's the point
Up or down, flip a coin

Two blocks from the start
Two blocks from a war
Two blocks from the heart"

My pockets full of gold
Thought then there was something to receive
Down and burned out from the quest
The things I tried to reach just weren't real
I used to live alone
And always had the feeling I was wrong
But how could they have lied
I buried all my dreams and there was
Nothing left to hide...

Leave this world by night
Nothing left behind
Trapped it all inside
Bound and weakened

Gone
The powers that I won
And yet I fight as long as rain keeps falling on me
I choose to die alone
But either way I pick
It always feels so wrong

Leave this world by night
Nothing left behind
Trapped it all inside
Bound and weakened"

A birthday gift to show you ca-are, I'm the guy who gets it there!

Chorus

(Verse #2)
Not rain or snow or gloom of ni-ight, mosquito bites or a busted light
Nor smelly smells or scary sounds will keep me from my postal rounds
An envelope or package, a parcel or box, or a 53-pound bag of dirt and bricks and rocks
The size, it doesn't matter, the weight, I just don't care
As long as there's a postage stamp, the mailman gets it there!

Charging around with a juggernaut brow
Overdraft speeches and deadlines to make
Cramming commitments like cats in a sack
Telephone burn and a purposeful gait

When out of a doorway the tentacles stretch
Of a song that I know and the world moves in slow-mo
Straight to my head like the first cigarette of the day

And it's you and it's May
And we're sleeping through the day
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

Do I have time? A man of my calibre?
Stood in the street like a sleepwalking teenager?
No. And I dealt with this years ago
I took a hammer to every memento

But image on image like beads on a rosary
Pull through my head as the music takes hold
And the sickener hits, I could work till I break
But I love the bones of you, that I will never escape

And it's you and it's May
And we're sleeping through the day
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

And I can't move my arm
For the fear that you will wake
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

And it's you and its May

Whirling cognition
Ulterior, the failing of words

A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home

Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light

Vastness engulfing the soul
Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness
The grain has to die, perish to bestow new life

A vis major painting a rapturous view
Heralding a vivid thema

Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like bearing in pain
Like embracing life and decaying in death
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma
I will not forget what I arose from

Decidual, the forests proclaim
The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy
Vanquishing the vile
Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life

Crave for the rapture again
Long for the pristine light"

Something is hiding
Something I never knew
If I'm open and honest
Keeping my promise
Someday I'll see this through

Listening, I'm listening
I need the space to move
Breaking through to something new
I need the chance to feel something real, something real
Everything I know is spinning out of control

So, so, so tell me where do we go

We all want something more than just a simple life
Hey, hey, so give me something to say
I had the words but then I through them away, and you know
We all want something more than just a simple life

Wait for the right time
How can I know for sure
They'll tell you how to get by
Just put your life on standby
And in the end you hope that you were right

Irish whiskey glass
Here comes my fine bright haired lass
Like a trash fire burning and burning it
My heart could never right the words never fail

Tucked under your cap and for a moment
There's a stillness before the room spins again

Ride it out so you can tell

Wasted on the weekend
Making good time with my excuse
Where the plot lines are like dead ends

Floating in her eyes ride it out for a spell

Dress them in secrets no one can hold
The fire dies in the distance, as the embers grow cold

Sing for me now
All the world is as stage
Smile take a bow
From your guilded cage

Behind the glass, she's safe where no one can reach her
Roses with thorns just make her bleed
A fragile porcelain angel breaks easily

Sing for me now
All the world is as stage
Smile take a bow
From your guilded cage

The restless heart
Cries when no one is listening
She's waiting for someone, waiting for you
To want, love and need her
To help her make it through
As the moment grows old
In her gilded cage"
