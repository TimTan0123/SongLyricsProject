I lost a good woman
An I grieve both night an day
I lost a good woman
An I grieve both night an day
I catch the blues for my baby
Ever since she's been gone away

I'm so unhappy
Mama, when I used to be so gay
I'm so unhappy 
Baby, when I used to be so gay


I catch the blues for my baby
Ever since she been gone away

I watches the sun
When it rises
Until it fades away
I watch the sun when it rise
Until it fades away
I catch the blues for my baby
Ever since she's been gone away

'Yeah, boy'

(piano boogie, drums, guiar)

Catch it long as I live
You will always hear me sing
Just as long as I live
Mama, you will always hear me sing
I catch the blues for my baby
Ever since she's been gone away.

1,Bing Crosby,Let's Start The New Year Right,TRHRDAX12903C94F7B,1942,"Bing Crosby/Bob Crosby Orchestra

Written by:  

Peaked Billboard position #18 in 1943

One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello

Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin

Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in

Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?"
2,Bing Crosby,White Christmas,TRBSAAI12903C9EC72,1942,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white



Version on Seasons Greetings:
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the tree-tops glisten and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow 

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
""May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white"""
3,Hoagy Carmichael,Hong Kong Blues,TRARAXJ128F932D82C,1942,"It's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong

And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he says his home's in Frisco where they send the rice
But it's really in Tennessee

That's why he said, ""I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there
I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me for happiness once again""

Won't somebody believe
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Every time I try to leave
Sweet opium won't let me fly away

I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there

That's the story of a very unfortunate colored man
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong"
4,Lucienne Delyle,Mon amant de Saint-Jean,TRYWNAO12903CE135A,1942,"1 - Je ne sais pourquoi j'allais danser
A Saint-Jean au musette,
Mais quand un gars m'a pris un baiser,
J'ai frissonné, j'étais chipée
Comment ne pas perdre la tête,
Serrée par des bras audacieux
Car l'on croit toujours
Aux doux mots d'amour
Quand ils sont dits avec les yeux
Moi qui l'aimais tant,
Je le trouvais le plus beau de Saint-Jean,
Je restais grisée
Sans volonté
Sous ses baisers.

2 - Sans plus réfléchir, je lui donnais
Le meilleur de mon être
Beau parleur chaque fois qu'il mentait,
Je le savais, mais je l'aimais.
Comment ne pas perdre la tête,
Serrée par des bras audacieux
Car l'on croit toujours
Aux doux mots d'amour
Quand ils sont dits avec les yeux
Moi qui l'aimais tant,
Je le trouvais le plus beau de Saint-Jean,
Je restais grisée
Sans volonté
Sous ses baisers.

3 - Mais hélas, à Saint-Jean comme ailleurs
Un serment n'est qu'un leurre
J'étais folle de croire au bonheur,
Et de vouloir garder son cur.
Comment ne pas perdre la tête,
Serrée par des bras audacieux
Car l'on croit toujours
Aux doux mots d'amour
Quand ils sont dits avec les yeux
Moi qui l'aimais tant,
Mon bel amour, mon amant de Saint-Jean,
Il ne m'aime plus
C'est du passé
N'en parlons plus."
5,The Mills Brothers,I'll Be Around,TRLVGZR128F93224A4,1942,"I'll be around
No matter how 
You treat me now 
I'll be around from now on

Your latest love 
Can never last
And when its past
I'll be around when he's gone 

Good-bye again
And if you find a love like mine 
Just now and then
Oh drop a line to say you 're feeling fine 

And when things go wrong 
Perhaps you'll see 
You're meant for me 
So I'll be around when he's gone

Good-bye again
And if you find a love like mine 
Just now and then
h drop a line to say your feeling fine 

And when things go wrong 
Perhaps you'll see 
You're meant for me 
So I'll be around when he's gone"
6,The Mills Brothers,Paper Doll,TRENQDX128F4249B80,1942,"I'm gonna buy a paper doll that I can call my own
A doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real

When I come home at night she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl

I guess I had a million dolls or more
I guess I've played the doll game o'er and o'er
I just quarrelled with Sue, that's why I'm blue
She's gone away and left me just like all dolls do

I'll tell you boys, it's tough to be alone
And it's tough to love a doll that's not your own
I'm through with all of them, I'll never fall again
Say boy, whatcha gonna do?

I'm gonna buy a paper doll that I can call my own
A doll that other fellows cannot steal
And then the flirty, flirty guys with their flirty, flirty eyes
Will have to flirt with dollies that are real

When I come home at night she will be waiting
She'll be the truest doll in all this world
I'd rather have a paper doll to call my own
Than have a fickle-minded real live girl"
