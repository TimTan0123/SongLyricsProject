0,Con Funk Shun,Love's Train,TRNOICF128F14775C4,1982,"Warm night, can't sleep, too hurt, too weak
Gotta call her up
Dial that, number, no one, answers
Till it's two o'clock

And if by chance, you let me come over
Out on the street, I want to see ya baby
And if by chance you let me just hold ya
I'm down on my knee, I wanna please ya baby, I
(I'll be your righteous lover)

She said ""Sugar, Honey, Darlin'
I really wanna see ya too
It's just that someone's, over, and baby
I really wanna be with chu'

But if by chance you let me just hold ya
I'm calling I'm free, I wanna see ya baby
When in need you said you would be here
And you hold the key
To my very being baby and I
(I...love you, baby)

If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train

Sometimes heart strings can be broken
But you've just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train

On a warm night, lady, wants her, baby
So she calls him up
Dial that, number, no one, answers
Till it's two o'clock

If by chance, you just come over
'Cause darlin' please, I've got to see ya baby
And when in need you said you would be here
And now I'm in need and please believe me baby
I love you darlin'
(Listen babe)

If you are that special lover
Love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(You don't need no, you don't need no ticket to ride)

Sometimes heart strings can be broken
But you've just got to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Listen babe, listen baby)

If deep sorrow you've been soakin'
But you've just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Loves a hurting thang ya'll that makes you want to cry, come on)

If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Find yourself alone)

Sometimes heart strings can be broken
But you've just have to keep on flowin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(In time everything's gonna be alright)

If deep sorrow you've been soakin'
But you've just got to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train"
1,Karla Bonoff,I Don't Want To Miss You,TRYQZLP128F4267C51,1982,"Oh honey, letæ¯ draw the line
æause I know you can't really be mine
I can see it's your own heart you need to find, not mine
And lately, I can see it won't turn out the way we
want it to be
We should forget it, and not regret it
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

CHORUS
æause I don't want to miss you
I don't want to kiss you
Or hear the sweet things that you say
Don't want to know what I'm missing
I Don't want to listen
Just want to watch you walking away

I remember you and I
And we looked into each other's eyes
We could make the long, long night just fly right by
But love's illusions don't seem to last
Maybe we just moved too fast
So please don't call me
Don't speak softly
Oh no honey, don't tempt me

CHORUS

Even though I know this is right
Can't stop dreaming about you at night
With or without you, it's still a fight every night
and me, I didn't know the way your heart could grow
so cold
But me, I'd let go, let my love show
Oh on honey, don't tempt me

CHORUS"
2,Dave Edmunds,Generation Rumble,TRTBQEY128F92CF188,1982,"Mother and daughter fighting it out
Who's gonna stay home tonight
Who wears the make up, hangs on the phone
It always seems to end in a fight
It don't seem long since momma was a child bride

She got married in a hurry
Sixteen years old on the day
Ooh what a wedding, driving 'til dawn
With a rock n'roll band to play
She wore black when daddy gave the the bride away

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's getting married but she's still her daddy's little girl

Now the years roll by - the family brings
Big changes onto the scene
Sweet sixteen's turned thirty four
But boy, she's still the same little queen
Life's full of trips - she's gonna follow every dream

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl

Mother and daughter fighting it out
Who's gonna get their own way
Doctor says, ""Take it easy now
Take two of these every day.""
Doctor, doctor, you can throw your pills away

It's just a generation rumble
A war between two worlds
Givin' momma lots of trouble
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl
Baby's grown up, but momma's still the same old girl."
3,Sergio Mendes,Rainbow's End,TRXDOFU128F93211BB,1982,"Who looks at her life
In the palm of her hand
Rain's on the roof
There's tears in the land
Of heartbreak
She's made up her mind
She won't turn back again
She writes a note
But words just won't say
Turns off the TV
Pulls down the shade
She's leaving
No, she won't change her mind
To leave it all behind

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

Who's playin' cards
From midnight 'til dawn
Lives in a wasteland
Yesterday's gone
Forever
He's made up his mind
To leave it all behind
So he says to himself
As he folds up his hand
Who of my friends will understand were
I'm goin'
To find my own way
I won't turn back again

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

I have a dream that I hold in my heart
And I won't let go
Welcome tomorrow - I'm on my way
So goodbye yesterday
Goodbye yesterday

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another penny in the wishing well
Bound for the rainbow's end
Don't you turn back again

Just one more story from a lonely heart
A twist of fate and then a start for home
Bound for the rainbow's end
Just one more chapter in this sad old tale
Another . . ."
4,Cock Sparrer,Argy Bargy,TRAZJAS128F4265580,1982,"it started off like any other show. 
sunday nights on the radio. 
terry played the songs we wanted to hear. 
and terry said things no one else would dare. 
he gave it all that he had to give. 
they said it was his only reason to live. 
but we just listened to the ruck n roll. 
terry the dj's radio show. 
he give it some of that argy bargy. 
giving it all the chat. 
he give it some argy bargy. 
now what do you think of that. 
then came the evening of the mile end row. 
the ol' bill found out i don't know how. 
we know they tried to lock us up that night. 
we were ready for a fight. 
terry came onto the air at ten. 
he said the filth were waiting for us then. 
down at the black boy they were there in force. 
and he war right of course. 
they told him that he'd better change the song. 
they said to tell us that the kids were wrong. 
they gave him one more sunday night, to get it right. 
that was the night when the girls all cried. 
that was the night that he said goodbye. 
'cos no matter who paid him, terry never told us a lie."
5,Jimmy Buffett,If I Could Just Get It On Paper,TRQAIMQ128F1467305,1982,"If I could just get it on paper
The things that have happened tonight
That seems to me to be the big key
I'm havin' too good a time to ever turn out the lights

Go to bed, wake up with a clear head
Recallin' what made it a ball
Yes, if I could just get it on paper
I might make some sense of it all

If I could tell half of the stories
The funny way most things begin
Figure ways to disguise all the half-truths and lies
Find the heart of my song with the point of a pen

Simple words can become clever phrases
And chapters could turn into books
Yes, if I could just get it on paper
But it's harder than it ever looks

All alone on the edge of the water
Hidin' out by the sea of Cortez
With my sketch pads and flairs
Tapes and battery spares
It's just no comprehendo to what everyone says

Time alone seemed to work well for Faulkner
Time away seems to work for the kid
Life and ink they run out at the same time
Or so said my old friend the Squid

Yes, if I could just get it on paper tonight
I could tell you what I think I did"
6,Stacy Lattisaw,I Could Love You So Divine,TRVQVYS128F92E96C0,1982,"On a summer day,
We're walking hand in hand on a beach made for two
On a summer day,
I'm dreaming sweet dreams of you

Ooh
I could love you so divine
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you so divine
Both me and you

On an autumn day,
We're skipping through the leaves like a couple of kids
On an autumn day,
I'm telling you how much I care

Ooh
I could love you so divine
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you so divine
Both me and you

When I wake up in the morning
I feel so grateful for seeing the light
I want to tell you I've been waiting
For a love so right, for all of my life

Ooh
I could love you so divine
Ooh baby
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you so divine
Both me and you

Ooh baby
I could love you so divine
Let me tell you
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you so
I could love you so divine

Ooh baby
I could love you so divine
Let me tell you
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I could love you so divine
Both me and you"

You've got to bite that food, got to bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you.
You better try diet before it's too late,
or I'll remove your excess weight with a potato peeler.
You've got to bite that food, you've got to bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you.
Bite that bun, bite that pie,
you gotta drink that shake before you die.
You've got to bite that food, bite that food
You've gotta get it inside you

You said that you felt weak, with me you were strong
You were sure you'd finally found the way
That makes you the fool who walked away

CHORUS
It took two to find the love you buried deep inside
And it took two to promise we would never let it die
Yes, it took two and you know it doesn't seem right
It just takes one to say goodbye

I was tired of making deals and just getting burned
It was different this time, æ¶ause you said you'd learned
To say words that you could never say
But the thing you still know best is running away

CHORUS

When the years go by, you'll see you don't have enough
But just remember you gave up when the going got rough
And you thought that it would set you free
But it's true love that you trade can't you see

It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion

Follow your emotions anywhere
Is it really magic in the air?
Never let your feelings get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
It's just an illusion, illusion, illusion

Could it be that it's just an illusion?
Putting me back in all this confusion?
Could it be that it's just an illusion now?
Could it be that it's just an illusion?
Putting me back in all this confusion?
Could it be that it's just an illusion now?
Could it be a picture in my mind?

Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone

Met de benenwagen hier op an

In de warme zweit en de alcoholdamp
De band loeit op zien allerhardst

Love my way, it's a new road
I follow where my mind goes

They'd put us on a railroad
They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces
And making it our way
There's emptiness behind their eyes
There's dust in all their hearts
They just want to steal us all 
And take us all apart
But not in

Apathy is all you preach
The strings of the puppet are out of reach
Ignore it, it might go away
Your at the bottom, that's where you'll stay
You just sit around and get stoned
There's no action, you only moan
Happily waving your white flag
Giving your leaders the last laugh

Left me at the bottom
You thought i'd work for them
Thought i was a joke
I got them in the end
Clawing from the outside
I couldn't leave my mark
Your inside hurts much more
The blood's under my nails

With ego-tripping acid punks
I giggled in a corner
A funeral in '78
I was the only mourner"

I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Going wherever you take me
Don't know why I put up with the pain
'Cause no one else can make me

You've got me going - stoned out of my mind

And when you led me to the waters I drank it
But I drank more than I could hold
And you took my mind off my body
And now you want to take my soul

Where can I run?
Where can I hide?
Who can I talk to?
Tell me what more can I do?

You've got me going - stoned out of my mind

Playing around with every guy in town
It's funny I just can't put you down
See my head - it's spinning around
Since the day you let me down"

Oh, don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Oh don't the moon look lonesome shinin' thru the trees?
Don't your arms look lonesome when your baby back's up  to leave?

Well i'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 
Said i'm goin' up on the mountain  to call that baby of mine 
But something tells me he's not coming back this time


We would like to go to the country-- baby can't take you
I'm goin' up  to the country -- baby can't take you
There's nothin' up there a man like you could do

He's got a face like a fish
Shape like a frog
When he loves me I holler uuuuuh-uhhh, hot dog

I love that man better than I do myself
I love that man better than I do myself
But i'm all alone, all alone on the shelf, on the shelf"
19,Rikk Agnew,One Shot,TRWEWPA12903CCEA63,1982,"Cut off my family so did you.
No one around except we two,
Free as the wind or river running.

There is no confusion,
No easy or hard ways,
There is just seclusion,
One shot and we're on our way.

We're always hand in hand
We sport libidos, heavy in demand.
What with the grups know, they'll never understand
Out fate.

[Chorus]
Internal damage done,
With no solution, insufficient funds,
Too soon you'll show, too soon you'll have to run.
Away.

Because, because no one we can trust,
Because, because, this world is not just.
Because, they say that three is a crowd,
No elder present beaming over proud.
Just one shot and we can be above the clouds.
So free.

[Chorus]

Because, because no one can we trust,
Because, because, this world is not just.
(take my hand and come with me
And then you'll see we're free)"

There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance

Is our ribbon in the sky for our love,love

We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I

27,Manowar,Dark Avenger,TRAJDAG128F145ACFB,1982,"He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eyes,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
sees his lifeblood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
""Let you not pass
Abandon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged""
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fearsome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness...
Save for his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder !
Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land nor servants
My wake is sloathe and there
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get their lives
But when I'm through they know they must pay
Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives"

As they were dancing in the evening
And the light shone through the trees

Asked the band to play her a beat

Singin' she'd do that long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Ohhh your heart
Now my heart will burst
Oh no

Ah, but it took me back to that wonderland
I witnessed long ago
Babbling words of preachers
Sayin'- ""Don't bury me no more""

Ohh...

And I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be won!

We dance

Long time jerk
She did it to me first
Ohhh my heart
With that long time jerk

Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk.

Bring on those tapes from the past
They make you look better in a mirror
Feel that long time jerkin'
Between the taker and the giver

Feel that...

Long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Oh I felt my heart
Now my heart will burst

I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be fun!

Oh, through lanes and streets and houses
And reversing rush of time
She made me re-invent the world
Before inventing time

And I wished I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage
And what's in store after their honeymoon
And I was grumbling to the dancers 
About how men and women ought to live apart
And how a promise never made can not be broken 
And can never break a heart

Then suddenly, from out of nowhere
A little girl came dancing cross the floor
And all her crinolines were billowin' 
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore
And oh, what a joy fell on the honored guests
As each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands
And hollered at her, dance little Jean

And they said, dance little Jean. this day is for you
Two people you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had
Was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad

Well, my cynical heart just melted
'Cause I figured what this get-together meant
How it ended years of tears and sad confusion 
That little girl had spent
And they told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake
But we played as long as they stayed
For love and laughs and little Jeanie's sake

And we played dance little Jean, this day is for you
Two people you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had
Was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad

Push a blade into my hands
Slowly up the stairs
And into the room, is it always like this?
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin

Her legs around me, in the morning I cried

Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk, we never smile, I scream ""You're nothing""
""I don't need you anymore, you're nothing""

Realisation gradually dawning
A man in a grey suit whispered 'I'm calling'
Pack up and drive away, away

Chained like a dog she had to rid
No point in coping off came the lid
Pack up and drive away, away
Pack up and drive away

Three thousand miles of honesty dreaming
Perfect imagery is gleaming
No more shattered clouds were deeming
Pack up and drive away, away
Pack up and drive away

In her heart it wasn't easy
Mumbled words and feeling dizzy
Reasons fight against excuses
Mothers have their ways and uses
Driving slowly she was losing
Dream was stirring only dozing
Eyelids awaken to the daytime
Just an illusion broken sunshine
Woman of thirty there's no choice
I can't hear your helpless voice"

Somewhere far off the thunder roaring
And the fortune teller has fixed her sleepy eyes on my child

To let the wind blow in my face
Sometimes I leave my cares lying in piles

Somewhat disturbing is the sound of birds singing
When you know you don't deserve it
You are not here today
And I feel just like an empty eggshell, and
My yoke is heavy
My yoke is heavy

My voice is a little horse
Galloping lost through the woods
Calling your name

It's new to me
But just the same
The earth is an old canvas
Painted over many times

The poet rambles
The world it scrambles
But who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men

Your shadow knows
It's right behind you all the way
Your shadow knows where you've been

Somewhat disturbing is the sound of birds singing
When you know you don't deserve it
You are not here today
And I feel just like an empty eggshell, and
My yoke is heavy
My yoke is heavy

Sacred is the smile
That opened up my mind
That may at last please save me
And rid my cold, cold heart
Of the dark deep gloom
That took up so much room
In my many spacious memories

And many are the times
I thought and rethought
The thoughts you got me thinking

Though the sun shines bright upon me now
And I am young and kicking
My yoke is heavy
My yoke is heavy"

Go out and get him
If you want him to be
Always by your side
If you want him to
Only think of you

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him tell him tell him tell him right now

Ever since the world began
It's been that way for men
And women were created
To make love their destiny
They why should true love be
So complicated oh

I know something about love
You've gotta take him
And show him what the world is made of
One kiss could prove it

If you want him to be
Always by your side
Take his hand tonight
Swallow your foolish pride

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him tell him tell him tell him right now"

Oh, I'm living in the future
I feel wonderful
I'm tipping over backwards

To see the things you've only ever heard of
Dream life the way you think it ought to be
See things you thought you'd never ever see

Take a cruise to China or a train to Spain
Go round the world again and again
Meet a girl on a boat meet a boy on a train
And fall in love without the pain

Everybody needs love and adventure
Everybody needs cash to spend
Everybody needs love and affection
Everybody needs two or three friends

[Chorus]
These are the things
These are the things
The things that dreams are made of
These are the things
These are the things
The things that dreams are made of

Take a lift to the top of the Empire State
Take a drive across the Golden Gate
March, march, march across Red Square
Do all the things you've ever dared

Everybody needs love and adventure
Everybody needs cash to spend
Everybody needs love and affection
Everybody needs two or three friends

[Chorus]

Like fun and money and food and love
And things you never thought of

These are the things
These are the things
The things that dreams are made of

New York, ice cream, TV, travel, good times
Norman Wisdom, Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, good times

And it's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes
Are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

It's not the things you say
It's not the things you do

Our hearts, an interest

Expanding with the funk

She sticks close to her friends

She is the Indian

Her hair the plaited vine  
I will be climbing

By friends who really would  
But say they wouldn't  
The joke's against my heart  
Immediately she's barred  
Their hearts are wooden

Into the distance

Cool and collected

If you’re in her territory
You know you’re fair game
Scratch and claw all over your face
She’s playing for keeps, oh no
You better get away

Searchin’ for a victim

Hold out, watch out
Just stay away
She’s gonna hurt you
Then leave you to waste
Watch out, jump back

No tears, no sorrow, no reasons, it's over

And stayed another hour

And teach you how to cry

Makes me lonely too

In a different place

62,John Cooper Clarke,The New Assassin,TRSDIBN128F425A0FF,1982,"Skip the roadblock here she comes
Get a load of the pretty blue gun
Any slick trick under the sun
She'll do it if it isn't done
She made arrangements she couldn't come
She dresses like a secretary and lives like a nun
Your crime is the radiant passion
It's time for the new assassin

Cool killer top of the class
The other side of the shatterproof glass
Works as fast as the cameras flash
With the cyanide cigarettes and the cs gas
It's her job - doesn't bat an eyelash
She's working for the perishing mass
The breadline's back in fashion
It's time for the new assassin

A melody played on a hand grenade
From the rifle range in the green arcade
As the rain fell down on the big parade
Messed up the motorcade - mucked up the masquerade
Secret weapons become displayed
In the hands of half a dozen aides
Just four men and a couple of gay blades
Shantung suits and shatterproof shades
Shoot up anybody who happens to be passing
Everybody but the new assassin

One link in the human chain
In the city where it always rains
No profit or personal gain
Are the silent rules in a lonesome game
One face in a purple frame
A black border round the name
Chalk marks around a blood stain
Thin blue line red light flashing
It's time for the new assassin
What time did you see it happen
It's time for the new assassin"

In the spotlight with the music playing loud

No distraction together we have found.
Let me show you all the glamour and the gold
Secret fantasies in a show biz world.
Music and lights - I'll sing and dance for you all night

Sequins and pearls and lots of pretty girls

You got to have rhythm.
When ever you're dancing and you glide across the floor

Your heart is singing and they're calling out for more

Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me, meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark, waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything? She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me round, just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance, under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger, thrashing in the water, thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years"

I fell in to that burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames they went higher

The taste of love is sweet  when hearts like I always meet
I fell for you like a child, oh and flames got wild.

I fell in to that burning ring of fire

Do they think we're so stupid, so useless and dumb

Sitting on a park bench in the autumn
Holding hands under a cloudless sky
Happiness is knowing you care for someone
And never having to give a reasons why
For love is never having to say anything
My love is yours to keep till the day you die

If I could write poetry
I would write a thousand poems
To tell the world that I love you

Dreaming we would always be together
Chasing rainbows in a happy sky
Thinking we would always be together
But now I find there's no tears left to cry
If I could catch a falling star I'd give it to you
Even though it's never been done before
And now I'm on a park bench in the autumn


I watch the rainbow disappear from view

If I could write poetry
I would write a thousand poems
To tell the world that I love you

Thinking all the time we spent together
All the love I had I gave to you
Sitting on a park bench in the autumn
Holding hands under a cloudless sky
Dreaming we would always be together
Thinking we would always be together
Hoping we would always be together
But the rainbow disappeared from view

Or anything that close

Hey!

How is the air up there
How is the air up there
How is the air up there
According to you I just don't care
I'm falling on the ground

First time that you saw me
Said you'd hope I would change
Well, your friends took one look at me
And they sure acted strange

Haven't seen you in a month
And you wonder what it's all about
Well, next time I'm in prison, love
Come and, well bail me out

And everyday I'll pass and say

You've got a lot of nerve
You say you're so lonely, well
It's all that you deserve

When you get tired of your
Love of life in high society
Well, get some kicks and take a trip
And come on down with me

And everyday I'll pass and say

The rusty stream of dawn completes
The scenes where cars once crawled these streets
A face against the moving sky
Brings back an alien hope
Just like they said to me
Keep your heart inside your coat


Well there's muddy shoes outside your door
Is anybody home I ask once more
A silver-plated jet comes home
But the map leads her astray
Just like they said to me
Find your heart and lose your way


A fire burns inside me
The snow still falls in flakes
The reins around a horse's throat
Turn into a lake
And people so familiar
Their words are in my mind

A fire burns inside me
Dancing cool and blind

Beside the wall the flowers grow
And down the sticky stems I go
Watching changing skies below
Your arms so far away
Just like they said to me
Life is worth another stay"

No such thing as a promised land
Don't lose faith in a better life
Reincarnation, poor excuse

You're dying you assholes, your religion can't help you now
Dying and starving in the fields you used to plow

Rotting bones in your barren fields
Worshipped creature's supposed to heal
He won't save you and he won't save me
See what you want to see

Hindu religion in the mind of a working Joe
Starving and dying in the fields you used to know

You're tied and bound to a God's useless advice
Bloated stomachs from aching diseases hold back the fight
In the end you'll return once more to die again
Go on till you can't no more in non-eternal sin"

Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh, the open sky shone most magnificent 
As if it was acting as her body's guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs, the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on, thus obstructing her last trip

And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from God's thoughts
First with her face, then her hands, right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpse"

Dos golpes de estado en irán

Raptando a un ministro,
Encuentran pertróleo en el mar

Pasas otra hoja, siguen con sus luchas
Ya no lo pueden parar
Baja la peseta, se mantiene el dólar
Sube el paro y la inflacción
Más asesinatos, más golpes de estado
Más invictos para ganar

Sally called, when she got the word,
She said 'I suppose you've heard about Alice.'
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
A big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive.

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know,
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice.
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice.

We grew up together, two kids in the park,
Carved our initials deep in the bark...
Me and Alice.
Now she walks to the door with her head held high,
And just for a moment, I caught her eye,
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive.

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know,
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice.
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice.

Then Sally called back, and asked how I felt,
She said 'I know how to help get over Alice.'
She said 'Now, Alice is gone, but I'm still here.
And you know I've been waiting twenty four years...'
And the big limousine disappeared...

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know,
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice.
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance,
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice.

But to you it is not a high price
To have your hair shiny and bright
To have your eyes stand out like a light
Four million animals die in experiments
Each year in Britain for what?
So vivisectors can gain praise and a wage
For prodding animals as their bodies distort

Don't think by turning your face the other way
All pain and suffering will just go away

Eighty-eight percent of your experiments
Are done with the use of no anesthetic
But now you've put it's eyes in a bowl
He thinks the animal has been stunned
At the expense of animals' lives
Man has tested and discovered new drugs
But has also destroyed animals eyes
Just so we can live our convenient lives
It's up to you
If you think man is justified
But just save a thought for the animals
That have died in pain for you

Don't think by turning you face the other way
All pain and suffering will just go away

Don't be blinded by scientists
Like so many animals have been
If you think this cruelty is wrong
Protest against it happening
You don't have to use products
That contain animal abuse
There are many many alternatives
Go and have a look

Don't think by turning your face the other way
All pain and suffering will just go away"

I fall sometimes.
It's hard to walk on shifting sand.
I miss the rock, and find there's nowhere left to stand;
I start to cry.
Lord, please help me raise my hands so You can pick me up.
Hold me close,
Hold me tighter.

I have found a place where I can hide.
It's safe inside
Your arms of love.
Like a child who's helped throughout a storm,
You keep me warm
In Your arms of love.

Storms will come and storms will go.
Wonder just how many storms it takes until
I finally know
You're here always.
Even when my skies are far from gray,
I can stay;
Teach me to stay there,

In the place I've found where I can hide.
It's safe inside

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one

Ja koirien haukuntaa
En jaksanut lypsää lehmää

Navetan piika kikattaa liikaa
Ja nukahtaa heti
Jos ei sitä kutiteta

Minä valvoin aamuun asti
Ullakkokamarissa
Ja katselin putkeni läpi
Punaista planeettaa

Otin käskyjä vastaan kaukaa
Viisailta olennoilta
Jotka käyttävät vaivattomasti
Valtavaa energiaa

Minä painoin mieleeni kaiken
Unessa opetetun
Alusten aikataulut
Reitit ja asemat
Baarit ja käyntikortit
Tullit ja valuutat
Eno hyvä meitä kutsuu

Jodoladi jodolaiduu

Vaikene kaikesta tästä ja pakkaa tavarasi

You pray for daylight to save you for a while.
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile.

Dead men - tell no tales,
In Gangland - murder's up for sale.
Dead men - tell no tales,
In Gangland - where the jailbirds die.

Face at the window leers into your own.
But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones.
How long can you hide? How long 'til they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive.

Once you were glad to be free for a while.
The air tasted good and the world was your friend.
Then came the day when the hard times began.
Now you're alone but alive for how long?

A knife at your throat, another body on the pile.
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile.
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain.
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail.

Dead men - tell no tales,
In Gangland - murder's up for sale.
Dead men - tell no tales,
In Gangland - where the jailbirds die.

Give, give it to me it won't get abused

Think what to do.
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.
Tonight I lost sight of all purpose
Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between . . .
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here. . .
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish
my body, until I believe in my soul."

With their non sexist haircuts, dirty feet 
Their dogs, cats, political elite

Furnishing their houses from the contents of skips 
Things that decent people put on rubbish tips 
They look quite harmless sitting out in the sun 
But I wouldn't let my daughter marry one

Dirty squatters 
Oh my god they're moving in next door 
Dirty squatters 
Is it for people like this that Winston won - the war

I've lives in this street for nearly fifteen years 
Lived here with my hopes, lived here with my fears 
Paid my taxes, paid my bills 
Watched my money vanished in the council tills 
Alone come these scruffs with their education 
Their grand ideas, talk of corruption 
My rent keeps rising, my job gets boring 
If things gets worse then I'm gonna have to join them

Dirty squatters 
Oh my god they're moving in next door 
Dirty squatters 
Is it for people like this that Winston won - the war

Bought myself a lock and late tonight 
Under the cover of darkness if the moons not bright 
Getting out of here, moving in next door

A motorway intersection
Exhaust pipes at pram level
Now playgrounds are carparks

Their feet hardly ever touch the ground

Hold on to precious breath you're homeward bound

I've got to breathe, lead free
Breathe, lead free

Wheels keep rolling round and round
Their feet hardly ever touch the ground
The tiger in the tank is a vile compound
Hold on to precious breath you're homeward bound

I've got to breathe, high octane
Oh, oh, high octane

Wheels of Fortune keep rolling on

Bullets richochet just above my head
In a hole in the ground I make my bed
Wake up in the morning and find me dead
Load up my weapon and pump them full of lead"

So hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires
When you dream flat tires?

With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious
When first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires
You dream flat tires

""Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs""
Are you telling me that to tease me?
Or just to hear me beg
""Please don't go!""

Cause I know that you love me
But, when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious
When first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires
They dream flat tires

Only just the rain makes the skin feel colder
All my life seems so far away

Tears and loss feed the overgrown grass
And I have to leave, but I never seem to go
Only more sad clouds where autumn winds will blow
All my dreams seem so long ago
Oh, Field of Mars
Time is past in the Field of Mars

And I call her name, but she never, ever hears
And I call again to the cruelty of the years

Vi que sem você não há caminho

Quando o meu mundo era mais mundo
E todo mundo admitia
Uma mudança muito estranha
Mais pureza, mais carinho
Mais calma, mais alegria
No meu jeito de me dar
Quando a cançao se fez mais clara
E mais sentida
Quando a poesia realmente fez folia em minha vida
Você veio me falar dessa paixão inesperada
Por outra pessoa

Mas não tem revolta, não
Só quero que você se encontre
Saudade até que é bom
É melhor que caminhar vazio
A esperança é um dom
Que eu tenho em mim
Eu tenho, sim
Não tem desespero, não
Você me ensinou milhões de coisas
Tenho um sonho em minhas mãos
Amanhã será um novo dia
Certamente eu vou ser mais feliz

Whisper the words I need to know speak to me that way tonight
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you
Come to me today

aqui la frustración, la piel, las ganas 
aqui seras payaso y domadór 
aqui seras el juez y el perdedór
aqui se invertiran los roles 
para usted
Usted que esta alli 
nosotros arriba 
la calle, el escenario 
digamos mejor 
que es necesario 
actuar para vivir 
Y en un fatal primer acto nacemos 
cambiando siempre el vestuario y el juego 
siempre tras la emoción 
que es el sueldo esencial 
siempre tras la noche 
y las mesas de café 
jaqueamos la inteligencia como peón al rey
jaqueamos la inteligencia. la hacemos canción. 

Toda esa magia escondida 
la de los altos telones 
no es nada mas que un anhelo de dos 
la gente, el actor 
las ganas de verse ahi 
Se escuchó el ultimo aplauso 
se fueron todas las luces 
quedaron solo fantasmas de ayer 
sin nombre, sin tez 
mañana quizas este el mio."

We ain't simple, we aint fools

Another dawn, another day
They want homes to call their own
The rules are different, the games the same
People don't understand me
'Cause i play in a rock &amp; roll band

We run in different games
But we all feel just the same

They don't know my name

I stand naked on the street
I scream 'til I'm blue

Love happened easily and dreams never died
Life sung a pretty song, now those days are gone

Crying, finding comfort in the friends we knew
Now it's just me and you trying alone
We used to get along (we used to) now those days are gone

Playing with words when there's nothing much to say
Searching to find what we lost along the way
Could it be one day our feelings changed
I hope we see it through 'cause I just can't stand the thought
Of life without you

Dreaming, whispers echo on the summer wind
Back where the love begins, when nights were so warm
With stars we could wish upon, now those days are gone

We had a chance but we lost it all somehow
Broken the spell and our dreams lie heavy now
Could it be some day our feelings changed
I hope we see it though 'cause I just can't stand the thought
Of life without you

Thinking, long ago when we were young and free
Love happened suddenly and we couldn't see
Where we were going wrong, now those days are gone."

Old men crying, deny their ruin
Watch them try
The cynic laughs at the optimist's closed eyes

Darkness falls, curtain calls, the cynic's beer soon overflows
Other watches, has a seat, and from the same cup, they drink
I'm doing time, how long I don't know

William had 26
Blew his brains out, now look at him
John had only one
Watch the mother mourn her only son

I'm doing time, how long I don't know
I'll kiss goodbye my brain and body
And go to sleep for generations
And go to sleep for generations

Salvation
Cease concentration
You'll only lose the fight
Don't tell me what's wrong or right
You're losing sight
You're just gonna die anyway"
132,Dan Fogelberg,The Power Of Gold,TRIPKBD128F931D128,1982,"The story is told of the
Power of gold
And its lure on the unsuspecting
It glitters and shines
It badgers and blinds
And constantly needs protecting.

Balance the cost of the soul you lost
With the dreams you lightly sold
Are you under 
The power of gold?

The letters and calls
Got you climbing the walls
And everyone wants a favor
They beg to remind you
Of times left behind you
But you know the past is a loser.

The face you're wearing is different now
And the days run hot and cold
Are you under
The power of gold?

You're a creature of habit
Run like a rabbit
Scared of a fear you can't name
Your own paranoia
Is looming before you
But nobody thinks that
It's a game.

Balance the cost of the soul you lost
With the dreams you lightly sold
Then tell me
That you're free
Of the power of gold.

The women are lovely
The wine is superb
But there's something about the song
That disturbs you..."

You made my head spin
And it's never stopped

Never, never before
Never, never again

I was your clown
I was your dog
It's too bad it had to end
And though it did
It sure was fun
My love for you will outlast the sun

Never, never before

Behind every sad man there's a great woman

Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look, then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched, I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back, how did I exist?
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine

Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
Baby, love is here and now there's

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine

On the wings of love, only the two of us
Together flying high, flying high upon the wings of love

You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
And I'm crazy 'bout ya, baby, can't you see
I'd be so delighted if you would come with me

On the wings of love, up and above the clouds
The only way to fly is on the wings of love

Running free travelling on the wings of love

Fills the room with mystery

That protected seal of love  
Broken by the flame of fun  
Lying back with Exodus  
In the arms of lovers' trust

From the curtain broken night  
Shadows fall on mystery

Stubbing out the cigarette  
I see the clothes beside the bed  
As the half light of the day  
Pulls the sheet up once again

When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay

And when the rain is beatin' upon the window pane
And when the night, it gets so cold, when I can't sleep
Again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it
With a word you dry my tears

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know
You're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay

And if I wanted to
I could never be free
I never believed it was so true
But now it's so clear to me

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire

New attitudes, brand new stance 
Different steps but the same old dance 
New ways but in the end 
It's a new way to make you spend

The media cares cause the media knows 
Fashions comes and fashions go 
Last week trend is now passe 
Cause there's something better to buy today 
You can buy something and leave it at that 
But you go and try to take it back 
They'll offer you nothing though it cost the Earth 
Soon show you what they think your worth

And there's a new band every week 
New ways to move your feet 
New ways but in the end 
It's a new way to make you spend

Been searching for some thing but I don't know what, been searching for a long long time 
Then someone comes along and says ""this is it"", but it will cost you, realize 
You pay your money, try your luck, think your trust them one more time 
But how long does it take to feel your being ripped off, there's always something new buy

There's a new band every week

New ways but in the end

Rising above the factories and the fields
Now, ever since I was a child I can remember
That mansion on the hill

In the day, you can see the children playing
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel
Steel gates that completely surround, sir 
The mansion on the hill

At night, my daddy'd take me and we'd ride 
Through the streets of a town so silent and still
Park on a back road along the highway side
Look up at that mansion on the hill

In the summer, all the lights would shine 
There'd be music playing, people laughing all the time
Me and my sister we'd hide out in the tall corn fields
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

Tonight, down here in Linden town 
I watch the cars rushing by home from the mill
There's a beautiful full moon rising 
Above the mansion on the hill"

Until you're gone forever,

A place where nobody knows

The sound of gunfire, off in the distance

I've lived all over this town

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now

Transmit the message, to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, a couple of visas
You don't even know my real name

High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home

This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no Mudd Club, or C.B.G.B.

Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, PA?

Somebody see you up there

I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play

Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got time for that now

Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that that ain't allowed

We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle, so many times now
I don't know what I look like

You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep

Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive

Get your instructions, follow directions
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
Whatever you think is best

Don't want to catch no disease
Try to be careful, don't take no chances

That when you need me I'll be right there

And I just want you to know
How much you mean

That it's more than just a feeling passing through my heart
'Cause every time you're near I start to lose control
I can't wait until I hold you, 'cause I'm longing for

Of children she had three,
She sent them away to the North Countree
To learn their grammaree

They'd not been gone but a very short time,
Scarcely three weeks and a day,
When death, cruel death, came hasting along
And stole those babes away.

""There is a King in Heaven,"" she cried
""A King of third degree
Send back, send back my three little pages,
This night send them back to me.""

She made a bed in the uppermost room,
On it she put a white sheet,
And over the top a golden spread
That they much better might sleep.

""Take it off, take it off,"" cried the older one,
""Take it off, take it off,"" cried he,
""For what's to become of this wide wicked world
Since sin has first begun.""

She set a table of linen fine,
On it she placed bread and wine,
""Come eat, come drink of mine.""

""We want none of your bread, mother,
Neither do we want your wine,
For yonder stands our Savior deer,
To Him we must resign.""

""Green grass is over our heads, mother,
Cold clay is over our feet,
And every tear you shed for us,
It wets our winding-sheet."""

I say we've proved them wrong without a doubt
I can't remember now just what we said
I never could have guessed what lay ahead
As I ran towards you up the stairs
Did a voice in my ear cry, ""Beware""?

Even now I'm surprised you recall
Such a short time it took me to fall
Pretending that my heart still lay elsewhere
When in truth I had long ceased to care
For what I thought I'd never replace
'Til in my heart you left him no space

You say, you wonder what was it I saw?
I say ""Oh, I don't recall anymore""
My first impressions have been left behind
Replaced now by feelings and more lost in kind

Sure that you know but you never can tell
When I think I understand you so well
Shakes me that you were a constant surprise
Or so you appear in my eyes

Tempting to think now it will all be plain sailing
Old enough now to know there's no such thing"

I went to see my friend to ask his advice
He just smiled and said, ""She's good around the eyes""

To let nothing come between us

There are frustrated people in town
Who might envy us and want to bring us down
We know they don't really mean any harm
But that doesn't mean we've gotta let 'em hang around

Got the license, got the ring
Got back the blood tests and everything
Putting on my boutonniere it's her favorite flower
Then I'm walking down the altar and I'm gonna take the vow

Don't let nothing come between you, hey!

We crossed the state line
It was more than just an overdraft
We were looking at time

If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer, no

We had to leave in a hurry now
No time to hesitate
It was worse than misunderstanding
I had to ask her not to call it fate

If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer

Yeah!

No one sleeps on the yellow line
No one's that alone
Someone's in the window
So don't try to use the phone

We're just up against it
We turned up in the zone
But if you ever get an overdraft
You'll never make it home

If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer
If I do say so, I can't let go
And I don't take no for an answer, ha

I've been reading more and looking up the hard words 
I met people who get me on the guest list 
My parents said that they would help me 
Pay for grad school 

You know I, I never washed this sweater 
I never knew when my hair was too long 
I got the cat balls out of the hi-fi

I fixed the toilet so it doesn't always run
I moved a chair over by the window 
I feel better if my laundry's done

Getting by on less sleep than I used to 
I had no trouble in setting up a desk 
I learned the reason for a three-pronged outlet 
I got 100 on my driver's test 

I got a trick to get them to deliver 
I called the landlord when the water turned brown 
Did you know I own some valuable records?

Till you're livin' in a world that's ruled by fear

Always takin' baby out, that's okay
What they're givin', maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow, kicked in the face

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter

As the sweat is running down your neck
All your praying for is to stop your body breakin' up
Oh your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straightjacket, gotta break that line
Everyone who makes it in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake

I don't talk about it but that's alright
Tables turned, now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever babe, I tell ya, I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

Now we're screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Screaming
Screaming vengeance
Screaming vengeance

nunca tuvo un hijo, nunca una mujer 
se pasaba el día en la oficina 
llevando papeles, sirviendo café 
su refugio una pension muy vieja, 
llena de fantasmas y restos de pan 
su amigo un gato que habló con él. 
Nunca nadie le ofreció motives 
como para estar, como para hablar 
nunca nadie le ofreció su casa 
para que no pase solo Navidad

lo encontraba a veces en la seccional

de a pedazos, de a pedazos cae quieto. 
Casi siempre a las seis menos cuarto 
cuando el sol despierta en el andén 
levantaba su cuerpo chiquito 
se afeitaba y contaba hasta cien 
como para recordar que estaba 
tan despierto como vos y yo 
con todas esas ganas de andar. 
Una noche en un bar de esos tantos 
se bebió hasta el ultimo rincón 
decidió que su piél era carne 
y su alma tán solo un motor 
y se gastó de golpe una copa 
y se hastió del pan y la pensión 
quizás la muerte sea mejor. 
Se subió al primer taxi 
conla impotencia en quiebra 
la ltima noche que estaré conmigo 
será una gran fiesta, dijo, 
plena de estrellas. 
Se levantó temprano 
desayuno en silencio 
miró el reloj que lo observaba tenso 
y en la cuerda floja, volvió a pensarlo.

cerró los ojos, no dudó un instante 
y apretó la carne sangró su pecho."

You'll accept the blade!

You know you're not alone
You know it's gonna end this way

It goes into your side
The blackness comes, tonight's the night

'Cause you're under the blade,

It's not another party head
This time you cannot rise
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped
A light shines in your eyes
You faintly see a razor's edge
You open your mouth to cry
You know you can't, it's over now

Shaved my wild imaginings

Each morning was a melody
Simple words and harmony
And you are all my eyes could wish to see

And after standing there
Silently you walked and wave
Leaving me with yesterday

And we'll pretend again
Trying to convince ourselves

Maybe they'd become sensitive

It seemed so easy
I could have your beauty for free
When time decides to take this pain away
We'll find our freedom again

Silti salaisesti häntä silloin rakastin,
ja suutelin illoin luona sakastin
vaan ei kosinnallein kallistanut korvaa,
siispä kallistelin koskenkorvaa

Kun viina vatsasta päähän ehtii,
munuaiset soi ja perna parkaisee
korkeampi äly talvehtii,
se maksan karkaisee

Sitten kerran viinalastissa lähdettiin retkelle reippaalle
ryyppäämään ja solvaamaan hihhulijuhliin Pohjanmaalle 
siellä oltiin aivan sekaisin, horjuin yhteen telttaan
jossa Jeesus puhu äänin taivaisin, se meni suoraan helttaan

Tulin uskoon ja ostin kitaran,
nain Miinan ja saimme kakaran
nyt olen rokkipastori,
koska Jeesus oli punkkari

Perfume de aventura inundando o ar de emoção e calor

Luxo e luxúria nas noites do oásis do amor
A caravana do delírio se perdeu de mim
Sozinho no deserto me senti feliz e cantei para o céu
Em plena miragem da luz no meio do dia"

You know you're always right 'cause you know how to prove it step by step
A PhD to show you're smart with textbook formulas
But you're used up just like a factory hand

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack

Company cocktails, gotta go say the right thing
Don't fidget, jockey for position
Be polite in the pyramid you hate
Sip that scotch, get that raise, this ain't no party at all

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack

Cringe and tense, grind your teeth
And wipe your sweaty palms
Close your windows driving past the low life company bar
They're making fun of you

Oh, even you
You've gotta punch the clock, why don't you punch your boss?
Oh, even you
You just punch the clock, too scared to punch your boss

When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you open your eyes, open your eyes, open your eyes?

Pull up to your sterile home, you're drained
Bite the heads off all your kids
Chew them well, they taste like you
Just slam the door

Assigned here 'cause your company owns the land
All your colleagues live here too
Private guards in golf carts
Keep you safe at home

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack

When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?

The dark shattered underbelly
Of the American dream
Avoid it like the plague
It stares you from your bathroom mirror

Drown!"

I'd like to take her home that's understood
She plays hard to get, she smiles from time to time
It only takes a camera to change her mind
 
She's going out tonight but drinking just champagne
And she has been checking nearly all the men
She's playing her game and you can hear them say
She is looking good, for beauty we will pay
 
She's posing for consumer products now and then
For every camera she gives the best she can
I saw her on the cover of a magazine
Now she's a big success, I want to meet her again"
212,The Chills,Rolling Moon,TRUWCFL128F4227724,1982,"We wander lost forgotten hills
Blue sky, green grass, we are still
The mists enfold us gently smelling
Breeze in our ears softly telling
of the days of light and laughter long ago
They trace us, taste us, touch our hair
Show us a castle and show us to their lair - to their lair
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home.
It's pretty cool but we can't rest
The purple sun sets in the west
We prance on gold - red summer lawns
Dragons-blood evening, the buzz of swarms
of lawnmowers mowing summer lawns away, far away,
I realise we really are quite far away, far away,
far away, far away
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones

Please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home"

Is she really going out with him?
He's not her type
And doing all the things she used to do to me

Well, I'd say something to her, but I get so jealous
When I think of her loving somebody else
That I can't think why we ever let go
I must have been crazy

Tell me what kind of fool am I?
To just let go, to just let go like that
What kind of fool am I?
To lose you

She was cold sometimes, but she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby
But baby, she could love
And she loved me like nobody ever will again

I thought we'd be together, when the world ran down
When the curtain fell and the lights came up
But the gods or whatever make the world go round
Shuffled when they should have cut

Tell me what kind of fool am I?
To just let go, to just let go like that
What kind of fool am I?
To lose you

Did it come too easy to the two of us
Did we go too wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checking out the left hand
That we didn't see the right?

And tell me what kind of fool am I?
To just let go, to just let go like that
What kind of fool am I?
Oh baby, please, oh baby, please come back

I meant to say in time
Baby we could work it out
But I never meant to say goodbye

Tell me what kind of fool am I?
What kind of fool am I?
What kind of fool am I?
To lose you"

J'cherche un circuit pour que j'm'éclate

Je nage dans le goulag je rêve d'évasion
Caractériel je sais pas dire oui
Dans ma pauvre cervelle carton bouilli

Je m'acolyte trop avec moi-même
Je me colle au pare-brise ça me gêne

It was round about midnight. Hipster town. Imagine going for a walk.
Things get around to taking place. It's not a waste of time.
The rich got a little poorer.
Things get around to taking place if they're gonna happen at all.
Don't need that jazz. Don't need that stuff.

219,Ijahman Levi,Tell It To The Children,TRWFYYN128F92EC520,1982,"In this world
I've told so many sad stories
And seen sad pictures towards you and me
Even the books Lord
When I take a careful look
It was hard to believe what I read
So I went to hide to get some peace of mind
To know more about myself
When I'm face by the force
Back is against the wall identifying myself
I'm not now trying to make a public statement
I've been down down down more than once before
It is true I'm now an ambassador
Coming in the name of Jah telling it to the children

Tell it to the children Lord Rasta children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Rasta Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Jah Jah Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them

I'm the beginning
Although its a little bit translated
Written in prophecy by I and I wise man
I discover Lord of a fact I'm the true culture
Checking on my history that was hidden from me
I was taught to believe my only ability
Was swinging from tree to tree
Cause they always want to see the jungle half of me
Cause I'm from the monkey family
And that of all of the once greats
None was like the shade of the nights Lord
I was even taught to believe
That my God he too has blue eyes I say

Tell it to the children Lord Rasta children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Rasta Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Rasta Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them

Let's take for instance
The phisical of his imperial majesty
Emperor Haile Selassie I the first King of Kings
He who sitteth and reigneth
All nations bow when he was crowned
The Earth quake lightening and thunder showed signs and wonder
My true God and King to be seen touched by Him
I'm not dealing with any kind of painted picture
I bow before no statue worship lucky old sun
My God is not man made or animal
Revelation is revealing the book of prophecy has its meaning
For while the book of prophecy sometimes close
The spirit of man continues on it never folds.

Tell it to the children Lord Rasta children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Rasta Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Jah Jah Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them
Tell it to the children Lord Rasta Children
Don't let what was hidden from you and me be hidden from them"

The race of rodents on their feet across the global stage.

So you gotta go fast...

You're leaving me tomorrow first said you loved me yesterday,
I guess its common law within the citys lightning way.
My logics pretzeled to a twist, my logics gone astray,
So old i feel, its too for real the price for life we pay.

And you gotta go fast...
Faster faster faster faster

Too quick to think too soon to know, too G-Forced of a pace,

Let's go steady again like in the past
Let's show all of our friends that our love can last

Come on baby let's go steady again

Wednesday, I almost lost my mind

Never had a day sad as Saturday
Even Sunday was no fun day

It was hotter than fire

Took off in flight 
Oh no no...

Flashback something coming over me 
No sweat one time fantasy
Bare boned and all that is the wind it seems
Hell who's the chick
That rides into my dreams 

No livery 
No stable lights 
No try to please 
Nobody's eyes 
We'll never see us again 
In time it'll pass 
And where did it all begin
But all in good time
Somebody shot an arrow 

Now tell me tell me tell me tell me never 
Wakin' me 'cause you're cold somtimes 
Being seduced will be your own pleasures

All there is to perceive
Is what I want, and I know how to get it

Learn to tie knots
Take lots of Dramamine
Out on your yacht

But when you're all alone
And nothing bites
You'll wish you stayed at home
With someone nice

But when you think you made it disappear
It comes again, ""Hello, I'm here.""
And I've got angst in my pants

You can be smart as hell
Know how to add
Know how to figure things
On yellow pads

Answer so no one knows
What you just said
But when you're all alone
You and your head

What's the computer say, it's mumbling now
It says, ""Hey, Joe."" It's spelled it out
And you've got angst in your pants

I loved you like I'll never love another,
With the wild heart of the young
But it took until now to uncover.
Oh, if I'd only known it then

You spoke of the dream we made come true
I remember how I looked up to you.
It was there in your touch
You knew so much.

CHORUS

Well, they watched while you broke all the rules,
And everyone thought I was your fool.
But I paid the price
Never even thought twice

I knew I know they'd all fade except for you.
And someday you'll see how much you taught me."

funzionavano a valvole
e i bambini eravamo noi.

In un programma dalle sette
alle sette e venti,
andava in onda tutti i lunedì,
si intitolava se ricordo bene,
""Il discobolo"" o giù di lì.

Una musica tutta chitarra e batteria,
l'altoparlante faceva 'crok'
ed il più grande dei nostri amici
quelle canzoni le chiamava rock.

Se potessi questa sera
ascolterei volentieri
Rollo con i suoi Jets
e quel bassista mezzo messicano
soprannominato ""Chicco di caffè"".

E il chitarrista con quel nome strano
ma chi se lo dimentica più?
Con quel suo stile sudamericano,
ma che ogni tanto svisava blues.

Una musica tutta chitarra e batteria
con il rullante che faceva 'toc'
ed il più esperto dei nostri amici
quelle canzoni le chiamava rock.

Se potessi questa sera
ascolterei volentieri
Rollo, qualche novità,
è un po' di tempo che non si sentiva
ma questa sera
è ritornato qua.

Con un programma che ci porta
attraverso il mare,
fino all'America
e pure più in là,
le nere vele di una nave a vapore
da consegnare alla posterità.

When early man started the first civilization
And human aggression was born

I show pity on the future to come
When the government system will be omnipotent
And we'll be worse off
Than we are now

Pity, pity, on the billions of ignorant people
Pity, pity, on the masses of aggression
Pity, pity, on the future centuries to come

It's all a question, are we gonna last?
If we endure the aggression that's inside all of us
We'll wipe out our own species and thus

As the days become heavier and weighted, waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes, as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them and dust on the lips of a vision of Hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance, I think about tomorrow
Please let me sleep, as I slip down the window
Freshly squashed fly, you mean nothing
You mean nothing

I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right
Run into the night, I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain, my heart explodes
My memory in a fire
And someone will listen, at least for a short while

I can never say no, I can never say no to anyone but you

Too many secrets, too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets, please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me in sequence, in despair of time
I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes, pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again
Touch her eyes, press my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again

When I tried to turn away
To feel new again
My emotion cost me pain
Did I look the same
When I think about the times
That I laughed away the idea you'd cheat me
But look again
What do you say 'That's my name'

AND I HOPE THAT I'VE KEPT YOU AMUSED
TO WIPE THAT SPIT RIGHT OFF MY BOOTS
And when I'm home and thinking in the dark
I hope that none of this has had to go too far

On a wide dual road.
I might as well be walking
As to drive this old Ford.

Almost everyntime I try
To go and pass a truck,
If I ain't goin' down hill,
Dad, Im, out of luck.
And even if I get by,
It's still a rugged risk,
The way this old Ford
Keep a hitting and miss.

Last week when I was driving
On my way to school,
I almost got a ticket
'Bout a freeway traffic rule.
It's now a violation
Driving under forty-five,
And if I push to fifty,
This here Ford will nosedive.

Dad, I'm in great danger
Out here trying to drive.
This Ford wiggles
When I'm approaching forty-five/
I have to nurse it along
Like a little suffering pup,
And cars whizzing by me,
Dad, look like I'm backing up.

She just don't have the appetite
For gas somehow,
And Dad, I got both carburetors
Hooked up on it now.
I tried to hook another
To see if I'd do a little good,
But ain't no place to put it
'Less I perforate the hood.

So Dad, send the money,
See what I can see,
Try to find a Cadillac,
Sixty-two or three.
Just something that won't worry us
To keep it on the road.

Henry Junior Ford."

Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of the wall

Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right 

'Cos I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely
But hoping you could be strong
But can you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong? 

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away 

Well he's gonna try to make it work for you
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
Think about me, oh! and don't be fooled by his kiss

You got to get this complication out your head
Or find another man instead

You listen very close to what the bad girls said
In all those crumby articles and in my bed
They said I'm just a stripper not afraid to strip
I got my brains rattlin' my hips

Ok, Marco, let's hear what you can do

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

You've got the kind of looks
That make a dead man stare
But when it comes to working, honey
You ain't there
I try to tell you nicely but the screaming starts
You're playing ping pong with my heart

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country

se ha muerto mi niño, mi niño, mi niño,

No pudo llenarse la boca de voz, 
apenas vacio el vientre, 
de mi dulce amor. 
enorme y azul, la vida se le dió; 
no pudo tomarla, no pudo tomarla, 
de tan pequeño 

Yo le habia hecho una blanca canción 
de un amor entre una nube 
y un pez volador, lo soñe corriendo abrigado en sudór 
las mejillas llenas las mejillas llenas 
de sol y dulzór 
Era en abril el ritmo tibio 
de mi chiquito que danzaba 
dentro del vientre un prado en flor 
era su lecho y el ombligo 
y el ombligo el sol 
No busques hermano camino mejór 
que ya tengo el alma muda 
de decirle adios 
que hacemos ahora mi dulzura y yo 
con dos pechos llenos con dos pechos llenos 
de leche y dolor 
Era en abril el ritmo tibio 
de mi chiquito que danzaba

260,Battalion Of Saints,Fighting Boys,TRHDUUM128F933D516,1982,"Fighting heading off to war one more time to defend the nation
The modern warriors are out to kill with their brainwashed minds sitting in a chopper
They hover over the killing zone getting ready to land and start the attack
In the name of god and country they kill all life to get medals of glory

Fighting boys have no choice
But to Fight, Fight, Fight
Fighting boys go out in the streets
And go wild

Can't you see what's wrong with them - it's the middle class life they lead
They're too busy worrying about how cool they are to worry about the future
Most people in the states don't really know or care what's happening
So you'd better prepare for the draft - it's inevitable - no more good time

(Chorus)

While the soldier sits in a hole on foreign soil thinking of home girls
All he wants is to get out alive to see his home one more time
Most of America sits around watching TV not worrying about the fighting
All I know is that Americans they are so lazy and I hate them

(Chorus)

You wonder about the governments and why they have wars
It's because they really don't want us around"

Stood there like a knight in shining armor

Feels so good, I feel alive

tanti anni fa qui ci veniva con Maria.
Apri gli occhi amore
e lasciami guardare
c'e' freddo ma sciogli il gelo tutt'intorno
cosi in citta' noi non abbiamo mai cosato.
In macchina guardavo le tue gambe
sotto quella gonna calda chissa'
forse e' stato il vino di collina
o il vederti cosi' serena sara'
quel che sara' ma prendimi forte Maria.
In macchina guardavo..."

A hatbox full of drum

The things I said


You are the landscape
Of my dreams
Darlin' I beg your pardon

Lord knows what he's got in store
Everything is shaped by a cross
And you'd do as easy as the next one
 
Better open my eyes now
Everything at the door
Best keep my eyes closed

Lock me away, I need to unwind

From your window?

Listen, remembering with deep regret
How we used to dance in a discoteque
Ask me why I say dance to forget
My fall from grace, my losing face
These are the tears, the tears I can't hide
The pride inside, I can't deny
The hurt, the pain, all thrown out
My window

I trusted you

Listen I step
Down to the arcade
And I see my relection in the window
And I feign affection for that window
I could be kidding you on
I could be kidding you on and on...

And I see my reflection in the window
Come step down to the arcade

Screaming at the moon, another pastime

Oh I no hear
Too much for what some say
Cause at the close of the day
They'll be so far away
But then I know
One things for certain
Came at the closing of the
Woo oh oh oh
Yes, I know one thing for certain
You'll be there you'll be there
It was you
That raise the flag above I head
Once when I was once when I was
In a little situation
Came with a solution
Was a revelation to hear
Triumphant calling
Triumphant trumpets

To make I home
To make I home yeh

Looking for some aggro, just to pass the time
We met this stupid hippy and he tried to run away
But i punched him in the nose just to pass the time of day

[Chorus]
Great big boots, great long laces
Our jeans held up with scarlet braces
Get out of our way or get took for a ride
We've just got violence in our minds
Wake up in the morning, have me ready brek
Drink me cup of Bovril and wring my mothers neck
Strollinto town, beat a Soul Boy black and blue
Put a fruit gum in the meter cos there's fuck all else to do

Always get some bovver in, before the second half
We have our selve a smashing time, we really have some fun
Especially when the odds are ours 25 to 1, to 1"

A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone
Sunrise has gone

Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane

Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Sunrise has gone
Numbing our desires
Sunrise has gone
Sunrise has gone

Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it isn't only madmen who listen to fools
""Is this the end?"" the millions cried.
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm

Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be set free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun"

Little twitches people can't explain
Young bodies, listen to them talking
New languagism in their veins

Same face in a new situation
The mirror ball holds mesmerised -
He looks around, he's the new Clark Gable...

Don't wanna talk about -
Heartfelt urges - he get these urges

He move slowly she's a china doll
By degrees, he'll loosen her composure -
She knows he knows she knows he knows.
One word to the man in the pulpit
She start twitching and she can't sit still
Seven inches of a black star liner

Urges, urges...

Try to contain the stuff that's in your body
Bit silly when your head's no good
When you're ashamed of things about your body
You keep drinking like you knew you would
In the footlight the ape in motion
Spins circles all across the floor -
Mouth the words, assume the positions
For a second we can fool them all
Girl, this time it's a new sensation
It's never been this way before.
I look at you and I feel half human

Talk about you and me
How a fool fell out of love with you
Wanted to be free

Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
And left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say

I read your letter again
I'm sure you know the one
""Goodbye,"" you said like a coward
""It'll be better in the long run""

Well that's easy for you to say
That I don't know what I'm doing
That I've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin
That's easy for you to say

Go back to her again
Back to the way you were
She's a damn sight better for you
You're a damn sight better for her

That I don't know what I'm doing
When you've thrown our love away
Left my life in ruin

On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
And we were so gung-ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight

We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes, we would all go down together

Remember Charlie?
Remember Baker?
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day
In the palm of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night seemed to last as long as
Six weeks on Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp, as sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes, we would all go down together"

That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you

Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

Are said and done,
And nighttime finds you home,
Are you all right
To spend a night
Of being all alone?

And do you hide
Between the lines
Of conversations past?
A wall of words,
A heart unheard,
That hides behind a mask?

I'm raining on the inside;
My heart wells up with tears that start to pour.
I'm raining on the inside,
But then Your cries of love break through,
And I fall in love with You once more.

When friends who care
Can't be there
To ease away my pain,
And peace of mind,
It's hard to find,
Like sunlight in the rain.

God sees my heart,
The deepest part,
Inside this lonely me,
And reachin' in,
His love begins
To heal the heart in me.

I'm raining on the inside;
Oh, my heart weels up with tears that start to pour.
I'm raining on the inside,
But then Your cries of love break through,
And I fall in love with You once more.

Sometimes we're raining on the inside,
And our hearts well up with tears that start to pour.
But when we're raining on the inside,
Let His cries of love break through,
Know that He loves you, once more....

Sometimes I'm raining on the inside,
But then Your cries of love break through,
And I fall in love with You once more."

I'm not giving what I'm taking
So hurt...Deep inside
you say ther's nothin' to it
But my eyes are open wide
And I don't know why you do it
you say I cheated, you say that I lied
People tell ya I'm taking you for a ride
Oh but baby they lied...

Give you my love, I'll give you all of my time
Just to keep you satisfied
It's never enough until it's over the time
So you're livin' on the wild side
Undercover lovers late at night
Won't take the pain away...
Two wrongs don't make a right
But you wanna make me pay
I know, love can be real
You're not the only one whose got a bad deal
I know just how you, oh yeah
MISS Mistreated .. whose mistreatin' who...
You think it's me...I think it's you...yes I do
MISS Mistreated
MISS Mistreated
MISS Mistreated
MISS Mistreated

I wanna know...love can be real
You're not the only one whose got a bad deal
I know how you feel...ooh
MISS Mistreated...whose mistreatin who...
You think it's me...I think it's you...yes I do

MISS Mistreated...
MISS Mistreated...so wrong...
MISS Mistreated...
MISS Mistreated...
I never meant to hurt you baby
MISS Mistreated...
I never meant to hurt you baby
MISS Mistreated..."
321,Die Toten Hosen,Wir sind bereit,TRWMHZL128F932C2A0,1982,"Wir stehen auf der Straße, wann ist es soweit?
Seit heute ist alles Vergangenheit.
Wir hängen rum und warten auf die neue Zeit,
gebt uns Gewehre für den letzten Streit. 

Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit 

Hoch geschlagen ziehen wir uns zurück
und nehmen die Leichen unserer Freunde mit.
Doch sehr bald wird dies alles vergessen sein,
und durch die Nacht tönt unser Schrei. 

Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit
Wir sind bereit"
322,Bananarama,Shy Boy,TRVDXSK128E078A9BC,1982,"He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat

I'm gonna give him all my love
Each and every night
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)

Everything we put together
Seems to last forever
He knows about a good time
Gonna make him all mine

He gives me lovin like nobody else
I like the way he turns me on
I wanna keep him all to myself
If my heart could beat that strong

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good

I'm gonna give him all my love
Each and every night
One thing I know he's dreaming of

323,John Cooper Clarke,A Heart Disease Called Love,TRXEOBI128F425A0F5,1982,"One kiss became a weapon
I don't want to bleed in vain
Clouds collide in the heavens
I surrender. To the rain
The death bells that also rang
like madness... from above
I'm going... out with a bang
And a heart disease called love

Ninety-nine, below zero
Would seem like fever now
You know me... no hero
Don't even ask me how
I'm down in the deep deep freeze
What was I thinking of...
In the painful breeze
By the frozen trees
With a heart disease called love

After dinner. Mints. A new lover
And the coffee's so bitter and black
Your fingerprints... they cover
this knife sticking out of my back
You overlooked... the fine details
You should've worn your gloves
I've got a girl in jail, and a house for sale
And a heart disease called love"
324,Bill Nelson,Eros Arriving,TRNPJVY128F1452C04,1982,"Curtains are closing
over my windows,
waiting for someone
who knows where the time goes…

This time it's working,
bodies uncover…
Every moment
belongs to another…

Here without warning,
the end of my tether…
I watch from the doorway,
some things take forever…

Curtains are closing
over my windows,
waiting for someone
who knows where the time goes…

This time it's working,
bodies uncover…
Every moment
belongs to another…

Eros arriving…"
325,Scritti Politti,Rock-a-boy Blue (2001 Digital Remaster),TRGRGUV128F14655A1,1982,"The girls are hip 'n' the men are divine
'n' everything is gin and roses
You are new to me an' I'm so happy
You can whisper and I will listen
The world becomes a motion picture
I got it beat oh I got it licked, yeah
Rock-a-girl blue
It seems so sad

But the film goes dim like a faraway star
A frozen frame like silver paper
When the kissing gets very hard
Just to try and get at something
When the representatives turn to leaders
As long as you know as long as you need us
We'll be there
You know it's true

Don't they love like a rock-a-boy should
Don't they rock like lonely lovers
Don't they want to make the money
Don't they want to be the Beatles
Things ain't clear, they're just transparent
The trick of the trade is to make them apparent-ly
Rock-a-boy blue
You know that I said that you know that

I learnt to live with the beats in the bar
Made me sick with repetition
I learnt to love that one note samba
No surprise or definition
I guess I can learn to love what I'm used to
If you can get used to just getting used by
Rock-a-boy blue
Baby, then more fool you

326,Siouxsie And The Banshees,Cascade,TRMLLVD128F9312BA4,1982,"Oh the Air was shining
Shining like a wedding ring
Barbed like sex
I felt 10,000 volts
My chest was full of eels
Pushing through my usual skin
I opened up new wounds
Pouting
Shouting

Oh, Love
Like liquid falling
Falling 
In cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades

The Sun was rich
Rich with a song of sin
My breath melted my words
Into strange alphabets
Tormenting my tongue
Pouting
Shouting

Oh, Love 
Like liquid falling
Falling 
In cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades

The heartbeats were echoing
Echoing 
The revolver
Emptying 
Into my mouth
I pulled a face 
From my pocket
And smiled 
A Leper's grin
I felt somebody close
Pouting
Shouting

Oh, Love 
Like liquid falling
Falling 
In cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing 
In cascades"
327,Squeeze,Out Of Touch,TRVPGWE128F4262C17,1982,"You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know it's not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But you're wasting your time  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
I'm so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesn't ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing   
Says she really couldn't tell  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I can't   

I won't comb my hair for you anymore  
I won't be in early  
I won't be in late  
I won't be in at all so don't sit in and wait  

You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But there's no chance  
Now there's no one else to see  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
I'm so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung"
