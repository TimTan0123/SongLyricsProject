0,Greg Lake,I Believe In Father Christmas,TRBKHKB128F93258A6,1975,"They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winters light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
They told me a fairy story
Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
I looked to the sky with excited eyes
Then I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish pain and sadness
Leave your heart and let your road be clear
They said there'd be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or Hell
The Christmas we get, we deserve"
1,Mocedades,Charango,TRUPYKT128F42A063F,1975,"Canta charango
que te ayude la quena al cantar
que se callen los enamorados
y el río se lleve la pena al mar. 

Cántale recio charango
mezcla de guitarra y fango
aún te queda mucha tierra
mucha queja en tus cantos.
Cántale a la piel de toro
que le dio sangre a tus cuerdas
y aún dormido ahí en tu vientre
un fandango de Huelva. 

Hoy ha muerto mi guitarra
mañana la he de enterrar
cántale recio charango
que me llora el cantar.
Muerta la que me cantaba
no me queda ya pregón
canta tú charango mío
si aún te vibra el bordón. 

Ella tenía poemas
y cantábame a la vida
pero ahora está dormida
y no sabe de penas."

Bwa-haa-haa!
You can hide down in the alley with your hat pulled over your eye.
You can wear a wig or moustache or any old disguise.
Well, you can change your name and your address, even change your style of clothes.
But the Shadow knows. The Shadow knows.

You thought you had me baffled, you thought I didn't know.
But I know where you goin', baby, long before you go.
You can't even snap your fingers or wiggle you toes.
Without the Shadow knows. The Shadow knows.

I say, ""Baby, stop your jiving, and your messing round"".
'Cause I know what you're putting, baby, long before you put it down.
You better mind your p's and q's, and your m's and n's and o's.
Because the Shadow knows. The Shadow knows.
Bwa-haa-haa! The Shadow knows..."
3,Carol Douglas,Doctor's Orders,TRXHSVD128F4227DAF,1975,"Hello?
Hi, honey, it's me
I went to see the doctor today
'Cause ever since you've been gone
I had a pain deep down inside
He said there's nothing really wrong with me
I'm just missing my man
So, honey, please come on home as soon as you can

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition 
Love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion 
Full of warm emotion

Every day
A loving spoonful to be taken
It's the only way
To stop this empty heart of mine from breaking

Won't get better till 
You're back again, he told me
Doctor's orders 
I need your loving arms to hold me

Darling now I know 
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love 
I can't live without it

You're away
But please don't treat me like a stranger
Doctor's orders say
One kiss from you and I am out of danger

Please say you understand how I feel, honey
I know you've got a lot of things on your mind
Oh, but I'm missing you so bad
Please, oh, please come on home

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition 
Love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion 
Full of warm emotion

Doctor's orders say 
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do

I can't live without it"
4,John Prine,He Was In Heaven Before He Died (LP Version),TRFPWDG128F92FE569,1975,"There's a rainbow of babies
Draped over the graveyard
Where all the dead sailors
Wait for their brides
And the cold bitter snow
Has strangled each grassblade
Where the salt from their tears
Washed out with the tide

And I smiled on the Wabash
The last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink
From the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep
As I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven
Before he died

Now the harbor's on fire
With the dreams and desires
Of a thousand young poets
Who failed 'cause they tried
For a rhyme without reason
Floats down to the bottom
Where the scavengers eat 'em
And wash in with the tide

And I smiled on the Wabash
The last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink
From the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep
As I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven
Before he died

The sun can play tricks
With your eyes on the highway
The moon can lay sideways
Till the ocean stands still
But a person can't tell
His best friend he loves him
Till time has stopped breathing
You're alone on the hill

And I smiled on the Wabash
The last time I passed it
Yes I gave her a wink
From the passenger side
And my foot fell asleep
As I swallowed my candy
Knowing he was in heaven
Before he died"
5,Kansas,It's You,TRFNWSH128F4264033,1975,"Give me your answer let me know today
I'm searching in wonder you're making me pay
I need you 'cause my life's turning grey
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue

You left a message to say you had fled
Couldn't believe that you wrote what I read
I couldn't count all the times I have said
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue

Love make my day
Show me the way

Give me your answer let me know today
I'm searching in wonder you're making me pay
I need you 'cause my life's turning grey
Oh, it's you, Oh I'm blue"

7,Kate & Anna McGarrigle,Kiss And Say Goodbye (Album Version),TRMLZKN128F147EE91,1975,"Call me when you're coming to town 
Just as soon as your plane puts down 
Call me on the telephone 
But only if you're travelling alone 
Counting down the hours 
Through the sunshine and the showers 
Today's the day 
You're finally going to come my way 

Let's make a date to see a movie 
Some foreign film from gay Paris 
I know you like to think you've got taste 
So I'll let you choose the time and place 
Have some dinner for two 
In some eastside rendezvous 
Then we'll walk 
Arm in arm around the block and talk 

Tonight you're mine 
Let's not waste time 

I do believe the die is cast 
Let's try and make the night-time last 
And I don't know where it's coming from 
But I want to kiss you till my mouth get numb 
I want to make love to you 
Till the day comes breaking through 
And when the sun is high in the sky 
We'll kiss and say goodbye"
8,Strawbs,Absent Friend (How I Need You),TRXWFWT128E0793BC4,1975,"Cousins

My ashtray's flowing over and the phone's left off the hook
I've been staring for three hours at the first page of a book
Day and night I keep the curtains drawn and curse the very day that I was born
And get to thinking how I need you now.

I keep staring at my wristwatch until its ticking fills the room
And the hollow sound reminds me of the silence of a tomb
And as the ceiling and the walls close in and the furniture begins to spin
I get to thinking how I need you now.

And as the days go passing by and I never get a letter
How I need you, how I need you
Days turn into weeks and it doesn't get much better
How I need you.

The gaslit streets lean slowly as I reel against the wall
And my musty head is aching as I stagger down the hall
Then I fill the broken glass once more and fling the empty bottle to the floor
And get to thinking how I need you."
9,The Newbeats,Bread And Butter,TRVVVFG128F93187B1,1975,"I like bread and butter,
I like toast and jam,
That's what my baby feeds me,
I'm her loving man.

He likes bread and butter,
He likes toast and jam,
That's what his baby feeds him,
He's her loving man.

She don't cook mashed potatoes,
She don't cook T-bone steaks,
Don't feed me peanut butter,
She knows that I can't take.

He likes bread and butter,
He likes toast and jam,
That's what his baby feeds him,
He's her loving man.

Got home early one morning,
Much to my surprise,
She was eating chicken and dumplings
With some other guy.

No more bread and butter,
No more toast and jam,
I found my baby eating
With some other man."
10,The Osmonds,The Proud One,TRVFTYL128F145FE92,1975,"Livin is dyin

Each night I dream baby, pretendin
Therell be a happy endin
Burnin down deep inside
Got a heartbreak that I cant hide

Youre the proud one, believe me
This poor man is down on his knees

Baby, please

The love we shared so tender
Hoping that forever youd me mine

11,Shirley Brown,I Can't Give You Up,TRYANPJ128F425C8F4,1975,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
Simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too.
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear,
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,
When it's so pleasant to hear you say

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Don't let the teardrops start
Don't do it baby
Girl please don't break my heart
Don't let us say goodbye
Let's give it one more try
Don't do it baby
Our love is too young too die

Girl just can't understand the reason why
When we had everything that money just can't buy
Why we have to call it quits. Call it a day
Girl I've just got to find a way to make you stay
Don't do it baby
Don't leave me this way

Don't do it baby
Don't let the teardrops start

Girl please don't break my heart
Don't let us say goodbye
Let's give it one more try
Don't do it baby

Well I know some people wouldn't understand
But we had seen a dream and held it in our hands
And I never thought that I would ever see the day
When I'd awake ant watch it all juste fade away

Don't leave me this way

Don't do it baby

13,Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel,Back To The Farm,TRFRUQA128E078281C,1975,"Harley

Only twilight, calm and barkless; no more daylight, only darkness;
Only twilight, only twilight made the change without delay

Hope'n' psyche, open brainy; they throw my key to the drainy;
Open psyche, open psyche - a chance to take without decay

Many attempts to swim puddles, lead to contempt, often muddled;
Many attempts, many attempts; someone's listening again

Nothing, no more come from judy; lots of colour come from moody
Nothing/no more, nothing/no more, I'm putting new coaches on the train

We was angry, no ! disheartended; stole the pantry, not the garden;
We was angry, we was angry - back to the farm, back to the farm

No more angry, no ! more busy; got me sanctuary, ask who is he?
No more angry, no, no angry - we're rolling around in hyper schemes"
14,Debbie Reynolds,Tammy,TRCICJY12903C95D34,1975,"I hear the cottonwoods whisperin' above
""Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love""
The ole hooty-owl hooty-hoos to the dove
""Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love""

Does my lover feel what I feel
When he comes near?
My heart beats so joyfully
You'd think that he could hear

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreamin' of
""Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love""

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know
Tammy, Tammy can't let him go
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low
""Tammy, Tammy, you love him so""

When the night is warm, soft and warm
I long for his charms
I'd sing like a violin
If I were in his arms

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of
""Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love"""
15,Justin Hayward / John Lodge,This Morning,TREAQNC128F426877E,1975,"As the dawn is breaking on your future my child
Is there none of your love alive?
If every door you open closes on me
I don't know if I can survive
I don't know if I can survive.

Long is the road that takes you from home,
My baby, oh my darling,
And sleepless are the hours
And lonely is the night
For the poor tormented soul
Who is searching for the light.

This morning I opened my eyes,
I knew from the silence that something was wrong.
Turning, I realised.
I wanted to cry when I knew I was alone.

But where will you go
And who will be your guide,
And which way will you turn,
The waters are so wide?
'Cos I never told you
No, you'll never really know,
I need you so.

Now the sun is rising on your freedom my child,
Is there none of your love alive?
Every door you open closes on me,
I don't know if I can survive, 
Knowing part of your love was lies.

Long is the road that takes you from home,
My baby, oh my darling,
And sleepless are the hours
And lonely is the night
For the poor tormented soul
Who is searching for the light.

The moment I opened my eyes,
I knew from the silence that something was wrong.
Turning, I realised.
I wanted to cry when I knew I was alone.

But where will you go
And who will be your guide,
And which way will you turn,

On a rainy,windy morning that's the day that i was born on
In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mammy left me,same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And i just thought i'd mention,my Grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why i'm standing here today
I got all my country learning,living and a churning
Pickin' cotton,rasin' hell,and bailin' hay

I've been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wudn't born no yesterday
Got a good Christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Caroline,i don't guess i'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin',and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car

Yeah it's hurry up and wait,in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And i pray to my soul,when you hear those ages roll
You better know i'm gonna get my share of mine

You've got to give a little love take a little love
Be prepared to forsake a little love
And when the sun comes shining through
We'll know what to do
Give a little love take a little love
Be prepared to forsake a little love
And when the sun comes shining through
We'll know what to do.

When I walk with you there is just we two
And the world goes by but I just don't care
And I know one day that I'll find the way
To be safe and sound within your heart
So until I do I'm gonna give a little love take a little love

For every drunk that I've hear hollar

On a pony she named Wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down its stall
In a blizard he was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

By the dark of the moon - I planted
But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot-owl howling by my window now
For six nights in a row
She's coming for me I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

Along that freeway line

I wa gettintired of walkin'
So I pulled him over to the side
Say man can you tell me where I can find
Just a little peace of mind
I'm gettin' tired of city livin'
And the orders I've been given
And the way I see it is I could be runnin' out of time
He said man I've got just the place
where you and freedom come face to face
I know just how you feel, this place is unreal
You won't believe it when you see it
Man it's fr out of space
I do declare I want to take you there
I do declare I want to take you where
Where the people live without it
Don't concern themselves about it
'Cos they know they've got a reason
And they ain't about to leave it
I declare I want to take you where
Where the honeysuckle's climbin'
And there ain't no sense of timin'
And you'll never need remindin'
Why you left and why you came out here
Clare it was just an hour's drive away
Now listen close to everything I say
We passed through the city limits
And clare what lay within it
Was enough to blow your mind away
S come nclare get the hell out of there

Tear out your hait

Mi metto in tasca un piccolo fiore,
mi metto in tasca un piccolo fiore.
Ti legassero stretta alla quercia più vecchia,

E mi piace poi tanto quel suo modo di fare,

Not so very far from the stories we know
Of ballads and the million in gold
He's now hatin'

To believe and to outrun you blind
With a lot of ease he can spin you a line
But take heed, 'cause when the magic declines
He'll be sayin'

Somebody, somebody, when I get to feel so fine
Nobody, nobody, when I get to feel like cryin'


I got a crowd like I never seen before
Five hundred crazy women just a-rappin' at my door
You work at night when the latter day is done
You burn your heart out brother and before you see the sun

For his love of Miss Hedy Lamarr
He holds above his true passion guitar
But he don't impress Persian the Shah
But who's carin'?

Somebody, somebody, when I get to feel so fine
Nobody, nobody, when I get to feel like cryin'"
27,Chris De Burgh,Just Another Poor Boy,TRYGNQT128F1467498,1975,"He was but a traveller on the lonely road of life
She, her name was Mary, A lady of the night
She found him lying in that road, on a winter's night so cold,
Just another poor boy, treat him right

She saw that he was hungry and gave him food to eat
She knew that he was weary an he had no place to sleep
She took him home to her own bed, she lay down his wounded head
And washed away the world from his hands and his knees

He was just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
When he cried out in his sleep she held him tight
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And she gave him love and comfort throught the night
Till the morning light ..

At night she sat beside him, by the fire they would talk
He said all men were brothers and that love could conquer all
Many gathered round to hear, many for his life did fear
In troubled times like these men seldom talk

Oh they came for him one morning at the breaking of the day
She woke to to hear him calling as they carried him away
Accusing him of spreading lies and hate,

His public meetings were a danger to the state
Some soldier said "" Who was he anyway ??""

Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And the tears were falling from her face like rain
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And they hung him on a hillside far away
And on the ground she lay ...Poor boy... Oh, my Lord...
Oh my Lord ... Oh my Lord...

Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy,
And the tears were falling from her face like rain
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And the hung him on a hillside far away, just another poor boy
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy

And she'd never dreamed she'd see his face again .."

Feel so dizzy underneath your open skies
And it's strange the games we play to hide the crime

I am a prisoner who has thrown away the key
My soul has vanished with a bird who flies so free
And wings of change have strapped themselves o'er me
Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive

I am waiting here for the tide to turn
And the byways of the air to open
Will you lead me there, by the broken stairway to the clouds
To the clouds

I am a changeling like the wind across the waves

I will return one day with all the time you gave

A motor-bike ride in the midday heat,
The dust that hung from the desert skies,
Run though we'd run it still burned our eyes,

Oh yes we may walk on the wild wild side of life,
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side,
And in the shadows of a promise you can take my hand,
And show me a way to understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way,
Yes if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you can stand by me,
And if you really really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.

A reckless nite in a nameless town,
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound,
A beach that wept with deserted waves,
That's where we slept knowing we'd be safe,
Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me,
But there's a lot I can learn and a lot that I've yet to see,
You know you've got my life lying in your hands,
It's up to you to make me understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way,

Yes if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you can stand by me,
And if you really really want me to stay,

Hun har tusener av hjerter
evig lever hennes kropp
men hun kan aldri kjenne smerter

og hun vil jage deg som du har jaget henne

Du kan stanse hennes hjerteslag
og knuse hennes øye
men hun vil alltid gi deg neste dag

At twenty-five


And this part reminds me of my lady
She loves me she's waitin' at home
And the baby she's makin'

How she trusts me so
And all of the sad times the bitter taste
Left by the struggle to grow
Must my baby know the blues

So if you're still listenin'
I hope you'll remember
The kid with the big white guitar
And all the sad stories to tell

I went home she'll be worryin'
And missin' me so
How long can I let it drive

Crass displays of acute embarrassment would make you cringe
Spend your money elsewhere

When the plastic actresses take off their clothes
Just to demonstrate all their curves and cleavages
and subtleties, quite forgetting their hair

Please do not take it seriously
Really, what a joke!

Mirthless merriment, sickly sentiments
So commonplace it would bore you to tears

Falling over singing, hoping that you'll share it"

I guess we got born in the wrong time - hid by clouds,

I never can say goodbye 

Every time I think I've had enough 
And start heading for the door 
There's a very strange vibration 
Piercing me right to the core 
It says, ""turn around you fool 
You know you love him more and more""
Tell me why is it so 
Don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

I never can say goodbye, oh no, I 
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems 
Soon are all gonna work out 
But there's that same unhappy feeling 
And that anguish and that doubt 
It's that same old dizzy hang-up 
I can't do with you or without 
Tell me why is it so
I don't want to let you go

And Sandy is the sea
Sandy is the clear blue sky
Or so it seems to me
Yes I see her everywhere
In everything I see
She can turn to anything
That she would like to be

Sandy is the summer's day
She laughs inside the brook
Sandy is and autumn moon
She shines down when I look
Sandy is a cozy fire
On a snowy winter's night
And Sandy is the soft spring rain
In the early morning light

Sandy is my mirror
There are secrets in her eyes
And every single morning
She dawns a new disguise
She has caught the mystery
Of all that's wild and free
Oh yes, I see the world in her
For she means the world to me"

Below the moon
Walking down the avenue
I’m followed by the afterglow
The velvet rose
Of evening grows

Weary to be home again
Among the faces of my friends
The day is done
Candles burning by the sea
Are waiting for me patiently
I wish the same
For you"

I gave you no name
My love and my money
Did you think I would chase it in the rain? 
My eyes are now open
But what do I see?
One ride after midnight
Had I thought it would mean that much to me? 

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
Do you think you can make it in the end?
Do you think that you can make it, my friend? 

I thought it was easy
But what did I know
Of old men and first blood
Or the drunk who gets taken blow by blow? 

The dice are all loaded
You pay by the throw
But you pay the loser
Seems the rain is turning into snow 

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
Do you think you can make it in the end?
Do you think that you can make it, my friend? 

We stand round your doorways
You hang on the walls
Your frames are your windows
Put your bodies on the stalls
You take all our money
We leave you no name
We're dealt just the one card
But the dealer plays in every game 

Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs a friend
Everybody needs someone to care
Do you think you can make it in the end?
Do you think that you can make it, my friend?"

I think I'm goin' back
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth
I think Im returning to
To the things I learned so well in my youth.

Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb
But thinking young and growing older ain't no sin
And I can play the game of life to win.

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to my best friend
Now I think I've got
A lot more than just these toys to lend.

Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be a magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back.

Just trying to get back for what you borrowed in time
The moral of the story's for a limited crew
But we're gonna be there in the chosen few 

But meanwhile tomorrow, I'll try to find me a scene
There's got to be an easy way to turn my money green
With such a promising future there ain't no way to go wrong
But the line that I walk just keeps taking too long
There'll be a rainbow on morning of the following day
But how we're gonna find it I just can't say at all

If I live tomorrow like I'm living today

We must pull it
With shackles around our necks

89,Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band,Jungleland,TRZXBEL12903C9FC23,1975,"The rangers had a homecoming 
In Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine 
Over the Jersey state line

Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane

Well, the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo 
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids around here look just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands

From the churches to the jails 
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand 
Down in Jungleland

The midnight gangs assembled 
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign 
That brings this fair city light

Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cop's cherry top 
Rips this holy night

The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
Hustling for the record machine

The hungry and the hunted 
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
That faced off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland

In the parking lot
The visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside, the backstreet girls 
Are dancing to the records that the DJ plays

Lonely hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
With just one look and a whisper
They're gone

Beneath the city, two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender 
In a bedroom locked, in whispers of soft 
Refusal, and then surrender 

In the tunnels uptown,
The Rat's own dream guns him down 
The shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light

Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy 
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be

And in the quick of the night, they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland"

There must be something I can dream tonight,
The air is filled with the moves of you,
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah. 

Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad
That our friends can't be with us today."

Of a fun life but a dumb life in a way

All along there but we left there in a way.

I didn't know just what to do

Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
Walking behind was a bay
The red headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
And his lips they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy this night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow haired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled the stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free of course
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again"

Have I gone to far
Have I lost my mind
Where are my eyes
Oh have I seen to much
Have I lost my touch
Losing directions from growing infections
Poisoned desires of reaping life so young

What will I be like
When my head is bear
And my legs are weak
Will I be strong or barely keep alive
When I'm thirty-five
Reaching dimentions that shatter conventions
Leads me to fear that I'm growing old too soon

With every step and every breath
It's farther from youth and closer to death
And that things I've realized
Now beckon me to shut my eyes
And I will grow to the age of maybe eighty years
In such little time
With this venturous mind

What am I saying
Don't I know myself from experience
I'll never change
Nor cease to sail the sky
Till the day I die
I'll come to conclusion with fear or illusion
I'll live how I feel
Cause no matter how fast or how slow
Youth will go"

The sleepy brown woods seem to
Nod down their heads to the Winter.
Yellows and grays
Paint the sad skies today
And I wonder when
You're coming home.

Woke up one morning
The wind through the window
Reminded me Winter
Was just 'round the bend.
Somehow I just didn't
See it was coming
It took me by surprise again.

And I hear you're in San Francisco
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.
And her husband's way down in Georgia
And I'm still in old Tennessee...
Wishing you'd come home to me.

Life here is easy
I'm sure you recall
How it's so warm and breezy
In the Summer and the Fall.
But Winter's upon me
And I've got no heat here
And I miss your fire so sweet, Dear
I miss your fire so sweet.

And I hear you're in San Francisco
Living with your sister who's a mother to be.
And her husband's way down in Georgia
And I'm still in old Tennessee...
Wishing you'd come home to me.

97,Kansas,The Devil Game,TRKUAWP128F426E818,1975,"I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall,
So many men have drowned in evil, and left Lucifer standing tall
Don't take the devil's dare, don't gamble when the game ain't fair,
Lock and bolt the doors, can't let the devil use you anymore

You got to listen all you mugs and reivers, if you do any wrong
You make it right
You can't be a make-believer, 'cause soon you're gonna pay the price,
Lying, hate and pain, all part of the devil game,
Got his foot inside the door, but you can't let him use you anymore

Take, he will take, he will take, give him nothing he'll take, he will take
He will take, he will give nothing but he'll take

Pray, for devils have no reason, Satan waits to curse your ways,
Have you seen it in his eyes in the sunset,
Have you wondered if he's laughing when you play,
Has he asked if you're alone if what he sees is all you own,
Has he offered you happiness, money, or much better lays
Satan leave me, leave me lonely, leave us alone

I've got books that say the good man's golden
And more that say the bad will fall,
Take a look at what the future's holdin',
Won't be yours if you don't heed this call,
Life is a game, and the stakes will remain the same.
Now you've gotta choose, is the devil gonna win or lose again"

Waiting patiently,

so rich in Earth's delights

No man rules this land, 
no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently,

So the maiden lies in waiting, 
for the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abundance, 
innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure, 
full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure.....

Across the sea there came a multitude, 
sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia, 
and the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder, 
rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under.....

Highways scar the mountainsides, 
buildings to the sky, 
people all around
Houses stand in endless rows, 
sea to shining sea, 
people all around
So we rule this land, 
and here we stand upon our paradise,
Dreaming of a place, 
our weary race is ready to arise"

Absolutely he's in definite need

Of a woman, child, and some better kind of love when the hot town's hurt him
And he knows how happy he could be
But he don't know if he can make it
Between the money and another lonely night
But now the time has come
Got to stay or run
Now the time has come

Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonely

Another pretty face another body ache still awake three-thirty
Dial another number -- No one home
So he wastes his time with TV
And he wonders if he lost the only one
And wonders if he's free
Too afraid to see
How alone he could be

To be true as the tide and free as the wind swell

There are dreams that I have carried all my lifetime
And the dreams have made me a stranger
In the eyes of many a man
For I do not count the time and my reasons do not rhyme
And down the line and on my way, on my way again
Oh, rolling along like a shipwrecked sailor
Who never finds a home
Broken lines and signs of failure
Rub me to the bone

I'm weary of the city with its heart of hollow stone

Well they pick me up and they spin me round
Tell me where do we go?
Tell me where do we go from here?

What are we gonna find out? (Find out)
What are we gonna find out (Find out)
In the wilderness
That this loneliness brings?

Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
I'll carry on
Won't you hold me?

When is man gonna find out? (Find out)
When are we gonna find out (Find out)

Alone, deserted by a warm spotlight
I breathe the meaning of the words that I must need her.

The colder seas of my sleeping mind
Make muddy dreams until no peace I find
Through Fields Elysian beg to see my life again, once again.

And here I stand at last revealed a clown  (revealed the clown)  revealed the clown
And who can doubt this painted fool who walks upon this circus stage is just a clown ?

No mind to colour now, no page to write
Cold pools of morning stain the virgin white
Another day without her love and I still need her.

And so the stage is set, the time is right
And waves of laughter shake the gods tonight
Another day will make a fool delight the children.

And so I stand at last revealed a clown, revealed the clown
And who can doubt the painted fool upon this circus stage has always been a clown ?

And so I stand at last revealed a clown, revealed the clown
And who can doubt this painted fool who maybe has no mind at all
Would ever walk where he might fall and gain the laughter of us all
Who can doubt the painted fool who always walk upon this stage is just a clown, is just a clown ?
Just a clown, is just a clown ?
Just a clown ?"

The devil followed him around
You always know when grass wouldn't grow
Where his foot wouldn't touch the ground

And make the fire come tumbling down

And he ran to his mother, the fear dark in his heart
And he told her of the vision that he was sure he'd seen
She said: ""Go back to sleep son, you're having a bad dream!""

Silly child--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Remember Chicken Little said the sky was falling down
Well nothing ever came of that, the world still whirls around

""The rock is gonna fall on us,"" he stood and told the class
The professor put his chalk down and peered out through his glasses
But he went on and said; ""I've seen it, high up on the hill
If it doesn't fall this year then very soon it will!""

Crazy boy--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
We've more important studies than your fantasies and fears
You know that rock's been perched up there for a hundred thousand years

""The rock is gonna fall on us."" He told the magistrates
""I believe that we can stop it but the time is getting late
You see I've done all the research my plans are all complete.""
He was showing them contingencies when they showed him to the street

Just a madman--
Everybody knows the rock leans over the town
Everybody knows that it won't tumble to the ground
Everybody knows of those who say the end is near
Everybody knows that life goes on as usual round here

He went up on the mountain beside the giant stone
They knew he was insane so they left him all alone
He'd given up enlisting help for there was no one else
He spent his days devising ways to stop the rock himself
One night while he was working building braces on the ledge
The ground began to rumble the rock trembled on the edge

""The rock is gonna fall on us! Run or you'll all be crushed!""
And indeed the rock was moving, crumbling all to dust
He ran under it with one last hope that he could add a prop
And as he disappeared the rock came to a stop

The people ran into the street but by then all was still
The rock seemed where it always was or where it always will be
When someone asked where he had gone they said: ""Oh he was daft.
Who cares about that crazy fool."" And then they'd start to laugh

But high up on the mountain
When the wind is hitting it
If you're watching very closely
The rock slips a little bit"

Why was I born and I'm cursed repeatedly?
Who would know if I should die?
No one needed me.

Doo doo doo doo doo ...

Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come. 
Cold and silent was the house my name was on. 
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one. 
So dark and empty was the place to which I'd come. 

All at once my bones began to change. 
I was tall and young again, 
Sweet as rain falling on the snow. 
Who, who, who, who? 
Who is he?  Who am I? 
And what laid in between? 
How can I say goodbye? 
No one let me in.

Can't see no need for Nine no more

And she ain't goin' nowhere she can't breathe in
And she ain't goin' home and that's for sure

She's not sittin' down and cryin' on her suitcase 
She has no second thoughts by the road
But she's got feelings than need some reparin'
And she did not give a damn that it showed

But she ain't goin' nowhere, she's just leavin'
And she ain't goin' nowhere she can't breathe in

And the wind had it's way with her hair
And the blues have a way with her smile

Skulle det va gulligt då
Om jag sa tre rara ord varenda gång du grät
Skulle det bli bättre så

Allting ordnar sej perfekt om du ger honom en kyss
Ja, det var visst så dom sjöng i min transistor helt nyss
Och när solen sjunker, sjunger jag om frihet och strid
Och min flydda ungdoms tid

Om du inte går och grubblar när det känns så fel
Kommer lyckan ju en dag
Ödet rår man inte på, allting är som ett spel
Sån är livets hårda lag

Men små sånger hjälper både mot tristess och mot gråt
Lyckans vägar kan man ändå inte göra nåt åt
Men om man tar det som det kommer, det är så uppenbart klart
Fixar allting till sej snart

När din vän har sagt farväl till dej och vandrat sta
Mot den stora kärleken
Ska du inte fälla tårar, allt ska bli så bra
Mellan er en gång igen

Om du bara ler och tittar passionerat mot den
Du har kär kanhända han en gång blir din hjärtevän
Om du bara drömmer sött och glömmer alla besvär
Får du nog en miljonär"

'Cause we need some security
You get a little bad luck and it grows and it grows
I'm the black sheep of the family

I've got half a pound of rice, a beard full of lice
A mission called retrogression
I've got a pocket full of dust and eating is a must

While other folks are living high off the hog
I'm the black sheep of the family

Don't talk to me about society
You got to play the rules or pay the penalty
Because there's nothing to choose
Between a handful of blues
Double indemnity

All the words are wrong, and my shadow's getting long
I realise this song don't mean much
I got an ache in my head, I want to go to bed
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no

So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
'Cause it's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say
I'm the black sheep of the family

Oh my, wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
It's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way, it's true what they say

At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and steppin' out over the line

Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap
It's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, and baby, we'll never go back

Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I wanna know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace
Hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss, huh

One, two, three, four
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all of the madness in my soul

Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun
But 'til then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Aw, honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on, Wendy, tramps like us

But my friends never, no, never held you close at night
Every dream I had, that could see the light
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you
Well you went and it walked out the front door with you

I never knew, I never thought that you'd take my love and tear it apart
I gave you my best, when I gave you my heart

Oh, are you listening? Or is this all in vain? 
I still can't believe, you're never comin' back again
Everything I had, oh, except my pain

Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?

Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real, to trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks

Oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road

Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight
Take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
Tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

And in the lonely cool before dawn, you hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
So Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win"

In his wake he leaves scorched earth and work in vain;
smoke drifts up behind him - he is free again,
free to run before the onslaught of a deadly foe,
leaving nothing fit for pillage, hardly leaving home.
It's far too late to turn, unless it's to stone.
Charging madly forward, tracks across the snow;
wind screams madness to him, ever on he goes,
leaving spoor to mark his passage, trace his weary climb.
Cross the moor and make the headland -
stumbling, wayward, blind.
In the end his footprints extend as one single line.

This latest exponent of heresy is goaded into an attack,
persuaded to charge at his enemy.
Too late, he knows it is,
too late now to turn back, too soon by far to falter.
The past sits uneasily at his rear,
he's walking right into the trap,
surrounded, but striving through will and fear.
Ahead of him he knows there waits an ambuscade
but the dice slip through his fingers
and he's living from day to day,
carrying his world around upon his back,
leaving nothing behind but the tell-tale of his track.

He will not be hostage, he will not be slave,
no snare of past can trap him, though the future may.
Still he runs and burns behind him in advanced retreat;
still his life remains unfettered - he denies defeat.
It's far too late to turn, unless it's to stone.
Leave the past to burn - at least that's been his own.

Scorched earth, that's all that's left when he's done;
holding nothing but beholden to no-one,
claiming nothing, out of no false pride, he survives.
Snow tracks are all that's left to be seen
of a man who entered the course of a dream,
claiming nothing but the life he's known
- this, at least, has been his own."
158,Curtis Mayfield,Jesus (LP Version),TRJEGDI128F14A26E0,1975,"Maybe the words I say is just another way to pray
I don’t know
Don’t think that I’m any saint ’cause
I can’t do nothin’ for you
I only asked of you just as I got to do myself
Look into your inner self only you know how to be
free
If you wanna grin let it smile
Feel a little happy go on and dance a while
Can nobody play down God’s lovin’ child
‘Cause when the spirit hits you you got to move
And just as He made us one of many
Then aren’t the many of us maybe only one
surely can you be the rising sun but 
The depth of night the light for sight
Sort of sets the moral standards of soul
Gives you the strength to pay the price of life
And rewards you with a bit of fulfillment
The definition of true He is more real than you
isn’t he?

Almighty Doctor must have been a heavenly man
JESUS!
Lot of inspiration all over this land Jesus
In spite of your fears you can shed happy tears
Jesus!
Don’t care what you call Him none can befall Him
Hear me say Amen! Amen! Amen! Hear me say
Amen!
Now stand up and clap your hands
Amen! Amen! Amen! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Travelin’ Soul the way the story goes
We all know He was crucified
But what He gave us never will die!
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time!
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new temptation
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
and drinkin’ and drinkin’

The world I see before me is tryin’ to make me a slave
Jesus!
Than to see many children hungry
I’d rather go to my grave Jesus!
The lovin’ way of life
Has terribly been arranged Jesus!
Something’s mighty mighty wrong
And it seems awful strange
Just like a back up gear there are those in fear
Of falling near we who are already here
Look-a-here, look-a-here, look-a-here
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new relations
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
and a-
Talk about Jesus
Talk about Jesus"

I'm gettin' harder pressed
To find a reason to shave
Watchin' the hours
Just slippin' away
No motivation to get out of bed
And carry on the charade
Caught in a dream that's goin' astray
 
Oh, all those great expectations
Seems they never work out, never work out
The way that I plan
All those great expectations
Why they never work out, never work out
I can't understand
 
And just when I think
That things are goin' right
I get a call from L.A.
Sorry to say ""we're changin' your song""
I try to reason
But I can't get through
They're gonna do it their way
What can I say
They've never been wrong
 
Oh, all those great expectations
Seems they never work out, never work out
The way that I plan
All those great expectations
Why they never work out, never work out

Sometimes you get an Edsel

I was turned out of Cafe Cologne
As the sun came up the cock was crowing,
And the ground kept swaying underneath my feet,
All the drifters are Americans,
Chasing dreams to Amsterdam,
Stumbling briskly past me on the street,
And I've got this feeling in my heart,
That it's time to raise the blinds and change the scene;
AND DOWN THE ROAD I'M GOING
I paint miracles on pavements,
And don't expect no payment,
Unless of course the stranger's feeling kind,
I've lived this way for years and years,
And sometimes shed a madman's tears,
But my head's bursting with life most of the time;
And I've got this feeling in my heart,
That it's time to raise the blinds and change the scene;
And down the road i'm going"

I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky

Through it I fly

And even though I'm sitting, waiting for Mars

Then you went and spoiled it all by eating it

Woman, do you love me?
Woman, if you need me then
Believe me I need you
To be my woman

And should you ask me how I'm doing
What shall I say? Things are OK
But I know that they're not
And I still may have lost you

Woman, do you love me?
Woman, if you need me then
Believe me I need you
To be my woman

I guess you'll take your time and tell me
When we're alone, love will come home
I would give up my world
If you'll say that my girl is my woman

I've got plenty of time
Just to get through it
Once again you'll be mine
I still think we can do it
And you know how much I love you

Woman, don't forsake me
Woman, if you take me then
Believe me I'll take you
To be my woman"

Chorus:
Pissin' in the wind, bettin' on a losing friend
Makin' the same mistakes, we swore we'd never make again
And we're pissin' in the wind, but it's blowing on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

About the time I called this Guy it was four in the morning
Teach me the words to the song I was humming

He just laughed and he said that the ole grey cat is sneakin' down the hall
But all he wants to know is who in the hell is paying for the call

Chorus

Now this Nunn called me up, it was eight in the morning
Wanted to know how in the world am I doin'
He just laughed and he said get together boy, and fall on by the house
Some Gonzo buddies would like to play anything your's picking now

Chorus

Now we worked and we suffered and struggled
Makin' our record till we got it right
Now we're waiting on the check to come sneaking down the hall
Like that old time feeling
That we never should have ever put the record out at all

Chorus

That the answer my friend is just pissin' in the wind
The answer is pissin' in the sink"

Warm summer breeze blows endlessly
Touching the hearts of those who feel

Bird on a wing goes floating by
But there's a teardrop in his eye

Letting the symmetry flow,
Up from my roots to the sky.
Fed by the fires of the earth,
Sweet osmosis come quench my thirst.
Just one more deep drink for me,
One more ring of life around this tree.
 
I'm moving, improving my view,
Claiming my right to the sun.
Adding on is nothing new,
When it all adds up to one.
Two, three, four more points in time,
These all become well spaced lines.
Curving a pattern through me,
One more ring of life around this tree.
 
Ring around the roses,
Pocketful of posies,
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down."

'Cause there's a reward for me, oooh yeah
There's a reward for me.

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
You know no one cares for me
I've never known sympathy
Sometimes I look to the world with a smile
Man you hear what I say

Everyday my heart is sore
Seeing that I'm so poor
But I shall not give up so easy
Oh no no no no non no
'Cause there's a reward for me
'Cause there's a reward for me.

Killing you softly with flashing light bulbs
Lifting your soul with a tattooed sigh

That no boy can fill
With her hands on her hips

With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream
I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots
And French kisses will not break that heart of stone

With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Oh, she's the one
She's the one

That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark
It says you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies
And all you want to do is believe her

And tonight you'll try just one more time
To leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh she can take you but if she wants to break you
She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do

And no matter where you sleep tonight
Or how far you run
Oh, she's the one
She's the one

Oh, and just one kiss, she'd fill them long summer nights
With her tenderness
That secret pact you made back when her love could save you
From the bitterness

Cos this hurting feeling is
Oh so good for me

Now you are old, you’re over the hill
You can’t cross the palm of time’s hand
Silver and gold to make him stand still

Who could’ve possibly thought 
It would go so fast
But it certainly did

Now, you find yourself caught
With less future than past
You’re no longer a kid

Once as a boy time weighted heavy on your hands
You couldn’t wait to be a man
Now you cry, oh, it’s so hard to laugh
And you can’t understand
Why you can’t turn time around

Your hourglass once had a top half
It was filled full of sand
But it’s all trickled down"
210,The Charlie Daniels Band,Willie Jones,TRCMZZV128F427026B,1975,"Willie Jones was a man I met when I lived in Baltimore
I was a guard and he was doing time
In the three long years he stayed there I got to know him well
Willie Jones he was a friend of mine

He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
And he talked about the southland though he'd drifted from its shores
I never seen a man who loved it more

He talked about the whippoorwills in the Alabama night
Honeysuckle vine and sugar cane
Swimming holes and fishing poles and early morning frost
And sleeping under a tin roof when it rained

He talked about a country road and a cabin in the pines
And a girl with wavy long chestnut brown hair
He talked about the beauty of his Blue Ridge Mountain home
And darn near made me think that I was there

He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there
When a man ain't got no freedom the time sure passes slow
Willie Jones had ten long years to go

It's been almost a years now since that hot night in July
Willie hit the guard and jumped the fence
I had my rifle ready but I couldn't let it fly
I shot over his head and we ain't seen him since

Then last week the postman brought a letter to my door
Marked No Return Address and No Reply
It just said nobody north of Birmingham is gonna see this boy again
But if you're ever down our way won't you please drop by

He used to say buddy you know where I'm going when they let me out of here
Alabama could be heaven if the Lord was there

Standing so close you make my fires tremble and my mind unclear

Burning up the highway, sun's rising
My horizons deepen with the blue
Old southbound wind, it's makin' me colder 
And holding you closer I find your troubles aren't mine to lend

Next of kin, do you have to rub it in

I think I've had my fill of the river's restless flow
All in all, I could wait until the river is still

And the ice is on the benches
Another mad runner, have I used up all my chances

When they listen to the rain splashes
Grasping dry leaves through the open door
Do you really want to see me here anymore
It's a simple question I've learned my lesson now
So please let me come in

Close the curtains, let our love begin"

When we really do believe in each other through you.

Lord, take us by the hand so we understand the meaning of love
We've grown so far apart, nowhere to start or try to make up
The peace we could come to, to see by
The answer is simply we just try.

Well your strength just shatters me
As I scramble for my pieces
But the puzzle keeps repeating
It seems so self-defeating
How we plan each move so carefully
Chorus:
And still we both hang on
We risk a night and greet the down 
AN affair for you - for me a song
Then suddenly it's over
Two cynics passing through
I blew it - I fell in love with you
The thing I swore I'd never do
And now m love just turns you colder
you say you're trying to find yourself
Well I know how hard that is
And I wish that I could help you
To share while like keeps teaching
To share while you keep reaching
But you prefer to reach out privately

I spoke as a child

I look like a man
I'm old as a man
And I should know better
Got my head in the sky
And my mind knows what it wants
But my body just drags me down
And my world is something you can't see
But it's still very real to me
You can find it in the hole where I keep my soul
There it is - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about my body and be a real man

I see with my heart
I hear with my heart
I feel with my heart
Sometimes it works better
And some so-called friends put me down
And they pity me for trying
Bad emotions push me around
But the vision shines on and on
It will shine when we all are gone
And I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here
Light it up - way down inside me
There's a real man
Forget about bad feelings and be a real man

Some men's world is only hate and money
Afraid of everything and they laugh at nothing
And they only live to criticize
You can laugh at me now (ha ha ha)
But the time comes to everybody
When you must decide
When that day finally comes along
You might wish you'd been a little more strong
Then you'll wake up in the morning cryin'
""Oh my God""
There it is - way down inside me
It's a real man
You got to grow up sometime
Be a real man
Suffer them slings and arrows
Be a real man
Now be a real man
Don't sell yourself for nothing
Be a real man
Don't take no crap from no one
Be a real man
Get your trip together
Be a real man"

a fair maid I did meet,
She asked me to see her home—
she lived in Bleecker Street.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And when we got to Bleecker Street,
We stopped at forty-four,
Her mother and her sister there,
to meet her at the door.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And when I got inside the house,
The drinks were passed around,
The liquor was so awful strong,
My head went round and round.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And then we had another drink,
before we sat to eat,
The liquor was so awful strong,
I quickly fell asleep.

Henry Crun [spoken]: Oh, come on, Min; play that modern banjo, Min.
Minnie Bannister: Ya pa pa pa pa....

When I awoke next morning
I had an aching head,
There was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in me bed.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

My gold watch and my pocketbook
And lady friend were gone;
And there was I, Jack all alone,
Stark naked in the room.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

On looking round this little room,
There's nothing I could see,
But a woman's shift and apron
That were no use to me.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes,
Down Cherry Street forlorn,
There Martin Churchill took me in,
And sent me 'round Cape Horn.

And away you santy, my dear honey,
O you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

I think I might never know true love again 
I'm lost with no road signs to guide me
A slave to my whiskey and dreams
Bells of the evening, O bells that I love
I've got some feelings I long to be rid of 

I'm not one to ramble; I'm not one to boast
Though I had one lover more lovely than most
She was a country girl born to be free
Who took to the city by chance there to find me 

Bells of the evening go pealin'
I'm down here listenin' to you
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her, that I'm lost and so lonely 

Bells of the evening, your sweet Sunday sound
Reminds me of the redwoods and moss covered ground
So if I should wander on back to the coast
Tell her to remember it's her I need the most 

I'm caught by the minstrel's misfortune
Of being forever displaced
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her; That I'm lost I'm so lonely"

In my lap like a child.
You'd cling to me smilin'
Your eyes wide and wild.
Now you slip through my arms,
Wave a passing hello.
Twist away and toss a kiss
Laughin' as you go.

You used to say ""Read me a story.""
And, ""Sing me songs of love.""
For you were Princess Paradise 
On the wings of a dove.
Now I chase you and I tease you
Tryin' to remake you my own,
You just turn away and say,
""Please leave me alone.""

And I'm a tangled up puppet
All hangin' in your strings.
I'm a butterfly in a spider's web
Fluttering my wings.
And the more that I keep dancin'
And spinning 'round in knots
The more I see what used to be
And the less of you I've got.

You are a drawer full of make-up
And rinses and things.
You keep changing your moods,
Like your earrings and rings.
But tonight while we played tag
For five minutes in the yard,
Just for a moment I caught you off-guard.

And I'm a tangled up puppet
All hangin' in your strings.
I'm a butterfly in a spider's web
Fluttering my wings.
And the more that I keep dancing
And spinning 'round in knots,
The more I see what used to be
And the less of you I've got.

Now you write your secret poems
In a room just for your dreams.
You don't find time to talk to me
About the things you mean,
And what I mean is--

I have watched you take shape
From a jumble of parts
And find the grace and form 
Of a fine work of art.
Hey, you, my brand new woman
Newly come into your own,
Don't you know
That you don't need
To grow up all alone."
225,Joan Manuel Serrat,Conversando con la Noche y con el Viento,TRLFAEH128F42ABE05,1975,"Empeñado en barrer
El atardecer
Sorprendí al viento.
Era un chiquillo desnudo
Que al verme, me brincó al cuello
Y se puso a enredar con mi cabello.

Temblaba su voz
Entre las ramas del manzano.
Silbaba entre los cañizos
Cosas que uno anda cantando
Y nos pilló la noche conversando.

De atardeceres
Y de soledades...
De andar y andar
Buscando verdades
Para encontrar
Siempre otra pregunta
Ir y venir
Y no llegar nunca.

Corazón de pluma
¿pa' qué pierdes el tiempo
Conversando con la noche y con el viento?...

Volvía del Sur...
Era perezoso y caliente,
Con las alforjas cargadas
De polvareda y simientes
De otros sementeros y otras gentes.

Tenía tanto para contar
Desde el árbol de las manzanas...
Tantas imaginaciones, que
La noche se resbalaba
Por sentarse a oír lo que contaba."

In a broken Stone Age dawn
You fly so high

Oh, it's a strange magic
Got a strange magic

You're walking meadows in my mind
Making waves across my time
Oh no, oh no.

I get a strange magic
Oh, what a strange magic

Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again

227,The Charlie Daniels Band,Damn Good Cowboy,TRUDHSK128F427052B,1975,"He's the loosest dude I've ever been exposed to
He loves the bottle and a dirty joke
He likes to hang out on the street
And he'd rather fight than eat
And his nose and the women keep him broke 

He's been in every jail from here to Juarez
And every funky old backstreeet saloon
He's a victim of his fate
Born a hundred years too late
And sometimes I think
A hundred years too soon

He's a outlaw, He's a bum
He's a rounder and then some
He's as ornery as a redneck fool can be
He ain't ever gonna be no different
He's a damn good cowboy
And I hope to hell he stays in Tennessee

He didn't finish school or go to college
When he turned 16 he just had to go
And while everyone who did
Was building homes and having kids
He was out West ridin' in some rodeo

He got busted up in Cheyenne last September
And he had to get his hat and pack his trunk
And he came on back to town,
He just kinda hangs around
He's the local hero and the local drunk

He's a outlaw, He's a bum
He's a rounder and then some
He's as ornery as a redneck fool can be
He ain't ever gonna be no different
He's a damn good cowboy
And I hope to hell he stays in Tennessee

You may think he's a little crazy
And you may think that where he's at's nowhere
And in your righteous sight,
You just might be right
But he damn sure did have fun gettin' there

He's a outlaw, He's a bum
He's a rounder and then some
He's as ornery as a redneck fool can be
And if you don't like him you won't like me either
He's a damn good cowboy
And I hope to hell he stays in Tennessee"
228,Harry Belafonte,Man Piaba,TRKDMXV128F931AFDC,1975,"When I was a lad of three-foot-three
Certain questions occurred to me,
So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee.
He stammered and he stuttered pathetically
And this is what he said to me.

He said, ""The woman piaba and the man piaba
and the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round.
I went and ask a good friend of mine,
Known to the world as Albert Einstein.
He said ""Son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

It was clear as mud but it covered the ground
And the confusion made the brain go 'round.
I grabbed a boat and went abroad
In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud
He said ""Son, from your sad face remove the grouch
Put the body down up on the couch
I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation
Hey love and hate is psychosomatic
Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri pathetic
It all started with a broken sibling
In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling

That the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

Well I traveled far and I traveled wide
And I don't even have me self a bride
All the great men upon this earth
Have confused me since my birth
I've been over land and been over sea
Trying to find answer 'bout the bird and bee
But now that I am ninety three
I don't give a darn you see

If the woman piaba and the man piaba
And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch"
229,The Sensational Alex Harvey Band,Delilah,TRSTDQA128F930654D,1975,"I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
I saw the flickering shadows of love on the blinds
She was my woman
And as she betrayed me I watched and went out of my mind

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why, Delilah
I could see that girl was no good to me
And just like a slave I was lost and no man could free

At break of day when this man drove away, I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house, she opened the door
She stood there, laughing
And I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why, Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take anymore

She stood there, laughing
And I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall

Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

Well, I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window, a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner, things got real quiet real fast

I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid, you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city all the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half

Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, ""Break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening.""

Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, ""Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me.""

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, ""Take me please!""

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, ""Break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel."" 

So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.

She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks
She's taking her time from her grandfather clocks
And over the border, and down on the land
She's living in the future
and it lies in her hand

Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink
beneath the sunshine and the icicles
in the things that you think
There's a hole in my destiny
and I'm out on the brink
Mama lion, mama lion

Mama lion, mama lion, I'm starting to sink
beneath the sunshine and the icicles
in the things that you think
There's a hole in my destiny
and I'm out on the brink

For the frst time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy - but don't you touch


that ain't much - only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance

If we play it cool - It'll be all right

Is it the painter or the picture hanging in the gallery ?
Admired by countless thousands who attempt to read the secrets
Of his vision of his very soul.

Is it the painter or the picture hanging in the gallery ?
Or is it but a still life of his own interpretation
Of the way that God had made us in the image of His eye ?

Is it the sculptor or the sculpture standing in the gallery ?
Touched by fleeting strangers who desire to feel the strength of hands
That realised a form of life.

Is it the sculptor or the sculpture standing in the gallery ?
Or is it but the tenderness with which his hands were guided
To discard the unessentials and reveal the perfect truth ?

Is it the actor or the drama playing to the gallery ?
Heard in every corner of the theatre of cruelty
That masks the humour in his speech.

Is it the actor or the drama playing to the gallery ?
Or is it but the character of any single member of the audience
That forms the plot of each and every play ?

Is it the singer or his likeness hanging in the gallery ?
Tongue black, still and swollen, his eyes staring from their sockets
He is silent now, will sing no more.

Is it the singer or his likeness hanging in the gallery ?
Or is it but his conscience, insecurity and loneliness
When destiny becomes at last the cause of his demise ?"

Runnin' too hard
And I tore you all to pieces

Yes, but it's all over now
And I'm a little bit older now
The lessons that I'm learnin' now
Gonna make it easy somehow

Now then, can I try
Starting over
Put the pieces back together
Even as I cry bitter tears
I can see it's all a puzzle
A game, always the same

By the time I die with the passing
If I've sorted out my changes
And if you could take the time
I would tell you that it's still a puzzle
The same, always a game, ooh"

It was a frightening thought
And I, I began to cry
Someone asked why
Someone asked what for
'Cause something inside of me, something inside of me
Something inside of me said I was a witness to a war
I was a witness to what happened
And I hated what I saw
I was a witness to a war, to a war

I saw a woman dressed in black
Her husband isn't coming back, she didn't want him to go
They said he had to do his chores before
Their future could grow
And I, I began to cry
Someone asked why
Someone asked what for
'Cause something inside of me, something inside of me

I was a witness to the heartbreak
That some soldier's woman bore
I was a witness to a war, to a war

I saw an ugly field today
I saw an ugly field today where only crosses could grow
A monument to modern man, and now
There's no place to go
And I, I began to cry
But no-one asked why
No-one asked what for
But something inside of me, something inside of me
Something inside of me said I was a victim of a war
I was a victim of the madness

I guess I lost my connection, I heard you slip away
And then it came in loud and clear, you only hear what you want to hear
And everybody here says 'Sonny boy, you're on your way'.

There's trouble in paradise, the story don't sound too nice
And you just can't sleep at night in a solid gold room
There's trouble in paradise, you never turn out those lights
You just can't close your eyes in a solid gold room.

Baby, you've been looking at the future and I know you think you found it 
Now you wanna make me a hero, put me in a shiny suit 
Now I don't know where to put the blame, I guess everybody needs to have a name
But you never get to count the loot.

There's trouble in paradise, the story don't sound too nice
And you just can't sleep at night in a solid gold room
There's trouble in paradise, too many sleep that night 
They have no pride in a solid gold room.

There's trouble.

Where the warm winds don't blow
And the stars don't seem to shine so bright
Nearly everybody knows, nearly nobody minds.

You've been hanging at the stage door waving at the limousine
It's the same cat life that we use in a graveyard scene
Tomorrow morning you go back to school, acting as if nothing has changed
Well, there's no use playing if you're winning at a losing game.

There's trouble in paradise, paying for everything twice 
Too much half a price a little too soon
There's trouble in paradise, you never turn out those lights
You just can't close your eyes in a solid gold room
No no, you never can close your eyes in a solid gold room.

No no no, there's trouble."

Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven

I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain

They compose and find themselves
In their instant milk coffees

Driving in a plastic seated omnibus
Plastic people's parade's moving
Slowly to the void, to the void

They have tinkered up their own philosophies
Daring not to think too much
Pretending to be cool

Never mind, there might be a deeper sense
Cracking silly jokes for idiots
Living in their trash, in their trash

Hey you plastic people
Proud, please keep flexible
Where do you go when your time is gone
What will you do if the day has come now

A plastic pachyderm could be their president
Lying pamphlets for the people
Would influence their choice

When it's dark, just might see their private moon
Looking like a curry sausage
On a plastic spoon, plastic spoon

Hey you plastic people
Proud, please keep flexible
Where do you go when your time is gone
What will you do if the day has come

What will you do
What will you do
What will you do"
261,Reinhard Mey,Atze Lehmann,TRBCIJP128F1465E99,1975,"Du hör mal, eben ruft mich Walter an, es geht da um die neue Produktion
Also, wir fangen schon am Freitag an, und den Termin für's Studio hat er schon
Und auch das mit den Musikern, um die ich gebeten hab', geht alles klar
Und es kommt auch wieder dieselbe Mannschaft, die 's letzte Mal dabeigewesen war
Und dann hat er sich noch nach dir erkundigt und nach deinem Wohlergeh'n gefragt
Und dass ich's nicht vergesse, dich herzlich von ihm zu grüßen, hat er noch gesagt
Und ganz zum Schluss, als ich den Hörer schon auflegen wollte, rutscht es ihm noch raus
Dass Atze Lehmann sich erschossen hat im Garten, hinter seinem Haus

Ich kann das gar nicht richtig glauben, Menschenskind, das kann doch gar nicht möglich sein!
Das geht ganz einfach nicht in meinen Kopf, das kann ich einfach nicht begreifen, nein
Das sind so Sachen, wie sie immer in der Zeitung auf der letzten Seite steh'n
So zwischen Rauferei'n und Diebstahlsmeldungen. Das kann ich einfach nicht versteh'n!
Und über so was les' ich immer unbeteiligt und fast gleichgültig hinweg
So was passiert immer woanders, so was passiert immer Ander'n und weit weg
Und mit demselben Blick les' ich oft noch die Kleinanzeigen und mach' mir nichts draus
Und jetzt erschießt sich Atze Lehmann im Garten, hinter seinem Haus

Ich kann mich gut an ihn erinnern, ohne je enger mit ihm bekannt zu sein
Mit seinem struppigroten Haar stand er vor mir, ein Monument aus rotem Stein
Mit seinen ausgebeulten Hosen und Sandalen mit viel Platz für fünf Paar Zeh'n
Den großen Augen eines Bär'n, dem Schnurrbart von einem Lufthansakapitän
Und als ich ihn begrüßte, dacht' ich, der hat Hände wie Klosettdeckel so groß
Und als ich ihn am Flügel sitzen sah, spielen hörte, fragte ich mich bloß:
Wie kriegt der Mann zwischen den Tasten seine Finger wieder vollzählig heraus
Und jetzt erschießt sich Atze Lehmann im Garten, hinter seinem Haus

Das bisschen, was ich von ihm weiß, hat er mir irgendwann im Studio selbst erzählt
Zwischen zwei Titeln, und er schien mir nicht der Typ, den immerzu der Zweifel quält
Von seiner Frau, von seinen Kindern, Haus und Garten und dem nächsten Urlaubsziel
Und abends wär' die elektrische Eisenbahn von seinem Sohn sein Lieblingsspiel
Und dass er irgendwann mal Flieger werden wollte, aber dann kam ja der Krieg
Und schließlich kam er, wie wir alle, wie die Jungfrau zum Kind kommt, zur Musik
Und wenn er jemals wieder fliegen würde, dann im Suff aus dem Orchester raus
Und jetzt erschießt sich Atze Lehmann im Garten, hinter seinem Haus

Dann hab' ich ihn noch mal getroffen, letzten Herbst auf der Stadtautobahn
Da fuhr er eine Zeitlang hinter mir und blinkte mich wie ein Verrückter an
Und vor 'ner Wurstbude in Tegel stieg er aus dem alten rost'gen BMW
Und sagte: ""Hallo, alter Freund, ich freu mich riesig, dass ich dich mal wiederseh'""
Dann hat er mir noch eine Currywurst spendiert, und beim Essen haben wir
Ein bisschen vom Geschäft geplaudert und mit vollem Mund noch sagte er zu mir:
""Ich habe jetzt die ganz große Nummer geschrieben, kommt nächste Woche raus!""
Und jetzt erschießt sich Atze Lehmann im Garten, hinter seinem Haus

Du, weißt du, eigentlich geht uns ja die ganze Geschichte überhaupt nichts an
Wir kannten ihn ja nur so eben, ändern können wir ja auch nichts mehr daran
Und doch ist mir, wenn ich dran denke, irgendwie, als wär's Winter, als würd' ich frier'n
Als hätt' ich eben einen Freund gewonnen, nur um ihn gleich wieder zu verlier'n
Als ob seitdem all das geschehen ist, wir beinahe alte Verwandte war'n
Was um alles in der Welt ist denn bloß in den alten Spaßvogel gefahr'n?
Und je mehr ich drüber nachdenk', desto wen'ger werd' ich schlau daraus
Da erschießt sich Atze Lehmann im Garten, hinter seinem Haus"

You're breakin' my teenage heart in two"
272,Carpenters,Love Me For What I Am,TRPTTST128E0791D61,1975,"We fell in love
On the first night that we met
Together we've been happy
I have very few regrets

The ordinary problems
Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes
Have been slowly taking place

You're always finding something
Is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life
Because it pleases you

You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be

And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

If what you want
Isn't natural for me
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am I have to be

The picture of perfection
Is only on your mind
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed

We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life we've made behind
And make another start

You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be

And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free"
273,LOUIS JORDAN,Buzz Me,TRKNDZF128F9330489,1975,"When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me why did you walk away
Can't believe that you don't love me
Thought our love was here to stay

Buzz me buzz me buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
When I say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true
Buzz me, baby
I'll be waiting for your call
If you forgot the number
Come on over
You won't have to call at all

Buzz me buzz me buzz me, baby
You mean so awfully much to me
Buzz me buzz me buzz me, baby
I'm like the ship that's lost at sea
Buzz me, buzz me, baby
You mean so much to me
But when I get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973"
274,Grand Funk Railroad,The Railroad (Live) (24-Bit Remastered 02),TRWZKIJ128F427C9AE,1975,"Up each morning at five o'clock,
Seem like the noon-day sun ain't never gonna' stop.
The work is hard in a railroad yard,
Hey, hey, gotta' make it today to punch a time card.
Workin' on the railroad.


CHORUS
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.


Dirt and sweat, runnin' down my back,
Workin' on the railroad.
Work all day long up and down the railroad tracks.
Workin' on the railroad.
I'm a God fearing man, and with many I stand,
Workin' on the railroad.
And with God we've been working, all hand in hand.
Workin' on the railroad.


CHORUS


Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,
Workin' on the railroad.
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time.
Workin' on the railroad.
Oh, you know, the railroad is a mighty good line,
Come on and ride the railroad, one more time."
275,Sparks,The Lady Is Lingering,TRXGYBV128F148667C,1975,"Every word pronounced distinctly, slowly
There are no contractions, nothing slurred
Unprepared you watch in rank amazement
As she lights her cigarette and stirs
Every motion is complete, no editing of anything
Encouraging, encouraging, and not
the customary bill of fare

Can't you see the lady is lingering (lingering)
This lady's lingering, and you cannot believe the reason why

Every sip is of the smallest quantity
That still denotes apparent thirst
Every question is a means to draw long answers
Play the fool, it doesn't hurt
Splitting, splitting headache coming
Get up early in the morning
Where are the funny phrases
That are always followed by goodbye

Can't you see the lady is lingering (lingering)
This lady's lingering, and you cannot believe the reason why

Is it now all up to you, do you now
guide the evening, or do you await
a further signal, a look, a touch, a sigh

Can't you see the lady is lingering (lingering)
This lady's lingering, and you cannot believe the reason why

Risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering

Can't you see the lady is lingering (lingering)
This lady's lingering, and you cannot believe the reason why."
276,Minnie Riperton,Simple Things,TRENJIS128E0788A72,1975,"If Simon says, ""Be glad today,"" 
I surely do what Simon say,
And if you'd like to see me smile,
Then you're in luck, cause that's my style...

My pretty bird up in the tree, 
I hear the song you sing for me...
The sky's fantastic, blue or grey,
And here we are, alive today...
Hey, hey, hey...

Hey!
The simple things, the lovely simple things:
The sunset and the dawn...
The simple things, the lovely simple things;
I could go on, and on, and on...

For the simple pleasures are worth more than treasures
That your paper money ever bring...

This song is old, this song is new;
This song is me, this song is you...
I like to play out in the rain, 
I like the sun to shine again...
And again and again...

Each day, so many things to see,
And I'm so glad that I am me...
And you, my friends, are pretty too,
And I'm so glad that you are you...
You are you, you are you...

Ow!
The simple things, the lovely simple things:
The sunset and the dawn...
The simple things, the lovely simple things;
I could go on, and on, and on...

For the simple pleasures are worth more than treasures
That your paper money ever bring...

Ah, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-hoo..."

278,Lynyrd Skynyrd,Am I Losin',TRNVSQN128E078F589,1975,"(allen collins - ronnie vanzant)

I recall when I used to come home never had a dime
But lord I always had a good time
And I recall drinkin' wine with one of my friends
Lord, I can't go back again

(chorus)
Am I losin' my own way back home
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known
Am I losin' won't you tell me how I've sinned
Why am I losin one of my bets friends

And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well
It goes to show lord you just can't tell
Now my friend won't talk to me let me tell you why
He thinks I 've changed because of a dollar sign
(chorus)

And it's so strange when you get just a little money
Your so called friends want to act just a little funny
They'll blame you

But I'm not the one that's here to blame
Its you my friend that's really changed
Its a shame, such a shame
Am I losin' once again

Why these things happen, lord I don't understand
But lord it can sure hurt a man
Why my friend won't take me as I am
'cause your friend lord is the most important thing

(chorus)"
279,Eric Carmen,Make Me Lose Control,TRQTPZY128F92F37F9,1975,"I run a comb through my hair and step out in the street
And the city's the color of green when the noon sun appears, oh yeah
Jennifer's got her daddy's car, she's playin' ""Uptown"" on the stereo
We go cruisin' so close, the way they did long ago...

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

We put the top down on the car, with the moon in the sky
And the wind is so hot in our hair, like the fire in July, oh yeah
Jennifer's singin' ""Stand By Me"", and she knows every single word by heart
Was love always this good, or could this be just the start?

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

""Be My Baby"" comes on and we're movin' in time
And the heat from your touch makes me feel like I'm losin' my mind, oh yeah
(And then they play) ""Back In My Arms Again""
(We close our eyes) we start rememberin' when
(We start to kiss) and now the feeling's intense,
And we just pray that this night never ends

My darlin', turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control
Baby, when I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

Baby, baby
Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control

When I look in your eyes, I go crazy
Fever's high with the lights down low
So, take me over the edge, make me lose control

Baby, baby
Turn the radio up for that sweet sound
Hold me close, never let me go
Keep this feelin' alive, make me lose control"
