0,GANGgajang,Gimme Some Lovin',TRPZMOA128F930A336,1985,"Well it's happening again, like I always thought it would

Madmen dancing in the street and fires rage.
And it's a strange infatuation taking off across the nations
Crazy dialling confrontation 'cause it's one more move and it's all over

Gimme some lovin', it's what I need
Gimme little lovin', makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme little lovin' makes me say

It's spreading everywhere, showing here and growing there
There's no time for condemnation ,just to wait.
And it's an eerie indication of things that's turning out to be
Destruction to distraction,
'Cause it's one more move and it's goodbye,
You know why we've got to say, just

Gimme some lovin' it's what I need
Gimme little lovin' makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme litlle lovin' makes me feel like

They fall, again, on the streets tonight.

And we're wakin' up every day , looking this way looking that way
Wondering who will come and end this game
Of one more move and it's all over

Gimme some lovin' it's what I need
Gimme little lovin' makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme some lovin' that's the way"
1,Mike And The Mechanics,All I Need Is A Miracle,TRSLMFQ128F146976B,1985,"I said ""Go if you wanna go
Stay if you wanna stay""
I didn't care if you hung around me
I didn't care if you went away
And I know you were never right
I'll admit I was never wrong
I could never make up my mind
I made it up as I went along

And though I treated you like a child
I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

I never had any time
And I never had any call
But I went out of my way just to hurt you
The one I shouldn't hurt at all
I thought I was being cool
Yeah, I thought I was being strong
But it's always the same old story
You never know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you

And if I ever catch up with you
I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life

All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a miracle, all I need is you (All I need is a miracle)
All I need is a, all I need is a
All I need is you (All I need is a miracle)"
2,Iron Maiden,Iron Maiden (Live) (1998 Digital Remaster),TRONUEB128F147F393,1985,"Won't you come into my room
I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood
I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow
As it pours upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought
Iron Maiden can't be sought

Oh well, wherever
Wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you
No matter how far
See the blood flow, watching it shed
Up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead"
3,Louis Armstrong,Ain't Misbehavin',TRIYNRM128F424BF6B,1985,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you"
4,Lizzy Borden,Save ME,TRLHIEI128F934AC0D,1985,"She's acting like a woman
And you can tell by the look in her eyes
She's still a child
And she tells me
She's gonna go far her own way
And you know, yes you know
It's just a game she plays

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you

Search for what you need
Hunger for the feed
If you crash you soon will burn
Never to return

I couldn't see
My eyes were blinded
Now you're a picture of the past
A cold reminder

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you

Search for what you need
Hunger for the feed
If you crash you soon will burn
Never to return

Save me
I'm not just any fool
You gotta - save me, save me
I'm dying here with you
Yeah, you're killing me babe"
5,Level 42,Eyes Waterfalling,TRGGRKD128EF340A0B,1985,"Let me out to play
Let me find a way - to be
Let me feel the sun
Life has just begun for me

Eyes waterfalling, a world full of tears
Eyes waterfalling, but nobody hears

Laughter all around
It's lonely looking down - from here
Fuel my shallow pride
And teach me how to hide my fear

Eyes waterfalling, a world full of tears
Eyes waterfalling, but nobody hears

They've got control of my life
I can't break away

They've shaped my destiny
No use the boy in me
I go to join my friend
He'll bring me joy again

Eyes waterfalling, a world full of tears
Eyes waterfalling, but nobody hears

I lost control in the night
And drifted away

Eyes waterfalling, a world full of tears
Eyes waterfalling, but nobody hears"
6,Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force,On The Run Again,TRVGEPJ128E0793595,1985,"""Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun

Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay

Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive

Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...

He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead

He's on the run, again...(repeat 4 times)
Tell me when will it end

8,Sacred Reich,No Believers,TRLIKDJ128F934B6CF,1985,"What is this lie there is no truth
There is no God there is no proof
They say there is a higher beeing

The Bible is a lie
I defy the lying priest
God doesn't control my life
I choose me own destiny
Religion is for the weak
Your soul will die forever
Get up off your knees
There's no God in heaven!

What is God, imagination
A symbol of lies and frustration
Your saviour Jesus was lost
When he was nailed to the cross

The Bible is a lie
I defy the lying priest
God doesn't control my life
I choose me own destiny
Religion is for the weak
Your soul will die forever
Get up off your knees
There's no God in heaven!

Screaming prophets
Screaming prophets control your mind
Fake messiah
Fake messiah bathed in lies
Devour Christians
Devour Christians see the light
Do not question
Do not question God is right

Millions of Christians accept in their heart
Their saviour is Jesus have faith in the cross
There is no truth to the holy cross
But millions follow millions are lost

The Bible is a lie

11,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,In The Ghetto,TRMORJJ128F42ACC30,1985,"As the snow flies
On a cold and grey Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto

And his mama cries
Cause there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto

Oh people don't you understand
This child needs a helping hand
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we that blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

And the world turns
And the hungry little boy with the runny nose
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun and steals a car
He tries to run but he don't get far
And his mama cries
A crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto

Oh people don't you understand
This child needs a helping hand
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we that blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

And as her young man dies
On a cold and grey Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto"

To hear sleigh-bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of the White Christmas (du-ah)
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas be white.

I'm dreaming of the White Christmas

Where only the chosen are allowed
There is a boy with the dream of Valhalla
A place in the land of the gods
Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for those who tell in battle
The gods will wake him the moment he falls in the fight
Cause he'll rise when the sun goes down

He raised high his sword
As he cried out Valhalla
His dream has become reality
Tonight he will ride on the road to Valhalla
Chosen to feast with the gods

Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for the mighty young (viking)
The journey has finally come to and end for the boy
He has risen as the bravest of them all

I had a good time
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away
And on the plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday in Marina del Rey

On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina Del Rey
And as we looked into each others' eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina del Rey

Like the ocean tides, highs and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina del Rey
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed 
In Marina del Rey

On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina del Rey
And as we looked into each others eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways

HE PLAYS THE GAME 
HE PLAYS THE GAME SO WELL

He smiles when it buys him favors 
Gives money when he knows he's watched 
Gives love when he wants love returned 
Looks cordial when he knows he's not

Trigger finger on a shaky gun 
His life floats between attainment and death-wish 
Though well-kissed by the lips of fun

Una calle vacía, un adiós infinito
Y una frase de hielo 
Un silencio de escarcha entre los dos
Y un horizonte azul y un tren

Ese tren de la vida se llevó tantas cosas
Se llevó una mañana el sabor de tu boca
Y me dejó sin ti
Ese tren de la vida se llevó mi te quiero
Te quedaste dormido en sus brazos de hierro
Y me quedé sin ti, sin ti

Van cayendo las hojas en el calendario, amor mío
Se ha borrado el silencio
La historia del tiempo que se ha ido
Pero tú no te marchas, te quedaste conmigo
Me acaricias el alma, me gritas
Me hablas, estás aquí
Y yo muriendo hoy por ti

Do you think that you would make up your mind? 
You can't expect that a flower will grow
Until you get around to giving it more
Like it's only

Something to fall back on
Something to fall back on
Something to fall back on

Like a crumpled dollar hidden in your hat
For the subway home when there's no welcome mat
You'd be left with nothing if it weren't for that
When you need to find it it's right behind you

Remember when you were the talk of the town
And you didn't care if I was around
But still you kept me in the back of your head
Just like the teddy bear that you took to bed
I was only something to fall back on

And to wake up lonely is your deepest dread
So you stay connected by a tiny thread
Though you'd rather try for something else instead
When you need to find me I'm right behind you



I know I'm only
Something to fall back on

I don't know what makes me think I've the right
To tell you what is most important in life
But after all I guess I just don't care
And if you need me I will always be there
'cause when I just imagine how it will be
Then I guess it's something to fall back on
Something to fall back on for me

I need to know you'll need me sometime
Everybody needs somebody to fall back on
Fall back on me
Nobody's going nowhere
You can call me anytime
You can fall back on me
You can call on me
I'm waiting on you babe
When your world is falling down
And there's no one else around
And you're sitting, waiting by the phone
You can call me and I won't leave you alone"

He went out in the woods and he never came back
Equipped with a stick and a big old sack
He went too close to the railroad track

You know what they say about Medicine Jack
He lived his life in a rolldown shack,
The wind a-screeching through the cracks
And the sound of the trains from the railroad track

Well here's the truth about Medicine Jack
He painted his face and his whole shack black
He went up in the woods and he never came back
He must have got too close to the railroad track

Did you see him on that fateful night ?
Did you see his grizzly face in the torchlight ?
Did you see him crawling down among the trees
And getting scabs on his hands and knees ?
Did you see the demise of Medicine Jack
His pitiful face still painted black
Just a spit and a stride from the rolldown shack
Down on by the railroad track ?
Don't turn your back on Medicine Jack !

I was thinking about the ghost of Medicine Jack
On starless nights when the sky is black
I can hear him singing those deadman's blues
And whistling down by the railroad track"

They ride through the dark of the night.
Metal warrior stands over victims whose hands
Grab for their last chance of life.

Bright shields! sharp swords!
March forward for their Lord.
Set the bow, rulers come
Meet your maker.
Battle cries! silent screams!
Submerge the Devil in evil dreams
Feel the blade, rulers come
Meet your maker.

I live for the kill, I do it at will
Let the weak ride back to the lair.
Now they will kneel to leather and steel
Gasp for the last breath of air.

Blood runs! heads roll!
Enemy fear, take the soul
Set the bow, rulers come
Meet your maker.
Lash out! strike first!
Blood of the dead quench my thirst
Feel the pain, rulers come
Meet your maker.

A gilded warrior wonders why...
His fear becomes new life on high...
Looking down... the dead won't tell.
Why his soul existence lives on in Hell.
Long live the spirit...!
In a life that knows no end...
Many pass before him...
Many in the wind."

Uh-huh, huh, huh, mm mmm

...Mm mmm

Yes yes y'all

The best y'all, yes yes y'all

Huh, huh, huh, huh... yes y'all

If I ruled the world, was king on the throne

I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home

I'm not runnin, for Congress or the President

I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went

You see - first it was a dream, I was livin in Rome

And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home

And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention

Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions

It took a few years 'fore the day had come

But I was ruler of the WORLD ranked number one

So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown

Let the whole world know that, the King was in town

As I, arrived, the crowd started to cheer

And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""

So I headed toward stage, to make a speech

About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

If I ruled the world...

Huh-huh, huh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

I'd love all the girls... I love em love em baby!!

Black diamonds and pearls... ooh yeahh yeahh

If I ruled the world...

People started flowin as they reached for my hand

I said, ""Thank you for bringin me to the Promised Land

But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody

Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""

And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party

I was dancin to the beat and entertainin La-Di-Da-Di

The music started endin, it was time for a speech

The crowd started sittin as I rose from my feet

And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd

But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud

Excuse me please, for stoppin this show

I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so

My first day in office, the King on the throne

I spent my first three hours on the telephone

You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too

I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do

You know out that office I continued to work

I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt

Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing

Cause there's nothin in the world like bein number one KING!

If I ruled the world...

Huh huh huh huh, huh-huh huh-huh

I'd love all the girls... I love em love em baby!!

Black diamonds and pearls... ooh yeahh yeahh

If I ruled the world... whoawowaahhhyeahhhhhhhh

...If I ruled the world

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit

Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top

And I'm rollin with folks that could never be stopped

And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong

And to you sucker MC's that sing my song

And it's a song that's STRONG about right and wrong

And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long

And it's a song about love, and happiness

In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh

Now I'm the KING, and I want you to know

That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's runnin the show

And to all of you rappers in every country

You better stop what you're doin, and listen to me

Cause we gotta stop war, and use unity

To fight crime and hunger and poverty

Cause the African baby is dyin overseas

While you sucker mission politicians bustin out Z's

Huh, twenty million people all unemployed

While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd

While the working class just struggles hard

Try to make ends meet against all odds

While the poor man can't even deal with life

You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe

And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way

Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day

So LISTEN UP world, while I teach this class

And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last

Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution

Of woman and man to just join the revolution

That'll take your brain to a higher plane

And help you deal in a world that's gone insane

With the problems that I know we can stop

From the ruler of the world and the man on top

But the years went by, and time was up

And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck

And all the people at the time who said they were my friends

Didn't know me when my job had come to an end

They came up to my face, as happy as can be

He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali

So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door

On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

If I ruled the world...

A-huh-huh-huh, a-huh-huh-huh

I'd love all the girls... I love em love em baby!!

Black diamonds and pearls... ooh yeahh yeahh

If I ruled the world... yeahhhhhhhh

If I ruled the world... if I ruled the world

I'd love all the girls... I'd love em love em baby!!

Black diamonds and pearls... ooh yeahh yeahh, oh yeah yeah

If I ruled the world... whoahahayeahhhhhhhh

If I ruled the world... yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah

Yea yea yea, yea yea yea

I'd love all the girls... you know I'd love em love em baby!!

Black diamonds and pearls... ooh yeahh yeahh, oh yeah yeah

If I ruled the world... yeayeah yeayeah baby babyyyyyyy

If I ruled the world... if I ruled the world...

I'd love all the girls... yes you, you, you and you

Black diamons and pearls... where those diamonds, where those pearls?

If I ruled the world...

Huh-huh, huh-huh, a-heh-heh-huh-huh

If I ruled the world...

Heh-heh, heh-heh

What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it, then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender as we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never as good as the first time
Never as good as the first time

Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken next day feathers
The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret

It is a possibility
The more we know the less we see
Second time, second time is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream

It's never as good as the first time
Never as good as the first time

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time is not quite what it seemed

It's never
As good as the first time
As the first time (never as good as the first time)

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream

Cuantas noches vacías
Cuantos cielos de plomo
Cuantas notas al aire
Cuantas tardes de toros.

Pensando en ti
Y en este amor que parte mi universo en dos
Que llega del olvido hasta mi propia voz
Y arana mi pasado sin pedir perdón
Estas aquí, te siento en cada espacio de mi soledad
Te miro y te sonríes y después te vas
Y cruzas la distancia y yo me quedo aquí
Pensando en ti, Pensando en ti.

Cuantas veces en sueños
Me he escapado contigo
Cuantas veces mis labios
Han gritado te quiero
Cuanto Tiempo esperando
Desde que tu te has ido
Cuantas noches vagando
Como un niño perdido."

Which way will you go
And the end of time

Enemies gather around you
You thought were your friends
Memories of your life
Confused through your head
As you take your last breath
All that's left is your soul
Which way will you go
At the end of time"
47,Stevie Wonder,Go Home,TRYJGOC128F14964C6,1985,"Her parents said, girl don't leave home
But her heart kept cheering her on
She had a real good man, steady job
But the two of them just weren't in her heart 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home 

Long days, short nights when you're on the road
For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare
She said I'll make it on a wing and a prayer

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

She said I've on right to tell her how life should be
Especially when the only one she ever cared about in life was me
But she agreed to go along with my final word 

As fate would have life come around
My world started tumbling down
I lost my family, my friends and job
And set free the only one who stuck with me from the start 

She only wanted to be close to me
To give me the love she knew someday I'd need
But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

Every captain must steer the wheel, not by choice but from the voice

That's in his ear, I have lived long and I've done much wrong

But I've survived through my lies, I'm still here, so all you people

Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on

Yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

Well I felt fire and I got tired of running from the truth



And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool

So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you

I have lived on, yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

There were times I had enough, I almost gave it up

But you reached out your heart to me, look what you've done now

I've become the best, oh, I'm the best I can be, oh, oh, oh

You've returned your love, the gift of love, yes, you gave this gift to me"

Someone ought to warn him 'fore I knock him off his chair

And sound a lot like David Allen Coe

And the bar maid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said, Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke

Yeah, Johny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long, I can't remember
And I can do you every song, Hank Williams ever wrote

She filled this place with her smile
She was the queen
Of an Amazon dream
She made us feel for a while

Was it from spite
Or just sheer delight
You stooped so low
Now I wanna know
Why you killed the clown
Yeah, you shot her down

I watch you try
Try to make that girl cry
So you could be king for just one day
And you said that her smile
Was no more than a lie
Just because she had something, something to say

Was it from spite
Or just sheer delight
You stooped so low
Now I wanna know
Why you killed the clown
Yeah, you shot her down

Was it from spite
Or just sheer delight
You stooped so low
Now I wanna know
Why you killed the clown
Yeah, you shot her down

Yeah, you, you killed the clown
You laughed as she drowned
And it was the only time I ever saw you smile
Oh Precious and few
Were the clowns we all knew
And though they made us feel for a while

Was it from spite
Or just sheer delight
You stooped so low
Now I wanna know
Why you killed the clown
Yeah, you shot her down

you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words

My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of light
I can't slow down now

Out on an open road
Racin' to beat the night
No matter where I'm goin'
I guess I'll get all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up?
It oughta be a simple thing

I can't hold on
And I can't return
It's time to let go
Start to live and learn

I took a one-way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

Alone on the highway now
I'm takin' it mile by mile
I'd rather be a lonely man
Than an imprisoned child

So why do I feel the strain
That keeps trippin' me up
Will it ever be a simple thing

I can't hold on
And I can't return
Rivers will run
And bridges will burn
I can't say just how
But there's no lookin' back now

When everything fades away
And there's nothing left
Then you got to keep rememberin'

I can't slow down
And I can't return
It's time to let go
Start to live and learn

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up?
Well, it oughta be a simple thing

and the dark's crawling
in the streets where the bats fly out to kill
When a wolf's howling
and the death's prowling
when the witches are dancing on the hill

Can you hear the madman shout?
Someone blows the candle out

Standing at the point of no return
the sky's on fire
now it's Satan's turn
the point of no return, no return

When an owl's crying
and a dog's dying
when the forces of evil rule the land
When the pane's breaking
and the ground's shaking
when the gods take revenge on every man

Spider webs stick to your face
Can you feel their tight embrace?

Standing at the point..."

Remember who you left behind

Dont ask me to choose hon-ey
There's such alot we've got to do
Don't ask me to choose hon-ey
Cause either way we stand to lose

It's a risk weve got to take
Though it could prove a grave mistake
Honesty when love may break
The very least it will just change its shape
And by the end maybe it's too late
And by the end maybe I will hate you

And don't you know you

There isn't heart enough on you
Do you no longer care or feel that
You have nothing left to prove?

No chains on me, independence is my style
But tonight I'll be your fool

When I lost you I suffered and you were sanctified
We are all born to live, we are all bound to die.

Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will fall and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow you'll carry me not
My heart is bound, my soul is chained to the rock.

Rock of ages cleft for me
I swung down my hammer out in Joshua Tree
It rang on the mountain and rolled to the sea
And it will ring from the rock.

Oh, my children sorrow shall come to each of us
All our trials will soon lay buried in the dust
Long forgotten but quick as silver turns to rust
Love is found when the heart is lost.

Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will fall and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow you'll carry me not
My heart is bound, my soul is chained to the rock.

He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
The queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
""And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
""But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
""Only first I am asking you why""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
""But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
""And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
""And now will you tell me why?""

The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
""It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
""As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
""But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
""To get all I deserve and to give all I can
""And to love a young woman who I don't understand
""Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on"

When they do unto you to do right
Put the heart on in your life

There is only one love in your lifetime
There is only one lover can only do right
When they love you until the daylight

Don't you shave your legs
Don't you double comb your hair
Don't powder puff
Just leave it rough
I like your fingers bare.
When the night comes down
I can turn it round
I can take you anywhere.
I don't need love
Forget that stuff
You know that I don't care

I need a man...
I need a man...

I don't need a heartbreaker
Fifty-faced trouble maker
Two timing time taker
Dirty little money maker
Muscle bound cheap skate
Low down woman hater
Triple crossing double dater
Yella bellied alligator...

Hands and hearts
Separates the loving
Waiting hearts and hands
Two upon her left hand
Two upon her right
Says let's get it right get it straight
And he, he will protect her
And she, will she reject her?
And three, three will be bound together
She lost a trusted mentor
Beloved girl hold up a broken centre
Who let a booted army enter
Tread the tender flesh and tender
Hope in the payment and faith in the lender

Three place cloth over her eyes
And four bolds her down
And five loosens the ties
Six takes pictures of her body as it lies
And she lies
She lies behing the wailing wall

Poison comes in words across the sea
Word from home, leave you alone
Just more baggage for you
Take off her red shoes and show her to me
Take off her blue skirt and show her to me
She led the way, made her own way
The balance restored, the payment received
The rain their course right through her
Rain in all directions, home in all directions
Oh and she thanks no one
And no one thanks her
He was was not her keeper
And she, sche could not reach her
She builts a wall that wailed
She builts a tall wall that failed"

On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun, yeah, mmm

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
""In the name of God my father I'll fly.""

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

With a tape machine and a face of fear

I thought, this boy really thinks I'm a star
I answered him with humility
And then asked him if he'd like some tea

Interview, who's interviewing who
Are you interviewing me
Or am I interviewing you

He asked if the rug was some ancient, lovely thing
I lied and said 'Yes a gift from a king'
I watched his arms and how his lips moved
He asked me if my parents approved
He asked to see my Ruby ring
And if as a child I had liked to sing

Interview, who's interviewing who
Are you interviewing me
Or am I interviewing you

I said yes, Oh yes 400 times
'You've so open'he said 'So you always tell the truth?'
'Never,'I said, 'That's that?'

But how would it feel to hold me in your arms
You could get to know me down on the farm
Then you could see me as the child I've become
'Cause being grown up can be so lonesome
Baby, how would it feel to hold me now
Baby, how would it feel to hold me now

Well I just couldn't understand it
Oh if I could of changed that, then Lord knows I'd do it now
Oh but there is no going back -
And what's done is done forever 

But you were always chained and, shackled by the dirt -
Of every small town institution and every big town flirt

And I think of what you might have been,
A man of such great promise
Oh but you seem to forget the dream -
And the more you saw you hated

Oh but let's not talk of blame, for what is only natural
Like a moth going to a flame -
You had a dangerous passion

But you were always chained and, shackled by the dirt -
Of every small town institution and every big town flirt

All the things that you might have been - but who am I to say?
Still I wonder -
If it's the cold earth you prefer to lay -
If it's the cold earth - you prefer to stay"

Your voice is a bell that massages my mind

And it makes me sad
And it makes me nervous
And it makes me mad

Because I think about you every night and day
And when I could have asked I let it slip away
I've got to get to know you, but I'm so afraid
Well it's so hard to be a friend and be in love this way

Oh talk to me please, you've brought me to my knees
Only your words melt my twenty year freeze
I've known you so long I've known all along
But suddenly my thoughts of you are so strong

Because I wonder if I'm more than just a friend
Did I really see a fire - or just inside my head
Sometimes I know you just want me to go away

91,Phil Collins,Who Said I Would  (LP Version),TRGKGDW128F92E2270,1985,"I know she says she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would

She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

I'm not the only one, but I'll do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

Tell me, who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
Who said I would (who said I would)

Now she knows when she calls me, I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
And she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would

I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
Highest risk of striking out
The risk of getting hurt
And still, I have so much to learn

Well I know, 'cause I think about it all the time
I know, that real love is quite a prize

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high
I blame it on my youth
Soon enough, I  learned the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

Well I know, 'cause I learn a little every day
I know, 'cause I listen when the experts say
(That)

That a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't
As foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know, it will all be worth it in the end

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)

Sur ses murs blancs de lumière noire, nos ombres enlacées 
Reflétaient comme un seul miroir ses pensées les plus osées 

Et quand j'ai voulu m'en aller 
De ses yeux noirs m'a supplié 
De l'emmener 

Elle avait de plus en plus envie d'une autre nuit oh oh oh 
Mais j'avais de plus en plus envie d'une autre fille 

Quand un an plus tôt sans espoir, je l'avais approchée 
J'étais loin de m'imaginer que j'aurais dû m'en aller 
Et quand un beau soir par hasard, vous la rencontrerez 
Il ne faudra pas oublier que jamais elle ne s'endormait 

Et quand j'ai voulu m'en aller 
De ses yeux noirs m'a supplié

It weren't your mama's angel child

I went to see the doctor the other day, he said I's well as well could be
But I said, ""Doctor, you don't know really what's worrying me""
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my loving all the time
I want to be somebody's baby doll to ease my mind
He can be ugly, he can be black, so long as he can eagle rock and ball the jack
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the time,
I mean to get my lovin' all the time

Lord, I went to the gypsy to get my fortune told,

And nobody wants to show you how

You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender

And when the night is cold and dark
You can see, you can see light
'Cause no one can take away your right
To fight and to never surrender

With a little perseverance
You can get things done
Without the blind adherence
That has conquered some

And nobody wants to know you now
And nobody wants to show you how

So if you're lost and on your own
You can never surrender
And if your path won't lead you home
You can never surrender

As obsolete as warships in the Baltic
I'm driving on a straight road it never alters
And the radio serenades but doesn't falter

You offer infrared instead of sun
You offer paper spoons and bubble gum

Late sky
Like an all night radio station
Without morning
Like stumbling on Pearl Harbor
Without warning

You offer infrared instead of sun
You offer bubble gum

You give me Faron Young, four in the morning
You give me Faron Young, four in the morning
Every mother's son's romantic
Every mother's son's frantic!

Late sky:
The sunset makes a fence out of the forest
But here I am with head inside the bonnet
I've lost just what it takes to be honest

You offer bubble gum

I see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamp light
I've no choice but to follow that call
The bright lights, the people, and the moon and all
I pray every day to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

It was many years ago that I became what I am
I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon
The brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young from a family of means
I have stood many times outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight
How could I be this way when I pray to God above
I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street"
101,Billy Joel,Modern Woman,TRLTWFT128F42674C0,1985,"You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper
With her high top sneakers of Italian design
With a long cool stare, she aggravates the tension
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind

Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual
What if she figures out you're not very smart?
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal
Boy, you got to get it settled, 'cause she's breaking your heart

Don't try to put on an act
You can't do that to a modern woman
And you're an old-fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

She looks sleek, she seems so professional
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see
You want to make a move, but you feel so inferior
'Cause under that exterior is someone who's free

She's got style, she's got her own money
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm
She's got the eyes that make you realize
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm

You've got your plan of attack
That won't attract the modern woman
When you're an old-fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper
It's a strange situation for an old-fashioned guy

But times have changed, things are not the same, baby
You overcame such a bad attitude
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks and nowadays it's politics
And after 1986, what else could be new?

You got to learn to relax
And face the facts of modern woman
And you're an old-fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

She's a modern woman

You got the casual hip
That don't mean zip to the modern woman
She's out making the rent
Don't be sentimental, woman

She's a modern woman
She's a modern woman
She's a modern woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a modern woman"

Heads in a spin

Nothing can stop us breaking through
Finding our way back home to you
Standing alone in the fight
You've never been out of our sight

We're back on the streets again (*)
We're back on our feet again
Out of the night
Into the light
We're back on our feet again
We're back, we're back on the streets again
We're back, we're back on the streets again

Caught in a crossfire
No-one can win
They bled off the power
Our spirit within
Standing our ground
We're digging in
This time round
We're gonna win
The banners are flying high
We're reaching for the sky

There's a chance for me and you

The picture in my mind is very clear
I think love has brought us here

I remember not too long ago
I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart
And I was hopin' there could one day be
Be a chance for me to...

[Chorus:]
Get the love that I'd been missin'
Sometimes love takes a long time
But, wait for love and you're gonna get the
Chance to love - wait for love, wait for love
Ooh my

When you take the chance on love you see
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe
The impossible can be
So hold on tight if you think you're right
'Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
You gave up too easily

Now I remember spending all my time
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine
And I was hopin' there could one day be
Be a chance for me to...

I never stopped believing there could one day be
Be a chance for me to

Of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises
Left out in the end

No pride, taken for a ride
You say I'm the only one
When I look in your eyes
I want to believe you
But you know how to lie

And if you say you understand
I don't believe it
And when you reach out for my hand
I don't believe it
And if you say you take the blame
I don't believe it
And if you say that nothing's changed
I don't believe it, don't believe it

Taken in, taken in again
Someone saw me coming
A fool without a friend
There's one born every minute
And you're looking at him

And if you say you want me near
I don't believe it
And when you're holding back the tears
I don't believe it
And when you swear that you are mine
I don't believe it
And it's your heart that's on the line
I don't believe it, don't believe it

Taken in, taken in again
Wrapped around the finger
Of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises
Left out in the end

No pride, taken for a ride
You say I'm the only one
When I look in your eyes
I'd love to believe you
But you know how to lie

You say you want me near
I don't believe it
And when you're holding back the tears
I don't believe it
Oh, there's one born every minute
You're looking at him

Taken in, taken in again
Someone saw me coming
A fool without a friend
I want to believe you, oh

When you say you understand
When you reach out for my hand
Oh, I wish I could believe you

112,Level 42,Something About You,TRHCJMM128F933BEED,1985,"Ooh...
Ooh...
How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby tonight
Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight

Ooh...
Ooh...
And there's something about you
I couldn't live without you
Tonight"

But come on in, don't be scared
Mad man, he'll kick down the door
Mad man, he'll call you a whore
Mad man, he'll brand you a slut
Mad man, he'll kick your butt!
You pay the bills, I live in your place
I'll do what you say for my dwelling space
I'll do your dishes, I'll wash the floor
Just please don't kick down our jam room door
Mad man, he'll kick down the door
Mad man, he'll call you a whore
Mad man, he'll brand you a slut
Mad man, he'll kick your butt!

Proves again what your mind lacks

hold on to, on to your dream
I want you to shout and scream

Oh - trust in the fire
when the night is cold
it will keep you warm
Oh - trust in the fire
the shadows of darkness
can't do you no harm
so trust in the fire

Get up and stand together
and the heat will last forever
believe me, you're not alone
rock fever's bred in the bone

Tell me what to do
Now the light in my life is gone from me
Is it always the same
Is the night never ending

Tell me what to do
All the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me
There's a smile on my face
But I'm only pretending

Taking my life
One day at a time
Cause I can't think what else to do
Taking some time
To make up my mind
When there's no one to ask but you

The same old sun would shine in the morning
The same bright eyes would welcome me home
And the moon would rise way over my head
And get through the night alone

And the same old sun will shine in the morning
The same bright stars will welcome me home
And the clouds will rise way over my head
I'll get through the night on my own

Tell me what to do
Now there's nobody watching over me
If I seem to be calm
Well it's all an illusion
Tell me what to do
When the fear of the night comes over me
There's a smile on my face
Just to hide the confusion

Taking my life
One day at a time
Cause I can't think what else to do
Taking some time
To make up my mind
When there's no one to ask but you

The same old sun would shine in the morning
The same bright eyes would welcome me home
And the moon would rise way over my head
I'll get through the night alone

And the same old sun will shine in the morning
The same bright stars will welcome me home
And the clouds will rise way over my head
I'll get through my life
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own..."

Your knees are shakin'
Your heart keeps breakin' down

Oh wo
Let there be music
Let there be candlelight
Let there be love
Let there be young hearts
Sendin' up hungry sparks
Let there be love

Like a smile in the Big Boy's eye
He lit a little light
'N brought it all in, in under seven days

He said ""I'm makin' em, a man and woman
I'll let run but before my work is through
There's still one thing that I got to do""

Let there be music
Let there be candlelight
Let there be love
Let there be young hearts
Sendin' up hungry sparks
Let there be love

You wonder how it happens
You question if there'll ever come a day
We'll get your head out of your way

Deep in the heart a' me
The music, it plays the beat
Its like a part a' me is turnin', turnin', turnin'
Don'cha try to defeat it
'Cause I know ya just can't beat it
Somethin' inside a' me is burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin'

Just what are you thinking, you look so forlorn
Maybe you're thinking that I have been untrue
So let me assure you and tell you the truth

I'm not one to fool around

Was not meant to hurt you
I needed somehow to try and find out
How I really felt inside and I know I'm

Still in love, still in love
I'm gonna be all you want me to be
'Cause I'm still in love, oh, still in love
I'm gonna do all you want me to do

Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies
It's something that happened in which I can't disguise
I needed somebody to take me away
From feelings of doubt which in my mind delay

But you've always been the one
And there are days when I know
I should have told you
Don't make me cry 'cause I'm gonna try
To make you believe in me and you know I'm

Still in love, I'm so still in love
I'm gonna be all you want me to be

Who rides the wrecking ball into our guitars?

Looking for America, coming through your schools

Que se habra gastado?
Podria comunicarme
Pero siento tanto la erosión

Cerca de su atracción
Tropiezo con mis manos
Sufro otra mutación
Un color azulado

Algo esta ligándome
Cuando estoy azulado
Quisiera recuperarme a su lado

Azulado
A su lado, cambiaría de color
A tu lado, oh, oh, oh
A su lado, cambiaría de color
A tu lado, oh, oh, oh

Porque algo esta ligándome
Cuando estoy azulado
Quiero recuperarme

Des nuages sur mon horizon

Elle met de la mélancolie
Sur chacun des mots que j'écris
Un nouveau rythme un autre son
Elle met du blues dans mes chansons

J'ai goûté à tous ses poisons
Qui jettent mes rêves en prison
Où mes blessures portent son nom
Elle met du blues dans mes chansons
Elle fait pleuvoir sur mes paroles
Les vieux accords d'une guitare folle
Un bruit d'enfer à la maison
Un pied de batterie dans le coeur
Un raz de marée de chaleur
Elle met l'amour dans mes chansons

Il y a du flou dans ma mémoire
Sur ma musique y'a du brouillard
Un grand point d'orgue à l'horizon
Elle met du blues dans mes chansons

Elle met de la mélancolie
Sur chacun des mots que j'écris
Un nouveau rythme un nouveau son
Elle met du blues dans mes chansons
Elle me fait chanter comme une folle
Les vieux accords d'un rock'n'roll
Je m'sens perdu et j'suis pas beau
Elle me fait fumer toutes les fleurs
Elle me fait rire elle me fait peur

Comme un bout de tissu qui se déchire
Et ça continue encore et encore
C'est que le début d'accord, d'accord...
L'instant d'après le vent se déchaîne
Les heures s'allongent comme des semaines

Tu te retrouves seule assise par terre
A bondir à chaque bruit de portière
Et ça continue encore et encore
C'est que le début d'accord, d'accord...

Quelque chose vient de tomber
Sur les lames de ton plancher
C'est toujours le même film qui passe
T'es toute seule au fond de l'espace

T'as personne devant...personne...

La même nuit que la nuit d'avant
Les mêmes endroits deux fois trop grands
T'avances comme dans des couloirs
Tu t'arranges pour éviter les miroirs

Et ça continue encore et encore
C'est que le début d'accord, d'accord...
Quelque chose vient de tomber
Sur les lames de ton plancher
C'est toujours le même film qui passe
T'es toute seule au fond de l'espace

T'as personne devant...personne...

Faudrait que t'arrives à en parler au passé
Faudrait que t'arrives à ne plus penser à ça
Faudrait que tu l'oublies à longueur de journée

Dis-toi qu'il est de l'autre côté du pôle
Dis-toi surtout qu'il ne reviendra pas
Et ça te fait marrer les oiseaux qui s'envolent
les oiseaux qui s'envolent

Tu comptes les chances qu'il te reste
Un peu de son parfum sur ta veste
Tu avais dû confondre les lumières
D'une étoile et d'un réverbère

Et ça continue encore et encore
C'est que le début d'accord, d'accord...

Y'a des couples qui se défont
Sur les lames de son plafond
C'est toujours le même film qui passe

And I couldnt believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true

You know for miles theres not a telephone line
Theres not a soul to disturb us
Just come and be mine

You never even called me by my name

Spoken:
Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the percfect country and western song
Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama
Or trains or trucks or prison or gettin' drunk
Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me
And after reading it I realized
That my friend had written the perfect country and western song
And I felt obliged to include it on this album
The last verse goes like this here

Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in a pickup truck
She got run'd over by a damned old train

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain
No, and you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me
Well, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name?"

All the reasons I had when the purpose was mine
Now I stumble so fast rolling into the night
Kiss me quick before I land and am broken in two
Keep me on the right track, hold my dreams in tact too 
I get lost in this place - I get lost, yes its true

Quand on n'a plus rien en soi - Quand on n'a plus de refuge 
Quand on ne peut plus fuir - Quand on ne sais on courrir
Noir comme la nuit - Oui, noir comme mon ame 
Noir comme les eaux - Dans lesquels je sombre

Help me I'm sinking so fast into waters unplanned
That I once held onto but have got out of hand
Now the things that I loved are the things I can't stand 

Squeeze me slow before I come to that part of the ground
It's a million miles up and a million miles down
I get lost in between and I wait to be found

Quand on n'a plus rien en soi - Quand on n'a plus de refuge 
Quand on ne peut plus fuir - Quand on ne sais ou courrir

Guess you're still the sweet heart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home
And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind

But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

Well old Red he's getting older, and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know
Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all

But then sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure your gonna know the cost
Cause for everything you win there's something lost

But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair

It happened slow I want you to know  
Her love is true music and it  
Radiates around  

Here comes a new day:  clouds roll away  
Don't ask me, I don't know a thing  
Let's drive to town across the border line  
Her love is true music and it  
Radiates around  

My chance for true happiness  
It waits upon her kiss  
How can it be, it feels so good to know all this  

My heart may break and it might fall  
She is mine and I am hers through seasons all  
Let's drive to town  
Across the borderline  
Her love is true music

Deitados nas dunas alheios a tudo
Olhos penetrantes pensamentos lavados

Bebemos dos lábios refrescos gelados
Selamos segredos saltamos rochedos
Em câmara lenta como na TV
Palavras a mais na idade dos porquês

Dunas como que são divãs

Bastante enrolados sacos-cama salgados
Nas dunas roendo maçãs
A ver garrafas de óleo boiando vazias
Nas ondas da manhã"

Taking the freeway, driving blind 
Just like a loaded gun, he pushes down the hammer 
Hard to fire 

In the embrace of his gasoline lover 
Her sleek body wraps all around 
Turns on the radio, lights up his cigarette 
Takes the lights up, dims them down 
A silent Geisha, the perfect seducer 
Knows someone is waiting too long 

Oh will you be home tonight 
Oh please say tou'll be there 

He's just a kid who loves to drive 
To get out of sight out of his mind 
He pushed the hammer down 
And shot just like a bullet from a gun 

Drunk on the fix of the powerful kick 
As he shoots up from zero to speed 
Has one more drink of the cold liquid courage 
To keep on the level he needs 
Soothed by the sound of the wheels on the ground 
But he won't hear the tires when they scream... 

Oh will you be home tonight

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her 
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm

So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a 
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no

Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

Because there's reasons live in these blue skies

I'll give you diamonds
In the lonely mess where we got our name
Violence is such a good friend
Yeah, it's such a good friend

And they're as lovely and pure as the rain
Rain is made of more than water
As injury is made of more than pain

You want to climb but when you try to climb you see the ladder getting shorter
You want to drink but when you try to drink there's someone pissing in the water

The soul is something they can buy
So ""softly step inside"", says the spider to the fly. ""Nice try""

And every day you're crucified
If you can't look them in the eye, smile and wave goodbye. ""Nice try""
""Nice try""

Vices embraced in times of crisis
Sweet vices embraced in times of crisis. That's all. That's all
That's all"

And children at play
Do you remember

Did we started with two?

Sister and brothers are growing so tall
Strangers and lovers make fools of us all

Where is the laughter
That answer our pain
Where are the sunrise
Laid out in the rain
Can there ever return
All the years I recall

Sister and brothers are growing so tall
Strangers and lovers make fools of us all

If you can hear me I need you right now...

Strangers and lovers make fools of us all"

Money is the road to justice
And power walks it on crooked legs

Thieves and sycophants parade
And where it's made--
the slaves will be taken
Some are treated well
In these games of buy and sell
And some like poor beast
Are burdened down to breaking

Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam
Beat'em any way you can

You could get to be
A big wig financier

Land of snap decisions
Land of short attention spans
Nothing is savored
Long enough to really understand
In every culture in decline
The watchful ones among the slaves
Know all that is genuine will be
Scorned and conned and cast away

So now you're gonna shoot bullets of fire 
Don't wanna fight but sometimes you've got to 
You're some soul survivor 
There's just one thing you've got to know 
You've got ten more thousand miles to go 

Because you're one of the living 
And if we can't stick together 
One of the living 
Who's gonna make it tonight 

Walk tall, cool, collected and savage 
Walk tall, bruised, sensual, ravaged 
It's every man for himself, every woman, every child 
A new breed, ferocious and wild 

And all they want to do is shoot bullets of fire 
They wanna fight and sometimes you've got to 
You're some soul survivor 
There's just one thing you've got to know

The Sea King - to save him

Unsure whether he's dreaming or dead 
Seeing the face that his youth has bred 
Slowly realizing that to him has come
His ancestors' ally, friend only to some

The Sea King - has come to him
The Sea King - to save him

He sees that now his life is safe
His foe Yrkoon has failed
The deed that was to finish him
Has come to no avail

The Sea King - has come to him

To his kingdom he is now bound
The sea around him is his shroud
Age old wisdom has set him free
So to realize his destiny

Y tal vez,

de algún fuego que no fue.

No sé si éste es mi sitio,
si se entiende por sitio el eje invisible
de alguna noria.
Quizá la vida es esto,
esto de ser incógnita inaccesible
contra la historia.

de que sin daño no existe la alegría

And reminded me of the night we kissed
And of why I should be leaving

Into each life, some rain must fall
But if the storm becomes too much for you all -
Don't be afraid to enter my life
I will be there when you call me.

Don't let your pride get in the way of your view
Of how we used to be -


Oh, to you it's long ago, but to me, yesterday,
The passing of time is like the crashing of waves
It wears down on your memory and you can forget
That if it all gets too much I will always be there
For you to call me - if you need to call me.

Into each life, some rain must fall
But when the storm becomes too much for you all -
Don't be ashamed to enter my life
I will be there when you call me."

Ending all possibilities for things to change
Rotting in your empty shell
Writhing in relentless hell
It's death you chose, you chose it well

When I close my eyes and you reveal yourself to me
That's our time, time for changes 
A time for reason 
Something only you can see 
All my life I have waited
For a chance to give a love 
Only you demand of me

Fame and success are poor relations 
The more I get the less I need it
Happiness is an unknown sensation 
My heart has a hunger and only you can feed it

Come on in my dreams tonight 
Show me where to start 
Come on I need to shed some light
I want to sleep on my heart 

In the past for protection 
When someone got too close 
Yet another bridge would burn 
But I can find no connection 
Between the love that you propose and the lessons I have learned

I want to hear your explanations 
You'll never know how much I need it 
I want my tears to pay your reflexion 
Cause my heart has a hunger and only you can feed it 

Come on in my dreams tonight 
Show me where to start 
Come on I need to shed some light
I want to sleep on my heart 

I'm sitting here surrounded my possessions 
Objects that confront me night and day 
The fruits of my material obsession
But it seems the more I earn the more I have to pay

Leads nowhere and I don't need it

Can he lead the way, oh can he lead the way.

Waiting for a chance just in time to live a life.

I really love him but he took my love away - you don't say.
Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me. . .

When you're gonna fall in love

there's nothing you can do about it.
When you're gonna fall in love

don't you beat around the bush.
When you're gonna fall in love

now don't you fry to deny it

When you're gonna fall in love

better let it get to you.

Our love is history - oh yeah !
So now it's over

he's got a heart made out of stone - a cold stone.
Iire learned my lesson

the day I found myself alone - why did you do
Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me. . .
Buni 'em off
burn 'em off
burn
burn
burn 'em off.
When you're gonna fall in love

there's nothing you can do about it. . . .

When it got to lovin' you were never there

All that I could do was dream.
When I need some huggin' you never ever cared.
Why did you have to be that mean?

Gonna burn your letters
gonna burn your letters

I'm gonna burn your letters you were sending me.
Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me -
Gonna burn 'em off
gonna buni 'em off

Gonna burn

burn 'em off.
Our love is history

I'm gonna bum the letters you were sending me. . ."
201,Isabel Pantoja,Dejame,TRWTYLU128F4284F88,1985,"Déjame
Abre las ventanas si es noche de estrellas
Que se pose en mi frente, ese rayo de luna
Que se duerma la noche en mis sabanas blancas.
Déjame
Porque escucho su voz cuando guardo silencio.
Y percibo su aroma flotando en el aire
Y el calor de sus manos abrazando mi talle.

Déjame que me ensaye una nueva sonrisa
Déjame que me invente una nueva caricia
Que si vuelve cansado se la pueda ofrecer.
Déjame que inunden las luces del alba
Sabes bien que le quiero con toda mi alma
Y si vuelve cansado se lo pienso gritar.

Déjame
Déjame recordarlo llenando mi cama
Explorando mi cielo perdido en mis alas
Paseando mis dunas, recorriendo mis playas.
Déjame
Abre bien las ventanas,
Que escuche sus pasos.
Déjame recordar el calor de sus besos
Que se entere la noche
Que le sigo esperando."

Steely bodies on parade
Heavy traffic, roll along
High performance cavalcade
Heavy traffic, rubber burning
All together, stop and go
Heavy traffic, miss a turning
Interrupt the traffic flow

If I ever get to heaven
I'll be sure to go by train
If I make it home by seven
I'll never drive again

Heavy traffic, stormy weather
Monday morning on the road
Heavy traffic, wait forever
Following an overload
Heavy traffic, never-ending
Spitting poison in the air
Metal river, who's pretending?
You won't ever get me there

Their cries are found in me

Stayed up stripped at your command
A silhouette against sky
I see the changing of the faces
I've seen, Betrayed as one gets free

When I'll have you here by my side
And for me to share a thousand dreams with you
So far removed the days
In that Waiting Moon

And like an animal which escaped from the cage
They're hunting you over their holy land
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair
Darkness and night your only friends

One day the chase will be over for you
And you'll find your own peace in the end
Some day you will find a sanctuary
Death!… but so long my friend…

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to kill… again

Look for a safe place where no one will find you
And try to escape from the law
Wherever you are there's a killer behind you
Wanting to get you for sure

To lose the fear that one day he will get you
Be faster and kill him and run
Now you don't have to fear him no more
But in his place another headhunter will come
…run away!!!

He said get out of here nobody wants you here
You smashed his head and the man died

Beating in a row
I wish they go away
I'll say it again

Every time you go away

When you were young
Did you ever fall down
Graze your knee
Want to run to someone
'Cos now that older
I've been falling down
I want to run to someone
But there's nobody around

I can feel the sign
There's a million hearts
Beating in my row

Every time you go away
Think about the things I say
Think about it twice as long
Tell me what's going wrong

In the southern sky
The breeze is so wild
The bridge is so lonely
The reasons that life
Feeling so afraid
Talking about a, two hearts
Beating as one

Alto, biondo, invisibile 
Che bello che sarei 
E che coraggio avrei 
Sfruttandomi al massimo 
È chiaro che volerei 
Zingaro libero 
Tutto il mondo girerei 
Andrei in Afganistan 
E più giù in Sudafrica 
A parlare con l'America 
E se non mi abbattono 
Anche coi russi parlerei 
Angelo se io fossi un angelo 
Con lo sguardo biblico li fisserei 
Vi do due ore, due ore al massimo 
Poi sulla testa vi piscerei 
Sulle vostre belle fabbriche 
Di missili, di missili 
Se io fossi un angelo, non starei nelle processioni 
Nelle scatole dei presepi 
Starei seduto fumando una marlboro 
Al dolce fresco delle siepi 
Sarei un buon angelo, parlerei con Dio 
Gli ubbidirei amandolo a modo mio 
Gli parlerei a modo mio e gli direi 
"" Cosa vuoi tu da me tu"" 
"" I potenti che mascalzoni e tu cosa fai li perdoni"" 
"" ma allora sbagli anche tu"" 
Ma poi non parlerei più 
Un angelo non sarei più un angelo 
Se con un calcio mi buttano giù 
Al massimo sarei un diavolo 
E francamente questo non mi va 
Ma poi l'inferno cos'è 
A parte il caldo che fa 
Non è poi diverso da qui 
Perché io sento che, son sicuro che 
Io so che gli angeli sono milioni di milioni 
E che non li vedi nei cieli ma tra gli uomini 
Sono i più poveri e i più soli 
Quelli presi tra le reti 
E se tra gli uomini nascesse un ancora Dio 
Gli ubbidirei amandolo a modo mio 
A modo mio..."

Others say this woman was possessed 
Just one look at her face 
And it's evident 2 her he was the best (Oh) 

Dear Michaelangelo, color the dreams in my head 
I look at your paintings and I'm with U in your bed 
Dear Michaelangelo, save me from death's invitation 
I'll make love 2 no one unless he's of your persuasion 

By summer's end came many offers 
All of which the peasant refused 
She wanted Michaelangelo 
And no other, no other man would do 
No one could speak of passion and touch her 
Touch her the way that he does 
No one except Michaelangelo 
It was him (life without love) or a life without love 

A life without love, a life without love 
Don't die, don't die without love

Don't you waste your time

They will do what they must do

That vicarious choir
Ever searching for a stage where they might sing higher
And they share
The generous souls
But nothing gets in the way of a story untold

It's not fair
The only intention's to hurt
Always there
The strategy's rumors and dirt

Don't let them make you cry
Don't you waste your time
Trying to find the reason why

With private tears meant only for our eyes
Reactions haunt, be worthy of legend

16 million, I can't hear you at all

Some say that's progress
I say that's cruel

You may be safe in your hemisphere
But there's so much junk in the stratosphere
We got our eyes on the firmament, hands on the armaments
Heads full of arguments, and words for our monuments

I won't deny it, can we survive?

Some say that's progress
I say that's cruel.

226,Joe Walsh,Bubbles (Album Version),TRWUMKY128F423CB44,1985,"Floating on a bubble while the world goes down the drain.
Somebody pulled the plug, the dirty dishes still remain.
And when the bubble bursts that’s the worst for those who play dirty games.
While the world goes down the drain, down the drain.

Floating on a bubble, slipping on the soap,
Standing in the tub insane.
While the world goes down the drain. 
And that’s the rub, reality is so hard to explain.
Meanwhile the world goes down the drain, down the drain.

So I’m floating on a bubble while the world goes down the drain.
Slipping on the soap, running out of rope,
But all and all I can’t complain,
And that’s the rub according to the rules of the game.
The world’s going down the drain, 
When the bubble bursts you might as well drink the cork and pop the champagne.
When the bubble bursts, the world goes down the drain."

Young girls are singing out
Boys are building up to be men

Then here comes the blood last
The father, the mother, the sister, the chain
Sweet inspirations
Or a cold hearted nations baby
The young man, the brothers, the killers explain

You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope
And he's holding out his hand
He sees the Northern Lights
above this highrise land

Oh Jungleland

In the city, get out the city pretty quick
I've got a prayer, I wanna sing it to you
It says, may little children forget the wild things

But no one listens cause nobody cares
When you've got the love drugs
And you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven

Here comes summer, here comes violence
Over your shoulder the soul boy explains
Oh Jungleland
They call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope
And he's holding out his hand
He sees the Northern Lights
above the highrise land

But blood is thicker than water
But blood is sweeter than Holy Lands
Unto the Devil a daughter
When my love sings it's an angel song she sings it

Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back, never look back

My pillow screams too
But so does my kitchen
And water
And my shoes
And the road

I have a gun in my head
I'm invisible
I can't find the ice 

A slug
I'm TV
I hate 

A boy, he was tangled in his bike forever
A girl was missing two fingers
Gerry Ann was confused
Mr. Huberty
Had a gun in his head

And ask myself again
How do they kill children?
And why do I want to die?
They can no longer move
I can no longer be still

And he took him down from six foot to five foot three
Then he hit him fair and square in the do-re-mi
That copper won't be having any family

Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are Billy's bones resting now

'Cause he liked a bloody good fight of course
Went away in an old khaki van to the banks of the river Jordan
Billy saw the Arabs and he had 'em on the run
When he got 'em in the range of his sub-machine gun
Then he had the Israelis in his sights, went a ra-ta-ta
And they ran like Shiites

Don't you know that we need you now
With a ra-ta-ta and the old kow-tow
Where are Billy's bones resting now

One night Billy had a rare old time,
Laughing and singing on the Lebanon line
Came back to camp not looking too pretty
Never even got to see the Holy City
Now Billy's out there in the desert sun
And his mother cries when the morning comes
And there's mothers crying all over this world
For their poor dead darling boys and girls

Don't you know that we need you now

Got plugged on a Thursday
Sick on a Friday
Died on a Saturday

All our secrets get uncovered
And we've got no excuses at all
Cause we're just like

What we're going through
And if we're just good friends
I want to know
Why it feels like it's so much more
Are we just like lovers

Oh

We're just like lovers

We are just like lovers
We got more than we've ever
Dreamt we could discover

We are just like lovers
We are

Hear me holler, I choose a sweet lollapaloosa in thee

Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand"

Endless cup of coffee pack of cigarettes

So many foggy nights of drinking he forgets  

In the diary he keeps he writes against himself  
Can't do it all alone need somebody else's help  
Lately I've been sitting around thinking about it  
I guess I don't deserve somebody to love

When I see you its as if I never had a thought
I know this dream it might be crazy
But it's the only one I've got
Come baby shake me
Come baby take me

Come baby hold me

Even to foreign shores

On all horizons storm clouds loom and roll across the sky
The river bursts its banks and vomits soil into the mouth
As thunder breaks the silence, a young child cries!

Between the night and the days first light the leaders made a pact
To raise the rotting corpse of war and set the wheels in motion
The stage a heaving battlefield would support the final act
While the authors hide in sattelites or forts beneath the ocean

And in this play We're cast as fools
To blindly play By others' rules

Now the dust has settled and the stench completely clear
Then return the victors to claim their wretched crown
But from the fleshheaps of the slain, there comes no cheer
Their game is over, the chips are down

You arrived like a breath from the angel of death
Famine, disease and a life on your knees, guaranteed
When you put them in power"

can it be done?
We're only trying to make life better for our son
all I want is to serve my purpose
can't get past today
will there always be someone
trying to take it away

(Chorus)

Listen now to what I say
to all that have dared
you got to change your ways
I know that you're scared
fear not the Lord is with us
he can save us all
my hope lies in his hands
please hear his call

(Chorus)

The spirit of Gideon
lives in the hearts 
of any determined band
that refuses to be discouraged
by hopeless odds
and fights on to victory
""By the sword of the Lord and of Gideon."""
273,Alabama,A Candle In The Window,TRZJNHM128F428F4CC,1985,"(Susan Longacre/Walt Aldridge/Gary Baker)

There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name

And a candle in the window, a flame against the night
There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window oh its Christmas in your heart, in your heart

Maybe it's just wishful thinking I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve

There's a candle in the window, 
There's a flame against the night
There's candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take lots of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go
There's going to be a candle burning, 
It's always nice to know
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
A simple candle in the window and Christmas in your heart
your heart your heart
A candle in the window
A candle in the window..."

Des envies de douceur

Un sourire, un soupir
Je pars avec toi.

Pour toi, j'irai grimper les sommets les plus hauts
Brûler les soleils les plus chauds
Cueillir les bouquets les plus beaux
Sur un mot de toi.

Quand les soirées d'hiver
Ont une longueur amère
Sur un seul mot de toi
Un sourire, un soupir
Je serai près de toi.

Pour toi, je t'écrirai mes poèmes les plus sots
Changerai de pays, de drapeau
Je ferai briller les diamants les plus faux
Sur un mot de toi
Sur un seul mot de toi... toi... toi...
Sur un seul mot de toi

Et si ton coeur est un soir
Un peu blues, un peu noir
Sur un seul mot de toi
Un sourire, un soupir
Je vais où tu vas.

Pour toi je détruirai le plus grand des châteaux
Sur un mot de toi.

You put your finger to the trigger and you shot my heart.

Eksplozja

Powietrze przybiera kształt rzeczy dowolny
Ja wciąż taka sama w gestach mimowolnych
Żyjemy obok siebie spokojnie do chwili
Gdy gniew rozsadza formy, a treść eksploduje

Eksplozja...

Kto Ziemi rozkaże cofnąć rozżarzoną lawę
Kto stanie na drodze mego zniechęcenia
Do form coraz ciaśniejszych i ich
Przeznaczenia

Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again, he can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh, and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
And again

Out of gas, just my luck, four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world

Were once my own
My heart, how it yearns the flame still burns
But I'm alone
Not a word was spoken my heart was broken
But I still care
So I will just pray and suffer all day
And say a lover's prayer

Some day your eyes will fill with tears
When you need me
You'll think it's too late, but my love will wait
Until eternity
Some times when I'm out and having fun
My tears disappear
But deep in my heart, you're the only one
Oh answer my lover's prayer

A lover's prayer is said, my dear
So you'll be mine
I'll cry no longer, my love will grow stronger
As wedding bells chime
But that's just a dream I pray will come true
'Cause I'll still care
Where ever you are, I'll always love you
Please answer my lover's prayer"

I'm searching for a new gold yes i'm searching for a new gold 

A voice is calling 
Move closer to you - yeah 

Virile young men run down the street in havoc singing 
""I wish to build, i penetrate, i penetrate"" 
Restricted sexuality gives birth to worlds of terror 
And all the time i'm trying to piece new schemes together - help me 

Architects erect erections, monoliths are raised 
I love the swollen mound i love the swollen mound 
All hail the new seed breeding from our hearts and wombs 

And night and day run round in circles following sex instinct 
Push it between her legs and stretch the lips mother relieve me 
Bodies entwined in human tangle at the point of climax 
Shoot forth the new gold and at last reason makes perfect sense 

I'm shooting, shooting forth 
I'm shooting forth the new gold now - ha!"

Could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or lover
That she never had

shakes a conscience to the core

On the fritz

there he sits
on the fritz

He kept his ego there
it was a sad affair...on the fritz
the inner circle knows
and so the story goes...on the fritz
airborne rumors chip away the image
but you knew the stakes were high
first they get you thinking you're a prophet
now they've got you living a lie

(chorus)

So the crowds grew, and their praise did too
and a mailing list sent you money
so they love Jerry Lewis in France
does that make him funny?
it's too late for apologies when trust has been betrayed
now victims of your double life are naming names

He kept his ego there
it was a sad affair...on the fritz
the public's had enough
they've come to call your bluff...on the fritz
small talk breeds where kingdoms come crashing
rumor conquers where it wills
no one hears you, go ahead and cash in
if you don't die to yourself
pride kills

Solange, wie's uns Menschen gibt, den Traum vom Fliegen mitgeträumt
Und kaum hat sich der Wunsch erfüllt, der uns der Freiheit näherbringt

Bedenkt, ihr habt es in der Hand, zuletzt liegt es an euch allein
Dass sich das Erbe Ikarus' nie und nie mehr mit Blut befleckt
Bedenkt, das Glück des Fliegens ist doch eine Gnade, ein Geschenk
Das uns menschlicher machen muss und nicht mit Schuld einhergeh'n kann

I looked for my pussy but my pussy wasn't there
Well, well, well
My cat fell in the well
Oh puss puss puss poor kitty kitty kitty
My cat fell in the well

I got out a ladder and I climbed down to my pet
I saw in a jiffy that my puss was soakin' wet
Well, well, well
My cat fell in the well
Oh puss puss puss poor kitty kitty kitty
My cat fell in the well

The doggone hole by the pump
Once she pushed, and in she jumped


There never was a kitty half as pretty
As the pussy that fell in the well
There never was a pussy that could quite compare with her
Pretty as a picture with her long and silky fur -

Well, well, well, well my cat fell in the well, well
Oh oh oh pussy pussy pussy poor kitty kitty kitty
My cat fell in the well

If you have a pussy that you wouldn't trade or sell
Never let her wander or she might fall in a well
Well, well, well
My cat fell in the well
Oh puss puss puss poor kitty kitty kitty
My cat fell in the well
Fell in the - well!"

Seed of the daughter of man
Who traveled to heaven
To take in discussions
To overthrow King Solomon
Storm spirit
You fill men's hearts with anger

King of the demons
Rides the dragon
Yes! He has three heads
Provoker of rage
The violent way
You changed my love to madness

The magic ring
It was the kings
You took it
To the bottom of the sea
Vanished the king
Sent him to exile

Asmodeus
Asmodeus

He was born for the angels
Seed of the daughter of man
He reigned in terror
Have no freedom
Fiend of a waging spear
Provoker of rage
Violent ways
When will this all end

Take it like a man
The king found his ring
Lost was the power
The demon of rage
Was now in a cage
Never to be free

but living color tends to dull our sight 
Like dynamite 
Just imagine my surprise 
When I looked into your eyes and saw
through your disguise 

If we dare expose our hearts 
Just reveal the purest parts 
That's when strange sensations start to grow 

We are not alone 
You'll find out when your cover's blown 
There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
We are not alone 
'Cause when you cut down to the bone 
We're really not so different after all 
After all 
We're not alone 

Flying high above the sky 
The shadows down below look simplified
A good place to hide 
But on inspection of the dust 
We came upon this thing called trust 
It helps us to adjust 

Just imagine my surprise 
When I looked into your eyes 
I knew right then I'd never let you go 

We are not alone 
You'll find out when your cover's blown 
There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
We are not alone 
'Cause when you cut down to the bone

of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said ""I beg
Your pardon king Yertle""
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
""Silence !"" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see

Yertle, Yertle the turtle...
Yertle, Yertle the turtle..."

She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot

She looked lonely and I knew the cure 
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in there
And give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot

I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She seemed so glad to see me
Lord, I could read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe i said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

Well I reminded her how good it was back then
I said you know it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot

Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot

Chorus

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back that ol' clock
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot ..."

Plusieurs tonnes de boue dans le flot de mes veines
La rivière charrie les fils de téléphone
Avec encore dedans mes appels qui résonnent
La pluie a délavé tous les mots que j'invente
Les oiseaux ont crié pour pas que tu m'entendes
Aux endroits où tu étais y'a des morceaux de glace
Et des arbres en travers pour pas que je passe

Où tu iras je te suivrai
Je te suivrai...

Même quand tu auras fermé ta centaine de portes
Même quand tu auras pleuré pour les enfants d'un autre
Même quand tu auras éteint ce qui brûlait de mieux
Même si tu pars plus loin que ne portent mes yeux

Où tu iras je te suivrai
Je te suivrai...

Même au plus profond du silence
Je t'entends encore me dire
On s'approche du ciel

Nos livres fermés se balancent
J'veux pas tomber tout seul
J'veux pas tomber tout seul

Si tu veux j'aimerai même ceux qui te touchent
Ceux qui ont le goût de toi encore plein la bouche
Même ceux que tu hais, même ceux que tu aimes
Il y a tellement d'eau dans les rues de ma peine...

Où tu iras je te suivrai
Où tu iras...

Je t'entends encore me dire
On s'approche du ciel
J'veux pas tomber tout seul
J'veux pas tomber tout seul

De cette ville floue ne plus te connaître
Encore combien d'hivers passeront sous ma porte
Avant qu'un jour j'ose dire que j'aime quelqu'un d'autre."

I'm ravenous for more

And I'll give you private lessons
On survival in the wild
Leave some permanent impression
Make a woman of a child

How did it all unfold, I'm dying to find out

Now I can feel it taste it see it smell it, it's right under my nose
And I think that I can handle it, although, Lord only knows

And there's questions to be answered on the quiz show deep inside

Spent on the war parade

Make their blood mark on history

Another child killed by

318,David Allan Coe,The Ride,TRHKDTN128F932C992,1985,"I was thumbing from Montgomery
I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dress like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son

Well I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale 
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride

Well he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said this is where you get off boy
I'm goin' back to Alabam
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said mister many thanks
He said you don't have to call me mister mister
The whole world calls me Hank

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride"

A marching band is playing
Her long hair frames her features
Says this is the day for praying
We learn so much in little time
One thing they overlooked
Our textbooks made the fire
In which the missionary cooked
 
We believe the gospel wasn't holy
A picture house in every one-horse town
You can't disown the dream you only borrowed
Remember us to everyone you love
 
On the road into the assumed sundown
We'll be content to stroll
They'll tear the shirt right off your back
Then come back for your soul

Oh you're a terrible child
Hide yourself away

From furnished accommodation with a view and window seat
You swear she really is the best thing that you have ever seen
But your heart is in the wrong place
Cover your face and despair yourself away

Oh you're impossible, James
Hide yourself away

And it's a sin to be a saint
And you're impossible, James

And it's impossible to accept
That she's impossible
And as a consequence you lock yourself away
And it's a crime to be alive and be alone
And be content to be

Oh James
Oh you're a terrible child
Hide yourself away

And in the morning when you wake
Nothing will have changed"

heute ist ein super Tag.
Ich besorg mir einen gelben Schein
und hol die anderen eben ab.

Wir klauen noch einen Kasten Bier
und dann geht es ins Freibad.
Kalifornien liegt nicht vor der Tür
und Fußpilz ist angesagt.
Doch wenn Du genug getrunken hast,
kommen die Wellen von allein
und jeder andere Badegast wird für Dich das Surfbrett sein.

Die Hitze ist gnadenlos, wir liegen faul im Sand,
wir glotzen auf Bikinis und töten Fliegen mit der Hand.

Wie der Adler durch die Lüfte schwebt,
stürzen wir in die Chlorflut.
Und wenn noch irgendeiner paddelt
dann fließt auch schon mal Blut.

Wir klauen noch einen Kasten Bier
und dann geht es ins Freibad.
Kalifornien liegt nicht vor der Tür
und Fußpilz ist angesagt.
Doch wenn Du genug getrunken hast,
kommen die Wellen von allein
und jeder andere Badegast wird für Dich das Surfbrett sein.

Wenn die Sonne sich am Himmel neigt,
sind wir schon ganz mies drauf.
Doch wenn wir eine Nase zieh'n,
geht es gleich wieder bergauf.

Abends vor dem Spiegel sehen wir den Sonnenbrand,
doch wenn das Wetter morgen gut ist,
fangen wir von vorne an.

Eye to eye no conversation
You know what i'm going to say
Eye to eye it's a sad situation
Girl have i thrown it away ?

I was missing you, missing you
I needed someone to comfort me
When you closed the door baby
How could i know that i still had the key ?

Your love never thought that i would lose it
My love won't you tell me what it takes to prove it ?
All i want is your love

It's all up to you girl

I don't want anyone else."

Hearts are beating, keeping time to meet a deadline
Faces pressed against the pane to watch a headline

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them fall

All our ships are sailing blindly under one sun
Sending signals, calling kindly, reaching no-one
Echoes sound the shifting air of empires calling
Hold my hand, the shifting sand of empires falling

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them fall
Oh, we'll stand and watch them fall

We confided, then decided not to follow
All the slogans, taunts and charges, sound so hollow
With open minds across the border, we have waited
But keeping place within this race is complicated

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them fall
Oh, we'll stand and watch them fall"

Their smiles are the keys to the prison
I'll call on the angels, to hold my head softly
They'll always remember . . . Stories of Johnny

Try hard to make my anger go away
Try hard to make my money last the day (no way)
Try hard to keep away the pain
Stop the rain, try hard
Try hard to fly a thousand miles away

Qui faisaient rire les imbéciles,
Vomissait dans l'autobus
De la bile.

Il attendait dans des églises
Quelque chose de doux,
Des baisers, des choses exquises
Sur sa joue.

Sur un piano électrique,
Si tu l'oses,
On peut faire de la musique,
De ces choses.

Ton chagrin sonore
Jusqu'à ce que ton cur devienne un bloc d'or.
Allez chante fort.
Mets l'dedans dehors.
Chante encore jusqu'à ce que t'es mort.

Racontant content ses contes populaires.

No one planned it, took it for granted

I count the hours since you slipped away
I count the hours that I lie awake
I count the minutes and the seconds too
All I stole and I took from you
But Bonny don't live at home, (he don't live at home)

All my silence and my strained respect
Missed chances and the same regrets
Kiss the thief and you save the rest
All my insights from retrospect
