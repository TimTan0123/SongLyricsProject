0,Big Bill Broonzy,Just A Dream,TRLLKZU128F92F31EA,1939,"It was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
It was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not a thing could I find

I dreamed I went out with an angel, and had a good time
I dreamed I was satisfied, and nothin' to worry my mind
But it was just a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not an angel could I find

I dreamed I played policy and played the horses too
I dreamed I win so much money, I didn't know what to do
But it was just a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up, baby, not a penny could I find
Play it man

I dreamed I was married, and started a family
I dreamed I had ten children, and they all looked just like me
But that was a dream, just a dream I had on my mind
And when I woke up baby, not a child could I find"
1,Billie Holiday,Fine and Mellow,TRGVEMP128F42A8262,1939,"My man don't love me
Treats me oh so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

But if you treat me right daddy
I'll stay home every day
If you treat me right daddy
I'll stay home every day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on

Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone"
2,Billie Holiday,Strange Fruit,TRBUJYP128F933144D,1939,"Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant South
The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop"
3,Louis Armstrong,Jeepers Creepers,TRMMTUJ128F424B8CC,1939,"Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get them peepers?
Jeepers, creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh oh, git up
How'd they get so lit up?
Gosh oh, gee oh
How'd they get that size?

Golly gee
When you turn them heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd ya get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize

Jeepers, creepers
Where'd your get them peepers
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where did your get those
Golly where'd your get those
Where did your get them there eyes?"
4,Sister Rosetta Tharpe,This Train,TRTXLMA128F9305D9F,1939,"This train is a clean train, you know, this train
This train is a clean train, I said, this train
This train is a clean train, everybody riding in Jesus' name
This train is a clean train, I said, this train

'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train

It's the prettiest train I ever have seen, this train

But if you want to ride it, you better get redeemed
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train

Hey, this train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, I said, this train
Hey, this train is bound for glory, everybody riding her must be holy
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train

Hey, this train don't pull no jokers, I said, this train
This train don't pull no jokers, ah, ah, this train
Hey, this train don't pull no jokers
No tobacco chewers and no cigar smokers
'Cause this train is a clean train, I said, this train

This train don't pull no wakers, a-ah, this train
This train don't pull no wakers, o-oh, this train
This train don't pull no wakers,
No pop shooter, no whiskey drinker
'Because this train is a clean train, this train"
5,Sleepy John Estes,Fire Department Blues,TRMVPYK128F93191E3,1939,"Now, go call the fire department, for my house is burning down
Now, go call the fire department, for my house is burning down
You know that must be little Martha Hardin, 'cause it's on the North side of town

I see the people is running and I wonder who could it be 
I say the peoples is running, and I wonder who could it be
You know that must be little Martha Hardin, I saw 'em turn down on Wilson Street

When you see the Chief, boys, please clear the street
Now, when you see the Chief, boys, please clear the street
'Cause you know he's goin' down, save little Martha Hardin's house for me

She's a hard-workin' woman, you know her salaries is very small
She's a hard-workin' woman, you know her salaries is very small
Then when she pay up her house rent, that don't leave anything for insurance at all

Now, I wrote little Martha a letter, five days it returned back to me
Now, I wrote little Martha a letter, five days it returned back to me
You know little Martha's house done burnt down, she done move over on Bradford Street"
6,Sleepy John Estes,Everybody Oughta Make A Change,TRRXRWC128F422FBD3,1939,"Now, change in the ocean, change in the deep blue sea
Take me back, baby, you'll find some change in me
CHORUS: Everybody, they ought to change sometime
Because it's sooner or later have to go down in that ol' lonesome ground

Now, changed my money, changed my honey
I changed babies just to keep from being funny
CHORUS: Everybody, they out to change sometime
Because it's sooner or later, we have to go down in that lonesome ground

Now, changed my pants, changed my shirt
I changed babies to get shed of the dirt
CHORUS: Everybody, they out to change sometime
Because it's sooner or later, we have to go down in that lonesome ground

Now, I changed home, I changed town
I changed babies all the way around
CHORUS: Everybody, they out to change sometime
Because it's sooner or later, we have to go down in that lonesome ground

Now, I changed walk, I changed talk
I changed babies just keep from being balked
CHORUS: Everybody, they out to change sometime
Because it's sooner or later, we have to go down in that lonesome ground"
