0,The Chordettes,A Girl's Work Is Never Done,TRJJBRS12903CE6A32,1993,"A girl's work is never done
You boys think we are having fun
Mopping and sweeping up the floor
Uh oh, the salesmen's at the door

Never done, never done
A girl's work is never done

Wash up the windows and the blinds
Aw, heck, the rain, a waste of time
And now the kids are home from school
They're tracking mud from room to room

You think it's fun, it's never done
A girl's work is never done
And now my father's home from work
With fifteen hundred dirty shirts
You think he'd help me clean the house
He says he's tired and knocked out
(Yeah, man, I'm beat)

While I cook, he reads a book
A girl's work is never done

My baby brother's now in bed
Lullaby and goodnight
I need an aspririn for my head
There in the living room, Pop sleeps
That means the dog I've got to feed

Never done, never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done"
1,Faith Hill,Just Around The Eyes (Album Version),TRVZOAK12903CE7483,1993,"Just around the eyes
That's where you remind me
Of someone I left behind me
I'm sorry if I stare
But you must have stirred a memory and it caught me by surprise
But it was only for a moment
And just around the eyes

Something in your touch
Took me back a long way
And made me say the wrong name
I wish I could explain
But if I had to tell you
Where a small resemblance lies
It's something in your touch and just around the eyes
I'm over him completely
I rarely think about him at all
So when I look at you
Tell me, what should I do
With the little bit of him that I saw

Only when you smiled
You could have bowled me over
A memory out of nowhere
That came and went so fast
Don't tell me I still love him
That has to be a lie
Its just something in your touch
And only when you smile
And only for a moment
Just around the eyes"
2,Carmen McRae,I Was Doing All Right,TRGZZXO128F429AE0E,1993,"I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
'Til you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
'Til you came by

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing, yes, I'm doing
I'm doing much better than ever now"
3,Russ Ballard,Dream On,TRTBLTW128F145AF8C,1993,"When I was a kid
I still see what we did
We were always on the run
It would seem
That you had a dream
Then you could be anyone

I remember one day
An old man passed my way
He looked at me and he said:
Boy don't you cry
You reach for the sky
Boy you look straight ahead!Â 

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it
Dream on
That's what I say
You dream on
Till love comes your way
You dream on

And as time went by
As a man and I
Would love and I would hide
Love to me
Was so easy so free
With no concerning, no burning inside

And in one of those nights
In the city lights
As the boys and me, we ran wild
She looked at me
And these words I can see
As plain as when I was a child

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it
Dream on
That's what I say
You dream on
Till love comes your way
You Dream On

So if you love and you lose
And you pay love's dues
And at times love don't work out
Don't you cry, Jack
And don't you look back
You let these words ring out

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you need
You won't regret it
Dream on
That's what I say
You dream on
Till love comes your way
You dream on"
4,Ace of Base,The Sign,TRLTBAY128F92CA4EE,1993,"I, I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you?

I, why do I bother
When you're not the one for me?
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)

I, under the pale moon
For so many years I wondered
Who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?

Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
(Ooh)
Is enough enough?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong
(But where do you belong?)

Oh, oh oh

I saw the sign
And it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you, oh, oh oh oh

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
I saw the sign
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)

(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign"

6,Carl Smith,Hey Joe,TRQTLMF128F934433D,1993,"Hey Joe, where'd you find that pearly-girly?
Where'd you get that jolly-dolly?
How'd you rate that dish I wish was mine?

Hey Joe, she's got skin that's creamy-dreamy
Eyes that look so lovey-dovey
Lips as red as cherry-berry wine

Now listen Joe, I ain't no heel
But old buddy let me tell you how I feel
She's a honey, she's a sugar-pie
I'm warning you I'm gonna try to steal her from you

Hey Joe, though we've been the best of friends
This is where our friendship ends
I gotta have that dolly for my own

Hey Joe, come on let's be buddy-duddy
Show me you're my palsy-walsy
Introduce that pretty little chick to me

Hey Joe, quit that waiting, hesitating
Let me at her, what's the matter
You're as slow as any Joe can be

Now come on Joe, let's make a deal
Let me dance with her to see if she is real
She's the cutest girl I've ever seen
I'll tell you face to face I mean to steal her from you

Hey Joe, now we'll be friends till the end
This looks like the end, my friend
I gotta have that dolly for my own"

Meni se iskreno viÅ¡e i ne da

I want all you women to listen to my tale of woe
I've got some (?) of the heart, I feel myself sinking low

Oh my heart is aching and the blues are all around my room
Oh my heart is aching and the blues are all around my room
Blues is like the devil, they'll have me hell bound soon

Blues you made me roll and tumble, you made me weep inside, lordy lordy lordy
Blues you made me roll and tumble, you made me weep inside
Made me use cocaine and whiskey, but you wouldn't let me die

Blues, Blues, Blues why did you bring trouble to me?

Oh death please sting me, and take me out of my misery"

it doesn't really match your hair.
Did I ever tell you that your breath is worse
than what you wear.

That's exactly what she told him,
at least that's what he told me.
So I guess we could conclude
they're not a happy family.

Love's not what you see
between the legs of the majority.

That's a lovely dress you're wearing,
too bad your figure can't make it work.
When I hear the things you say,
I wonder if your brain can work.

That's exactly what he told het,
at least that's what she told me.
I scream my calls, I lock my doors,
I'm suddenly filled with apathy.

Love's not what you see
between the legs of the majority.

Although I'd like to add
the game in bed is a necessity
to make me happy.

Not on a ledge.

This time.

Sometimes you just blow my mind.
Gonna take it all, gonna change it all for you.
And I'm so glad that you found me,
Yeah, you made it just in time.
Yeah, I'm so glad now - I'm getting delerious.

You're down in the basement
When we're up here on the roof.
You're looking for evidence
When you're living proof.
But we hope you're gonna make it,
Up here.

Sunshine, I just can't get enough of you.
Sometimes you just blow my mind.
Gonna take it all, gonna change it all for you.
Sunshine, don't leave me behind.

I keep getting caught in the rain,
Fooled again and again.
I start acting like there's no tomorrow.
Drowning in a sea of pain and sorrow.

Early morning and as I rise
You won't even open your eyes
You used to love this time together
Now you won't even say goodbye
With the passin' time I've watched you change
My love for you still remains the same
Your love for me used to come so easy
Now it seldom comes at all.

Could it be we're really over
Has all the lovin' gone
Is it fin'lly time to face the hurt
I've dreaded for so long
Tell me what in the name of love
Have I done wrong.

I hope in time we'll find a way
To bring our lovin' back someday
If your new life's not what you expected
Call and I'll come back home
I hate to leave but I've got to go
Don't ask why I'm sure you know
Your love for me I can't share with another
It hurts me so.

Could it be we're really over
Has all the lovin' gone
Is it fin'lly time to face the hurt
I've dreaded for so long
Tell me what in the name of love
Have I done wrong.

15,Life Of Agony,Underground (Album Version),TRWUGHN128F423B66D,1993,"If you don't walk with me, I will walk alone

Hard enough to believe in myself
When I know they don't believe in me
Unwilling to change for society
I'll be who I wanna be

I wanna tear it up, tear it out
Get my aggression out
This is what we're here for, control the dance floor
This is why we're here
I said, this is why we're here

So when will it end, when will it end
When will they comprehend, comprehend
That we will overcome this system
I said this is why we're here

They keep on kicking me down, kicking me down
Tryin' to keep me underground, underground
But did I mention we were paving the way
For the new breed of bad seed
We'll never let up until we hear every voice scream
Screamin' these words, screamin' these words
'Til very voice is heard, voice is heard
They keep on screamin' these words, screamin' these words
'Til every voice is heard...

Calling from the underground!

I can feel it in the air breathe!

Unwilling to change for society

We are the underground
We are the underground"

Where we'd go to be alone

I stood there calling out your name
No one answered just the same
The silence speaks for itself

Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, Lord, I don't know
I guess the silence speaks for itself
The last time you talked to me
I did all the talkin', now I see
You were telling me there was someone else
What I'd give to hear your voice
But I'm not given any choice
'Cause the silence speaks for itself

Well, I've been high and I've been low
And I've walked through the fires of hell
Are you coming back, Lord, I don't know

Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do

The weather changes
Like life changes
Like me and you have changed
It's all about nothing to talk about
Then you're washed up in the rain
I wonder why
I let love die
Just let you slip away
I cry and cry myself to sleep at night
Mm baby baby

I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms

Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do

I've tried to smile
I can't 'cos I'm
Feeling sorry for myself
And I can't hide
What I feel inside
And babe it hurts like hell

I'm never gonna hear the last
About how stupid I was
I'm never gonna rest until I have you
Back in my arms

Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me reeling into ecstasy
Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Send me crying to my room
And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you
But I do

No space or time could take me away from you
Not ever no no no not never
Ain't nothin' or no-one can split us in two
Not ever not never no no

Sweet memories of the love you gave me
Sweet memories of the love you gave me

And I don't wanna miss you
But I do
No I don't wanna miss you

To all tomorrow's parties
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what she gonna do
When midnight comes around
She turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Linens and silks of last night's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around?
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties"

thought I heard the voice of mommy.
Sound as if my parents had a fight,
so I woke up my brother lying next to me.

(mmmmmm)

I wonder why she's making all that noise,
better go and check-it out.
So without trying to breathe only the sound of little feet
we were about to discover what that noise was all about.

And as we opened up the door,
we saw them lying on the kitchen floor.
We were grateful for they both did their best,
but we said: 'Hey, ther must be an easier way to make breakfast.'

(mmmmmm)

breakfast

(mmmmmm)

They both got up real fast
as if they were caught or something (mmmmmm)
And then we understood at last
it was a surprise breakfast they were planning.

Mommy stumbled: 'Later, kids, you'll understand.'
While daddy was busy putting on his pants.
We said: 'We already do, don't worry we'll do the rest.'
So far for our quest, we made coffee, boiled eggs.
We made them breakfast.

The sunshine seeping in
Doesn't mix with the black of
Death's angel looming in

Brutal beatings and name callings
To lose me to this bed
Bruised internally
Eternally
Your praise little gifts you spent your money
And stuffed me with
Didn't amount to anything
The attention i need is much more serious
A kind of weight you couldn't lift
Even if your cheap career
Depended on it
I need someone much more

To be my miss
To be my mistress"

As only a woman's, as only a woman's
As only a woman's heart can know

The tears that drip
From my bewildered eyes
Taste of bitter sweet romance
You're still in my hopes
You're still on my mind
And even though I manage on my own

(Chorus)
My heart is low, my heart is so low
As only a woman's heart can be
As only a woman's, as only a woman's
As only a woman's heart can know

When restless eyes
Reveal my troubled soul
And memories flood my weary heart
I mourn for my dreams
I mourn for my wasted love
And while I know that I'll survive alone

(Chorus)
My heart is low, my heart is so low
As only a woman's heart can be
As only a woman's, as only a woman's
As only a woman's heart can know
My heart is low, my heart is so low
As only a woman's heart can be

Always together night and day
It makes our girlfriends think we're gay
But who needs women when you've got friends?
We're the men!

The men will never let me down
The men will always be around
The men won't argue, scratch, or fight
The men won't say, ""I've got a headache tonight""!

On Friday night we'll all jump in a car
And blow all our money at a go-go bar
Sober up for a week to do it over again because
We're the men!

We're twenty-one, but we act like we're ten
We're as immature as we've ever been
Maybe we'll grow up, but I don't know when because
We're the men!

Drink together
Sweat together
Stink together
Laugh together
Cry together
Live together
And die together!

Day in and day out,
Confused and annoyed
It's all I find I think about,
The voices all around you
Starting to make you blind,
12 o'clock, tick-tock
Come on, baby, now it's brain washing time

Morning will come and you'll still be
Trapped here in your cage,
I'll be gone, I'll be gone far away

The King is dead, long live the fucking King,
There used to be a time
When I'd do almost any single little thing for you
I see you now
And my stomach's balled up in a knot.
I feel the cold knife blade of disgust
In my gut like a shot

You can fuck me and I hate you,
You can hate me and I fuck you,
Isn't that what this is all about?

The future's not all it's cracked up to be,
Bloated in the daylight
Dead eyes seldom see
Your empire's in flames and
Your kingdom's out of power
The Emperor's dead and
On his grave are crushed one dozen
Dead flowers"

29,Kerrs Pink,Kingdom of Nothing,TRRJAGX12903CBA22B,1993,"I was a modern man, I had a future plan
I saw myself doing fine
I had a vision, I made my decisions
But I was a victim of time

Caught in a fantasy, I saw reality
Gazing at me from the stars
But when I turn around, nothing is to be found
Some place is always too far

I was a happy man, joining the caravan
Keeping my place in the line
Founding a family, life in simplicity
Then I was cheated by time.

Beaten by destiny, nothing appears to be
Lasting as long as it takes
Calendar tallyman, here in your wonderland
Nothing is safer than fakes

But I see the pale horizon
In the quiet of the dawn
And the morning is arising
With the daylight of my own
And I feel it's now or never
As the choir starts to hum
It's a hot line, straight to heaven
And my mind is getting numb
And I stand up and I haven
And I stuble and l fall
As I reach out for forever
And the kingdom -
The kingdom of nothing at all

And the morning will surround you
With its everlasting gold
But the colour of deception
Is the demon you behold
And the choir in the distance
Is the screaming from below
And denying their existence
Is confirming that you know
That you're left back with a riddle
'Cause the greatest dream of all
Got you trapped down in the middle of the kingdom -
The kingdom of nothing at all

So come on, we'll- take you on a free ride
Come on, a journey on the inside
Come on, hang on, it's shining in the distance
Come on, let go of your resistance
Hang on, come on, get ready for the inside,
Get rid of you fear"

Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights

At Nervous Time
We roll downtown
We've got scenes to crash
We're gonna trick and trash
We're gonna find some fun

We hit the street
With visors down
With our thermasuits
Sealed up tight
We can beat the freeze
And get saved tonight

Let's stop off at the Metroplex
That little dancer's got some style
She's the one I'll be waiting for
At the stage door

Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights

We take the tube
To Club Hi Ho
It's about dead space
It's a marketplace
And a party house too

Something new
From Charlie Tokyo
It's a kind of pyramid
With a human heart
Beating in an ion grid

A critic grabs us
And says without a smile
The work seduces us with light
Eviva laughs and we step out
Into the blue-white night

Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights

We sail our icecats on the frozen river
Some loser fires off a flare, amen
For seven seconds it's like Christmas Day
Then it's dark again
Then it's dark again

When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town

Man, I ooze that, in the mad degrees
With my crew and shit, honey dip, cool breeze
Can you dig it? (I'm with it) (Butter, now you know)
I know the wig gets the grade out (?)
It's fat or else we'd be out
Copped the rap bats from these cats out on Bleeker
Rejuvenate the plates for my people and they speakers
Nietzsche, Rap, make Anita crutch (?)
Planets wouldn't allow themselves to grow like such
Expressions, sightings, scripting, taught
Finest status quo (?) is being an artist in New York
Tongues be often fought, clothes be often caught
If they call it phat, we just ignore it, like it's pork
Planets got them thoughts bloomin' flowers in the dense
They said that Rap was Venus (?), so we snuck and hopped the fence
Landed in a meadow, glimpsed and saw a shadow
Of brothers with guitars, common sense and puffy afros
Lucks was getting brazed (?), Paps (?) was getting blazed
Feds was crackin' domes, but these cats, they wasn't phased
In tights grips, yet, their lips was talkin' fun
Rhythms and the struggle kinda funneled into one
True funk cannot disguise, because the streets have eyes
Who's gonna revive the (?) vibe
Did it like a Dig Planet, goddammit
To get a good kick it, so get a good ticket and..."

All the things that you do to me

There where I belong

Thus far a long journey through my soul's infinity
It has been a journey far beyond mortality
I have found what I wanted, tranquillity
I'll thrive on evil, eternally

I flew over crystal ground
My existence numb
Over orchards of grievance,
sorrow and tears
This beautiful silence...
calls me now
Black fog devours me but I can see it all
The monument of my past,
the land of seven horizons' before my eyes
I reach the land of spiritual rest

Carry me through the gates

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: ""Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said: ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been!""

Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil finished Johnny said:
""Well, you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

Fire on the Mountain, run, boys, run
The devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said: ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
'Cause I've told, you once you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been!""

Wandering in parallel worlds
Revealing your secrets to (the) bold
Time and space are all one
Supreme ruler, deathless one

Sitting on your throne of horrors
Bearer of the darkest light
Feeling compassion for our sorrow
Endless, greatest is your might

Sing the psalms of the abyss
As five angels perish in the sixth
Scream the end of the god of death
With the angels of the path of the left

Reveal to us the ancient
Of dark evolution we're looking for
Inspirer of a new generation
Symbol of alienation

Prince of darkness I call thee
Bestow thy power unto me
Give me all of which I speak
Make me immortal, set me free

Whose laughter this world should not be

Whose sign we ourselves should not be

Cussed your name
You're just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who'd steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Flora Grey, the gossip of Madison County died with child
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

And a Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

They brought you from the field
Unto your lonely pine box came
Just a preacher, me, and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

He thrashes at the horse's back
Ambition is a bloody game

Horse doesn't want to jump
The river looks too wide
Well, he faces every hurdle
With a nervous state of mind

""Stay with me, breathe deeply
Take three paces back
Turn and make a full attack""

The gods are laughing 
And they're tugging at the reins
But they've taken to their wings
And they hit the bank

Heaven may stone him
But Jean the birdman pulls it off

His finger's on the trigger
His eye is on the clock
He doesn't give the game away
And quickly fires the bullets off

Six hearts cut short
Still dreaming they're alive
Blown 'round in dusty circles
Like an absent state of mind

Who hunter, who victim?
God love America
He surely doesn't love him

Hitching out of nowhere
Lines of traffic knee deep
A chance to stave the morning off
And get some sleep

Heaven may stone him
But Jean the birdman pulls it off

He wears a crucifix
His mother left to him
It's wrapped in chains around his heart
Rusted and wafer-thin

""Don't count on luck, son""
All the angels sing
""Don't need to check the weathervane
We all know what tomorrow brings""

Life is a cattle farm
Coyotes with the mules
Life is a bullring
For taking risks and flouting rules

Who needs a safety net
The world is open wide
Just look out for the card sharks
And the danger signs

Heaven may stone him
But Jean the birdman pulls it off"

Si accusa di vendersi all'incanto chi intanto fa il possibile per render piu' accessibile il messaggio al largo pubblico, a quell'utenza in astinenza di concetti costruttivi la cui assenza crea effetti negativi alla coscienza della grande massa priva di qualunque conoscenza anche la piu' bassa di questo fenomeno mondiale che va sotto il nome di Hip-Hop, filosofia di vita, approccio culturale alternativo alla realtÃ  di ogni giorno: mi guardo intorno, m'informo e torno a raccontare nella forma verbale a me piu' congeniale, quella dell'istinto razionale che mi spinge a commentare, a sottolineare quel che vedo a cui non credo. Usando il rap interferisco e le do e non mi siedo, eccedo la' dove intravedo uno spazio libero d'azione per fare informazione e incominciare a rosicchiare quello che ci viene messo a disposizione dai media, dalla televisione: comunico l'idea e la rima il ritmo sposa... io sono un home-boy e faccio la mia cosa...
Sinuosa si snoda la mia rima sopra al ritmo come prosa, si attacca alla tua mente quasi come una ventosa, tatuaggio indelebile dell'anima ritrosa alla disamina che penetro econtamino... Insemino il sistema come un virus oggi andemico, domani epidemico questo Ã¨ cio' che auspico avvenga: non c'Ã¨ niente che mi tenga frenato, il contrattacco e' iniziato, partito. Di slancio come un fulmine travalico ogni limite che intralci la mia crescita e pregiudichi il buon fine di questa operazione rimica: uso la metrica come una sciabola tagliente e rapida, affilata come una spada, affiatata come la mia squadra che mi segue ovunque vada: ilmio DJ stile, fa ruotare a mille all'ora il vinile intorno al perno, scatena l'inferno sulla terra, dichiara guerra, l'attacco sferra e ti sotterra in un mare di merda... non sono un compagno ma un b-boy in effetto nella casa... e faccio la mia cosa...
Una voce virtuale ad elevato volume che si eleva dal piattume culturale, istituzionale, istituzionalizzato dal poteredi uno Stato colluso che per anni ci ha illuso e ha fatto danni su danni, ma a pagare siamo sempre e solo noi, e i cocci restano suoi... Come buoi trasciniamo l'aratro, bastonati da un bifolco ma l'unico solco che ho intenzione di tracciare Ã¨ quello su vinile, la mia ritmica Ã¨ febbrile, rapida come staffile con cui frusto a sangue chi non segue il mio stile, sputa la bile e non ha niente da dire, traccia un confine tra il rap e il mondo. Io non mi nascondo nel doppio fondo del sistema, studio e affronto il problema, traccio uno schema, dimostro il teorema in forma di poema, secondo il concetto assoluto e perfetto che del mondo tu devi essere la ""causa"", non l'""effetto"", e me ne fotto di chi usa l'Hip-Hop solamente come posa... e faccio la mia cosa..."

You got a plan, you wanna be free
If you think I'm gonna stop you then you don't know me
Cuz I ain't got the strength, I ain't got the muscle
So if you're gonna go then go man, go
I've shown you what I've got, I told you what I know
I'm blown

I hit the ol' sack with my thirteen pack
My head's a whorehouse
Got nothing in my pockets, I can't get out of bed
I just want a hug, I just want a beer
You wanna ride but I don't wanna steer
Cuz I ain't got the strength, I ain't got the muscle
So if you're gonna go then go man, go
You're a little fast and I'm a little slow
And I'm blown

You're looking awesome you're one curve blossom
You want to talk some
But I'm trying to watch the tube and you're getting in the way
You still have your looks you still have your friends
I got a bad poem, I guess that's where it ends
Cuz I ain't got the strength, I ain't got the muscle
So if you're gonna go then go man, go
I'm doing all my tricks, I'm putting on a show
But I'm blown

Seems the votes are all in on my zen Stalin
Now the tanks are rolling
You've finally figured out that it's not all in your head
You got a plan, you wanna be free
If you think I'm gonna stop you then you don't know me
Cuz I ain't got the strength, I ain't got the muscle
So if you're gonna go then go man, go
I've shown you what I've got, I told you what I know
I'm blown"

Thunder comes and the Children cry bad blood
never can change, no one here to blame
bad blood, older than time
followed me down from my fathers tribe
bad blood, making me shake
Running through my veins, bad blood

Too many questions, so many unanswered times
Most times the finger points at me
In my confusion, might slip and cross the line
I'm not to blame for all you see
you can't help me it's in my soul
pray for mercy, nowhere else to go

REPEAT CHORUS :

In my confession, I swear and cross my heart
I stand before you what I am
gunpowder ready, just waiting for a spark
and those before me understand
please protect me, keep me safe
heaven help me, save me from this fate

Swimming hard and fast
against the time
lost in a flood
of ancient fire

But the living gets you down
We want you to act like nothing's wrong
Even though you heard a sound
And then you're ripped right out of the ground
Like a fucking root
Ah, you simply cannot hide 
From the ugly truth
You feel you must be wise
Cause you could find yourself
Among a sea of smiling faces
It's a way I've never felt
Yeah, it kinda flies right into my face
And out the other side
The ugly truth leaves nothing to decide
The ugly truth makes every one of us a liar
Ugly

If you can dig a big enough hole
To bury all your loot
No you still won't be prepared for the ugly truth
No you'll never be prepared for the ugly truth
You simply cannot hide from the ugly truth

With your friends and mine
Sleeping days, living nights
Leaving those past times behind

Say these words if you can
They may never come again
Lift your eyes, see the night
There's no time to pretend

But will you think of the time

PÃ¥ inrÃ¥dan av farfar, som musikalisk var.
Ge grabben ett munspel sÃ¥ spelar vi duett,
Sa' farfar, som sjÃ¤lv spelte pÃ¥ esskornett.

NÃ¤r farfar satt i kÃ¤llaren och blÃ¥ste sig blÃ¥
Blev farmor fÃ¶rtvivlad och faster ocksÃ¥.
En dag nÃ¤r faster trÃ¤ffat en riktig stilig man,
Som kom och hÃ¶rde farfar, blev han blek och fÃ¶rsvann.

Vi Ã¶vade tillsammans, min farfar och jag.
DÃ¥ gjorde jag en visa som verkligen var bra.
Den hade fyra toner och lÃ¤t underbar,
Jag tror att det var ungefÃ¤r sÃ¥ hÃ¤r den var.

Vi tutade och blÃ¥ste med kÃ¤nsla och med darr
SÃ¥ duvorna pÃ¥ taket fick Ã¶ronkatarr.
Men farfar bara Ã¶ste pÃ¥, han spelte som i trance
Och duvorna bosatte sig nÃ¥'n annanstans.

Min farfar, min farfar, det var en mÃ¤rklig man,
FÃ¶r han var musikalisk och trÃ¤ben hade han.
Det stampade han takten med i drill och kadens.
Han hade inga tÃ¤nder och skepparkrans.

NÃ¤r farfar blev fÃ¶r gammal avled han till sist.
DÃ¥ tystnade musiken och allt blev trist.
Men Ã¤nnu, nÃ¤r jag tÃ¤nker uppÃ¥ fÃ¶rflydda dar,
SÃ¥ blÃ¥ser jag i andonom en liten fanfar."

It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing
I know the barricades
And I know the mortar in the wall breaks
I recognise the weapons, I've used them well

This is my mistake
Let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

I've a rich understanding of my finest defences
I proclaim that claims are left unstated
I demand a rematch

I decree a stalemate
I divine my deeper motives
I recognise the weapons
I've practised them well
I fitted them myself

It's amazing what devices you can sympathize
Empathise
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

Reach out for me
Hold me tight
Hold that memory
Let my machine talk to me
Let my machine talk to me

This is my world,and I am the World Leader Pretend
This is my life, and this is my time
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed

It's amazing what devices you can sympathize
Empathise
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall
And I will be the one to knock it down

You fill in the mortar
You fill in the harmony
You fill in the mortar
I raised the wall
And I'm the only one
I will be the one to knock it down"

One day..while I was sipping some groove juice I realised..that in the 
Span of time we're just babies..it's all relative, time is unreal.

We're just babies, we're just babies, man [x4]

Every man's a planet and the props are there to get it
Insects roll together with the spirit in our orbit
Life, it comes &amp; goes and you do not punch a clock
I don't take shit for granted, I think of scott la rock
Also of tyrel and battles at the borders
My cousins in the joint and the homeless grippin quarters
The forests are all shrinking, this deepens to my thinkin
Don't cover up the nappy, be happy witcha kinkin!
Dwellin, yes, you're dwellin as the norm is itty-bitty
Figure eighty-fitty for a smidgen of the city
In the serengetti, be ready for a box
But beware of the shanks and the pistols and the glocks
If your peoples don't getcha, you still ain't off clean
The politicians' mask is worse than Hallowe'en
I write the funky scripts so you know I got to kick 'em
Now tell me who's the vics and tell me who's the victim

[chorus: butterfly]

What is really what is really what is really what:
- if the funk don't move your butt
- and if the box don't make you hot
- and if the cats don't dig the raps
- if your life ain't got no spice
- or if the guns just wreck your fun
- or if some shouts ain't in the house
- or if your crew ain't down with you

[ladybug]
Peace, this is mecca the ladybug and I'm sayin though! what is really 
What if I can't even get comfortable because the supreme court is, 
Like, all in my uterus?!

[doodlebug]
Peace, this is cee-know the doodlebug and I wanna say, what is what if 
You can't walk through your hood with bert, ernie and sesame street 
Mossie trying to give the snuffleupagus.

[butterfly]
My father taught me jazz, all the peoples and the anthems
Ate peanuts with the dizz and vibed with lionel hampton
Now I'm swimming deep in the hip-hop with eclectics
Now do we gots the power or is it getting hectic?
Scribble swings the paddle at the mantel where I placed it
Hip-hop grew from roots but some emcees never traced it
The oldjacks buckwild and some babies bore their fists
But the crew from outer space is here.....SHIT
We grew up digging styles of the fabulous fifth freddy
And scoping out for days crazy legs and rocksteady
Now bleach is in the laundry, same old beats is handy
The label may okay it but radio won't play it
The censors are about so watch your mouth close your drapes
The legs that's in the boots is on the corner, watch your tape
Making papes off the crust, for money and for lust
You're playing out the planets get slammed, trust!
You think it, see it, run it and slam it
They peep it, hear it, lynch it and ban it
It just ain't the haps if they know they can't control it
Your grass be in the joint but they licked it and rolled it
So what? I'm sayin, what?!

[chorus: butterfly]

What is really what is really what is really what:
- if the funk don't rule your cut?
- or if the streets don't dig your beats
- or if my man ain't fifty grand?
- or if the hoods don't think you're good?
- or if your church don't really work
- or if the pigs wanna knock your wigs
- or if the jeeps don't roll with beats

Cause butterfly is..baby, I'm just a baby, man
I'm a baby, I'm just a baby, man

And miss mecca (I'm just a baby, man)

With my lead boots nailed to the floor
Dancing the best that I can
Sweets-took the pain away
I saw a cold death at the end of the line
So I started to pray
Up towards the sky but knew no one would
Answer me. I asked the trees why they
Grew toward the sun. I asked the clouds
And they rained down bad luck on me
Oh my god why hath thou forsaken me
I asked the teachers who taught me rules
To obey. I asked the gaes and prophets
Through time. Came up nothing but
A hole where my faith had laid no
Reason, no rite... nothing feels fine tonight
Crime it was a price to pay
I found the hole world as guilty as I
It took the danger away
Hate-it was so easy to do
You just directed all your anger at fear
And then you follow it through
I went to churches and schools to decide
For me. I went to prophets to plea for
My life. Went to my parents who gave
This dark life to me. I don't need to
I don't want to. I don't want to
Wonder why. If you don't want to
Hear my problems well you can fuck
Off and die. You do not know. Dont
Say you know. Give me some answers
Fpor my life... now got some explaining to do
I've got to come up with solutions in time
Before my future is through
Hope - for my new promise today
Still I got this strane feeling that"

Dann hol' ich meinen Nachbarn ran
Und wart' auf Reaktion,
Das kenn'n sie alle schon.

Sie reden von Rhythmus und Provokation,
Und ich such' mir meinen Sender
Raus und spiel' mit 100 Phon

Radio, ich hab' den heissen Draht zur Welt
Radio, ich spiel dir vor, was mir gefÃ¤llt
Radio, ich hab' den schnellsten Draht zur Welt

Den Ghetto-Blaster in der Hand
Komm' ich durchs halbe Land,
Ich halt' nur noch Ferraris an
Und auf dem Notsitz sag' ich: ""Mann,
Oh Mann so'n lahmer Kahn! Nun zeig mal
Was der fÃ¼r sein Geld so kann!
FÃ¼r'n Flugverkehr ist der doch viel zu schwer!""

Wir reden von Rhythmus und Provokation,
Und ich such' mir meinen Sender raus
Und spiel' mit 100 Phon

Radio ...

Sex ist wichtig
Glaub' es mir,
Denn dabei kommt es dir,
Falls du eine Freundin hast,
Zeig ihr deine neunte Sinfonie
Und hinterher,
Wenn sie dich richtig leiden kann,
Dann sucht sie den Sender
Und spielt mit 100 Phon

Hoes on my nuts just because of my position
Can't fade the bitches that's always bitchin
Love to kick beats, rock rhymes on occasion
Down with the niggaz that the hoes keep pagin
Gimme gimme gimme my gin and super-sak
Then, let me hit the doobie, can't fuck with the rock
Bust one shot if you're (with me with me)
Niggaz swing back don't (hit me hit me)
I can freak freak the funk the funk funk
And hit skins all night if I wanna when I'm drunk
Can't fade the pop pop pop goes the nina
Tha Liks be rockin shows from New York to Pasadena
When it comes to rhymes -- god damn I can rock em
When it comes to boots -- god damn I can knock em
Got mad flavor so do me a favor
and bump that shit it's the motherfuckin Liks!

Verse Two: Field Trip

Aiyyo, I cut like a ginsu, I been through, hell
and back, stabbers get swell
Tossed from my balls
Bitches lick the crush off my balls
Pause, yo

to scatter, nigga this is theory
and my shit is kinda fatter
Stagger, cause I got shanked by a dagger
Yo you can't fuck with the Wild Wild West
I'm a shady ass nigga and I slit you like stress
They say ballers only sport Guess
But that's a motherfuckin lie cuz I got a pair of Levi's
Niggaz rollin thick like a New York steak
Field Trip on the beach (now got your momma on some pancakes)
I know you sayin (damn that little nigga's dope)
I got a loaded tec nine under my motherfuckin coat
Niggaz wanna jack the back, never nope
I stick my gat down your throat, and tell your ass no

Verse Three: Tash

The forty's kickin in I gotta drain my main vein
Got drinks in my freezer bust styles I can't explain
And the name of my group ain't changin cuz it fit us
Hit us, one time, for my cats that ain't with us
On the down low drinkin whiskey in the basement
If a sample won't clear I substitue with a replacement
(One two ya don't stop when it hits two o'clock
You can't buy the alcohol so you drink soda pop
Like that and uhh, it's like that
Sometimes it's like that)

Said a stranger on a train
I fixed him with an ice cold stare and said
I've been havin' those dreams again
In one dream there's this girl I love
And we dance every wakin' breath
And in the other they've thrown me in a cell
And they're tryin' me for her death
I'm only young and young in love
As I hold that girl today
But I'm old and tired and in the cell
And I've nigh on withered away

Y'see my baby' gone away too long
And I'm chokin' back the tears
Disheveled star in a burnt out bar
And I'm talkin' in my drink
She promised me the world and more
How could she do this to me?
And now mine's tumblin' down around
But at least my eyes can see
And those stars in the sky are for me

So as this fagged-out tinsel town
Waves so-long to the sun
I lay here calmly on my bed
And the trigger of my gun
And should that no good woman show up
Dancin' from a dream
I'll squeeze it twice and not think twice
And relish every scream"

Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.
Oh, Lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?

Got my bed, but I can't sleep, because your love I just can't keep
Got a license, but I got no car, I said without you I won't get far
I got a phone but you don't talk just what to say, forget it all
I got burned and lost my pride, I said without you right by my side
Got a job, but I make no pay I said it doesn't matter anyway
Got no girl to spend it on I said without you my love won't go.

You took my love and then you threw it through the door
But for some reason I keep coming back for more
You said you'd always love me, love me, love me.
Those words you said they keep ringing in my head
Revolving round and a bringing me down
I can't replace the memory of you love, I love you.
Got some books but I got no brain, I said I try my heart it's far too late
Got my house, but I lost my home, I said without you I'm all alone
Got my bed, but I can't sleep, because your love I just can't keep

Well the waitress never leaves you with a half-empty glass
And every girl's on the dance floor shakin' her... well
It's a two step, three step, outta step, country mood
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well now everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose

Hey bartender pour us another round, 
We're just get gettin' started don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romanced, last chance rendezvous

Might have been

Pulled into a scheme

Lose a lover's arms
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go

I'm the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way

We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Older than the sky
Stronger than the night is long

Lord of hearts
Leader of us all
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone

Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way

Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know it's more than infatuation
That's keeping this man alive

All those special things 
Don't want to walk around being tied to 
Anyone else's

Strings, strings, strings, strings

I would do anything and that's 
What scares me so bad 
Don't want to live my life alone 
Don't want to go back to what I had

Don't want to spend my life without 
All those special things 
Don't want to walk around being tied to 
Anyone else's

The motorcade came down from Redondo
Assasins on the corner tried to throw you a line
You dirty-mouth comic Rodolfo

The Pope renounced you as the real one
Lazarus decided to rise
The Twentieth Century had only begun
Ladies averted their eyes

John Judnich in the bathroom reading the law
Kitty in the hall with your mother
The girls are sick and tired of your blah blah blah
Some beat-kid said there's no other

I was watching perfect time 
let me share each day with you 
love you thru the sands of time 

Time is precious to so few 
love is rare and hard to find 
Won't you take this hand of mine 
Love and spand the hands of time 

Yes, time is a treasure that we cannot buy 
Time measures a life and I don't know why 
My Love, before I met you I could not give 
Then you touched my heart 
and you taught me to live 
You are the sun, gentle and warm 
You make my life complete 
Give me time to show what you mean to me 

Time is you, don't you see 
I need you to give me time 
To show what you mean to me"

Along a loud and crowded street
Disarray
The vender's broke again
It drives me 'round the bend
Disarray

Planes over the skyline

The east pavement opens up
And I'm left looking up
You say you just can't try anymore
To find what you've been fighting for

Planes over the skyline

Walking through the rain
To a loud and crowded place alone
Grounded to a halt
In a city built on a fault
Disarray

Planes over the skyline"

Through the smoky dim lit haze, I saw him from afar
Moved a little closer just to get a better view
He looked at me and smilied and said ""I'm the one for you""
We've heard one too many over used pick up lines
Give us some credit we're not sleazy, dumb, or blind

Saw another guy right then, his suit was tailor-made
Unfortunately so were his lines much to my dismay
Thought he had me pegged, tried to impress me with is cash
""You'd look great on my yacht"" was the best line that he had
We've heard one too many over used pick up lines
Give us some credit we're not sleazy, dumb, or blind

Over in the corner I saw this one all alone
Looked like Mr. Natural, the kind you would take home
Not like any of the others, this one seemed benign
At least until he opened his mouth ""Hey babe, what's your sign?""
We've heard one too many over used pick up lines
Give us some credit we're not sleazy, dumb, or blind

""The other ones were complete bullshit""

Got fed up, decided to leave after one last drink
Felt a tap on my left shoulder, I started to think...
I can't take this anymore, what will this line be?
That's when he let his line fly ""Hi, my name is Steve""
Where have you been all my life, sweet thing?
Can I buy you a drink, marry you, anything?
We've heard one too many over used pick up lines
Give us some credit we're not sleazy dumb or blind"

Somebody broke into my ride and cold macked it
Yo tip I tell you man the devil's tryin it
But I'm goin to stay strong cause I ain't buyin it
Tonight I'm taking Sherry out, I don't have jack to wear
You know I gots to look dipped in the fresh new gear
Cool I found something so I ironed it
I then got caught up on the phone, oh shit I'm fryin it
Will someone tell me what did I do to deserve this?
I think I'll, pull out my suit for Sunday service
My little brother wants Barney, cool I'm gettin it
Took him down to Kay-Bee, they ain't sellin it
Here we go with the cryin, yo he's throwin fits
My blood pressure's blowin up, I can't take the shit
Finally got what he wanted now he's good to go
Again the ride was smashed, where's my radio?
One time the car was in the shop I had to borrow see...
They had no mercy on the car Leo will kill me
Where the hell can Nicki be? I'm gonna smack her up
I got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up
I need to hit a honey off, Jarobi pass the phone
Pulled out my book of hoes, oh yo Sheila's home
Steady smilin like a mother yo I'm read' to bone
Went down to hon, she's in the red zone
Stressed out more than anyone could ever be
Forever tryin to clear the samples for my new LP
Everybody knows I go to Georgia often
Got on the flight and I ended up in Boston
With all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected 
And to top it off, Starks got ejected

Now her best friend be underssin me
Well I was lovin her by the moon ray
Now I'm tricking on her like Kinte' (c'mon)
Bought a bag of izm from the smoke shop
Walkin towards the car, here come the damn cops
Now I'm station bound for the thai sticks
I bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit
Coach sat me down from the ball team
Cause I was breakin niggaz on the inseams
Some niggaz cross town was tryin to stick me
All I had was shorts, a dollar fifty
Picked up this girl in the hooptie
Just because I rhyme she tried to soup me
Pay for this, pay for that, loot for nails and hair
Who the hell you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?
Go and get a bloody job, then can we look cute
Even if you give me boots, you'll neva see my loot
She wasn't even all of that just another hooker
So I turned that ass away, quick like Chucky Booker
Sometimes you got put the hoes in their friggin place
Just move from in front me with your bati face!

Maybe you can see me
Don't run, move on, catch me if you can

Walk on the face of love, walk on
So long, I'm going to trip you up

And you held your hand in mine
A law of spite and hearsay
We don't mind, they're wasting time

Even if you made me
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes
A diva if you paid me
To be some high class jackass
Licking from your hand

Walk on the face of love, walk on

Even if you made me
Like a goody, goody two shoes
No time to be a lady
This is our space, our place

Be your hope when the water's too deep
I'll share my blanket when trouble winds turn colder

While you're lost in ignorance, you killed a mockingbird
Hide behind your bedclothes, meet in some secret place

Afraid to take a look at yourself, 
afraid of the things you will find

I've got my diesel wound up and she's running like never before 
There's a speed zone ahead on right and I ain't see a cop all night 
Six days on the road and now I'm gonna make it home tonight 

I got a ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive 
I take little white pills and my eyes are open wide 
I just passed a ""Gimmy"" and a ""White"" 
I've been smokin' everything in sight 
Six days on the road and now I'm gonna make it home tonight 

Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye 
And I can have a lot of women but I'm not like some other guys 
I can find one to hold me tight 
But I could never make believe it's alright 
Six days on the road and now I'm gonna make it home tonight 

Now the ICC's been a-checkin' on down the line 
I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind 
Nothing bothers me tonight 
I can dodge all them scales all right 
Six days on the road and now I'm gonna make it home tonight 

Well my rig's a little low, but that don't mean she's slow 
got the stacks blowin' fire and the smoke's blowing black as coal

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

Oh oh

Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on, there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you"

Here I'm bending against the wind
Who tries to rip off the coat from my skin
I reach out to old some and keep it till tonight
I'll bring it to your house, so we can blow out the light

[Chorus:]
Hope, hope, hope keeps me alive
Yes, hope, hope, hope keeps me going

Here I'm sitting by the water
To catch some oranges, the ones you like so much
I hold my hands into salty water
And try not to breathe not to scare them away

Chorus

Here I'm laying down at the beach
And see how the rest of this day is sailing west
I reach into my mouth to rip out a kiss
And throw it against the horizon, hope I won't miss

And it's running out

We quote each other only when we're wrong
We tear out the threads and move along
We can't seem to find common ground
I can see the sand and it's running out

It was only circumstances
But it's the difference that gets in the way
No race is run in this direction
You can't break even
You can't even quit the game

The current drags to the bottom
A hemorrhage that moves us around
It pulls and beckons in a strong direction
High water forever bringing us down

I can see the sand and it's running out
And it's running out

It was only circumstances

'cause where you aim you just might hit 
You can hold onto something so tight 
You've already lost it 

Dragging me down 
That's not the way it used to be 
You can't even remember 
What I'm trying to forget 

It was a dirty day 
Dirty day 

You're looking for explanations 
I don't even understand 
If you need someone to blame 
Throw a rock in the air 
You'll hit someone guilty

In one life has begun 
A work that's never done 
Father to son

There's no blood thicker than ink 
Hear what I say 
Nothing's simple as you think 

Wake up 
Some things you can't get around 
I'm in you 
More so when they put me in the ground

These days, days, days run away like horses over the hill..."

The way she walks could stop a truck
Her mind will put you out of luck
Her eyes will put you out of house and home
She'll turn your heart to stone

She needs no excuses
Takes no prisoners
She knows what she wants

You never say never
The rock told the sea forever and forever
The sea told the sky told the moon told the stars
We've got to stop meeting behind parked cars
Up in the mountains down in the street
Long gone dinosaur with inflatable feet
A polyester wig and a credit card
Tryin' so hard to impress

Let it flow down easy
Let it make you feel good like rock 'n' roll should

Let it flow down easy
Let it flow down easy

Deeper higher set it on fire
Roll it drown it shoot it on down
You've got to be here for that crazy sound

Peeping tom for the mother station.

And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite

Satellite, headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle?

Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite
Rest high above the clouds no resrictions
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about this weatherman's satellite eyes.

That we've been playing forever, 
Too, time may be right to say 'good-bye'... 
My voice is aching, 
I'm tongue-tied, 
And the sounds we are making are so-o-o old... 

Goodnight song, played so wrong, 
Blame the crowd, they screamed so loud so long. 

It's an honest day; 
Take the best of me and then the rest let go. 
In every situation where there's tireless rage, 
Step outside the cage 
And let the real fool show. 
I should have stayed 'round to break the ice, 
I thought about it once or twice, 
But nothing ever changes 
Unless there's some pain...

Was kindness too neglected
On my list of deep regret
In spite of distance unexpected
Can we forgive but not forget

Sometimes I think about you
Some old memories make me cry
Remembering the good times make me laugh
Yeah, yeah
But all in all, I'm richer
For the happy and the sad
And thankful for a season in your path

I guess God alone deciphers
When people need each other most
Who will be the blessed receiver
And who will be the gracious host
And all a servant here can do
Is unto the Lord avail
Content at times to be the wind
And at times to be the sail

If another winter settles
On your shoulder down the road
Without a thought of what's behind us
Let me help you pull your load

Some old memories make me cry
But remembering the good times make me laugh

Caught up in Your presence, Lord as You draw near I am.

Oh I will be waiting, for Your love to come down 
Your tender mercies are the strength that I have found 
My heart is longing now, waiting for Your love to come down. 

Time and time again I've wandered, down the road to anywhere 
Looking for a love unchanging, searching for it everywhere 
Till the day when love came calling, answered my every prayer 
Heaven knows where I would go without You there so I'm. 

Waiting for Your love to come down 
Oh I will be waiting, for Your love to come down 
Your tender mercies are the strength that I have found 
My heart is longing now, waiting for Your love to come down.

Nothing on earth can fill this craving 
I just need Your love, that's why I'm.

He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime
But it's all for show, all for show
Wearing your name and a number or two
When the minute's up, so are you
But everybody knows, everybody knows

Watching the hour from the light in his eyes
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky
But it's lost below, lost below
Turning the wheel of your destiny round
When the motion stops - no more sound
Does anybody care, anybody care

Where's the man, where's the child
Wrapped together side by side
Who can tell you what to do
When Mr. Time has come for you
See the truth, hear the lies
Can there be no compromise
And who can tell you what they knew
When Mr. Time has come for you

Is it a feeling of deja vu?
When he points his finger calling you
Is it illusion? just an illusion
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet
He blows them away as rocks on his seat
Cool as his smile, his smile

Where's the man, where's the child
Wrapped together side by side

And took my shelter in that pain

Untie the knots in my soul
Until I feel the secret unveiling

We're playing these parts

Mic check 1-2, strap it up, load the beat, cock the mic
And your rhyme better be fat, or you might have to fight
Yeah, there's no escape from the terrordome
You know I'm nice when I'm bustin fat rhymes on the metronome
MC's never pass the mic to the Foxxx, cause
Once I bust a fat rhyme, you be a has-was
I beat you down on stage and when the battle's over
You'll be leaving your show in a hearse Nova
I'm flippin the x's three times and I'm back again
See, on my way down stage they had me strapped in
But once I hit New York and they losened the chains
I went and bought me a Tec, now I'm wild, insane
I'm on a hunt for a rapper who wanna turn singer
I got my beat-em-down bat and a itchy finger
So if you're nice with the mic and you wanna flip
I'm the rap bounty hunter and it's time to get yo ass whipped
Yeah, I'm comin from the streets, pop
And please fight back, so you can get dropped
It's time to see who's nice and who can really rap
I smack the taste out your mouth, you wanna be a mack
I'm not tryin to shake the water and wake the gator
But I'ma pass the mic like a hot potato

1 potato, 2 potato, 3 potato, 4
(1 - 2 - 3- 4)

You fly high...
I heard your tape, then flipped the next side lookin for the def side
You couldn't be alright if I erased your left side
Who's wet dried when Treach tried, next died
I'm gonna slide your wet wide, so step side
Any dull raps get the skull caps pulled back full breeze
Blastin your ass back at full speed
Hoes in flow, you know, bimbo
And won't stop prayin and playin until I'm layin up in fo'
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go
I got a solid hip below the belt to make your nuts not grow
Here's to all crews that been wack
I got a thinkin cap with raps I attached with a chin strap
Flash past your girl who's def in the flesh
Yes, you can't believe that she said ""Treach""
The wicked-a-wicked-a-wully-bully
Bad and fully and surely bad
Ready and willy gettin ???? glad
Dissed in hell and fell in fire
I attack your back, force you to retire with a wet wire
Give you the whip appeal like Toby

Take the dough from all who owe me

I tow him in a yoke, grab him by his throat - boom! then I knock him out
I keep heat and keep the clips in my sock
When my glock get hot you punk niggas better leave the block
Yeah, Freddie Foxxx on a rampage
Every time I touch the mic the police is standin front stage
Cause I been labelled as a troublemaker
I send my baddest girl to your house to play the heart breaker
She'll lay you down and put hickeys on your chest
Then turn around and blast you with a .33 shot Tec
You couldn't rap, you was wack from the get-go
So you got bumped off by my head hoe
Called by the Militant Mack, my mentality is jail
Long as I'm strapped I can't fail
Check this, I take the bass and I bust you in the eye with it
A piece of steel with a screen on top, I'm gettin fly with it
I'm bringin suckers to the street again
Cause them same broke-ass niggas ridin on my meat again
Mr. Microphone flipped the beat again
Suckers got caught with the rhyme, felt the heat again
I'm breakin it down, lettin you know I'm never lettin go
I beat your brother down, punk, just to let you know
This is hip-hop, gee, not 'hit pop'
You mess around with the beats, get your boots knocked
I'ma slide, I'm in her when I see you suckers later

Shrimps attempt to get pimped when playin pimp, why
Sleepin with a limp eye
Pass the hot potato, Treach done ???? chop to french fries
Mad as a murder vet, man, it'll hurt a set
Well, to hell with you and your fat-o with the gurtle neck
So ol' golddigger, dig some dirt, there you have it
Want ring or a marriage, go get the carrot from a rabbit
Before I stab him for his lucky foot
Hit him with a puffy hook, hit the hare, now look how lucky looks
I'm not a chip on your shoulder, I'm a boulder on a path
Left a gash, you catch a headache in your ass
Class I'm disrespectin, I won't see you trippin, clown
Shh - when I do, you be trippin, slippin and fallin down
All's left to call cops
When I smack you with a leather wig and make you suckers suede bald spots
Chip-chop, flip the hip-hop, I chuckle
You couldn't knock boots with a muthafuckin knuckle
It's on, what's more, talk and get a boo-boo from your jaw

A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue
They couldn't understand your sense of humour like I do

You're much too kind
I smiled with murder on my mind

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

You have a certain quality, which really is unique
Expressionless, such irony, although your voice is weak
It doesn't really matter 'cause the music is so loud
Of course it's all on tape, but no one will find out

You hated me too
But not as much as I hated you

Yesterday, when I was mad
And quite prepared to give up everything
Admitting, I don't believe
In anyone's sincerity, and that's what's really got to me

Then, when I was lonely
I thought again
And changed my mind

Then we posed for pictures with the competition winners
And argued about the hotel rooms, and where to go for dinner
And someone said: ""It's fabulous you're still around today,
You've both made such a little go a very long way""

The girl from the Wadi Hammamat
Lovely as a green parakeet
I awake alone again
In the desert of my dreams
A fertile oasis I have seen

I cast my voice to the burning winds
Across the dunes Khamsin Khamsin
Bring her to me on desire's wings
On the burning desert wind

She means the world to me
In a single grain of sand
Bring a camel to this man
Perched on a bough her tresses hang down
The girl from the Wadi Hammamat
She is as sweet as a green parakeet

Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream
The girl from the Wadi Hammamat"

And young as the day
Nobody sees things, in quite the same way
Computers and shovels, churches and brothels
Mannequins and skeletons, cities and dustbowls

Here we go here we go again
Hear the clamour of the feeding pen
New day new way all my friends can say

Cyclone fences in the cybernetic orchard
Miracle drugs, discount bulk purchase
Sacred in the forest, fast food in the kiosk
Cardboard dinners and the saints and the sinners

I don't want to run and hide
I've seen it all from either side
Truth and fiction must collide someday

God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun

Ah, sweet sensation, the oldest temptation
Now throughout the ages, we've been a' turning all those pages
Now each generation you've got to choose a new location
Got to reach out, got to sync up, build up, get up, to a stronger foundation

God knows, God knows, God knows it's been fun

[Spoken:]
There's an old Australian stockman, er, rock band
Trying, but dying
They get themselves up onto their collective elbows
Revert to their sixties instrumentation
And they try again

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
All together now, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if those stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
All together now, with a word she can get what she came for

Ooh and it makes me wonder
(How does it affect you blokes?) Ooh and it makes us wonder
(That's interesting that, yeah)

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'cause you know words sometimes have two meanings
All together now, 'cause you know words sometimes have two meanings

(A lot of words have two meanings
Um, like in this song the word to buy
Buying a stairway to heaven, bought
[pause] oh no, that's brought isn't it
Well, er, there's lots of words have two meanings)

In the tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
All together now, sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

(Miss Given? Just change instruments now. Thankyou very much.
Miss Given ladies and gentlemen. Isn't it nice to have your name mentioned in the song?
Isn't that good. Lovely lady)

Can I change instruments again? Thank you.

Abandoned by some dust devil that died and left it there

The wind digs deep and peels up the skin of the land
The howling current erases the prints from my hand
I know you are a creature of soil and air
If one becomes too heavy the other simply escapes from there

When you unleash the sand and wind
I am suspended by your eyes
Squirming like a beetle pinned
Between the devil and the deep blue sky

The wind licks off the tar paper with sandy cat tongues
Numberless horned bullets lodge in a lover's lungs
At last I see the ghosts which have been with me all along
Spinning on an axis pointed straight up at the sun

When the substance of our life together becomes too much
And you threaten to remove the whirlwind of your touch

Grabbing at the falling sand which held me in the sky"

Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aw shit Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks and
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causing terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
PLO style, hazardous 'cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow spots like Waco Texas

Raekwon:
I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hitting sound, watch me act bugged, and tear it down
Illiterate type asshole
Songs going gold, no doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that carrying gats
But yo, my Clan rolling like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo so represent
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what
And that's one in the chamber, Wu-Tang banger
Thirty-six styles of danger

I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hanging
Bust this, I'm kicking like Seagal, out for justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on

GZA:
I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up emcee troops
I break loose and trample shit while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking danger
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back, giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fucking prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wetting cream, I ain't wetting fame
Who selling cain, I'm giving out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushing roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette, bring the fucking ruckus

RZA:
Bring the motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring the motherfuckin' ruckus

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

So bring it on, so bring it on

So bring it on, so bring it on
So bring it on, nigga"

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock, they'll take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
(I) take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am I crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God, (then) why has he let me go?

As I walk, my life drifts before me
Though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Hallowed be thy name"

I laughed and shook his hand,
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed

Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun
Pick up the pace cuz we're right behind ya black
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot cuz they're pursuing
But it's my stomping groung where herds get blown down
Think I'm gettin caught by beasts youse a damn clown
Check the drums of death as I break what's left
of your face, cuz you're sellin out the rap race
Your family cried as your body lies in it's casket
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun

(Chorus: x4)

Load the clip, bust lead to the head
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead

Real niggaz represent and don't die
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply
I puff a mad bag of buddha
Niggaz be like ""Yo who the shorty?""
I'm bustin niggaz with my six-shooter
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I walk ya
If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggaz get bucked
Cuz I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla
I'm small but strong like that fucking gorilla
A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map
I never gave a fuck, I never give a fuck, cuz I'm all that
I take no shit see, givin the Buck fifty
I even blew your bitch cuz your man tried to stick me

(Chorus)

(Verse Three: Tek)

Ahh shit, a personality split
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit
A little bad-ass shorty with no remorse
I kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss?
Another boom blew up the scene
throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag team
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now
Damn, just when you thought it was safe
to come out, with a rhyme, I got the nine to your face
Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real
so I pack more steel lookin for the kill
Hope you're not the picture on my scope, cuz the dread'll

The have bitch ass niggaz in jail washin' my drawers
Hit da floors, and do crazy calisthenics
Then when they try to flip they take a trip to the paramedics
Cause ain't nuthin' worse than a bichasnigga!!!
Talkin' lot of shit, throw a punch and run
I have blood on my knife, and a body on my gun
So listen up son, don't act wild

Full of fear and full of pain

And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down down
Lay with me

I let you in but I don't let go
Pulling you, pushing you
Pushing you, pulling

Opening the tears and the emptiness

So soon winter brings
The first fall of snow
There are secret things
In all the whitest worlds

I can see something in that smile
In the way they play
They're passing down the line
Opening the tears and the emptiness
No danger signs
Features unrecognised
Until now

Time enough when old sensations
Won't remind anymore
Unaware of all the children
Running rings without a care
Joining in their games
When I hear pale horses riding
See them fly as they go
Then I know to free the reins
Of unquiet thoughts"

Gray like stormy skies I hoped you didn't know
All on postcards full of things I won't forget
And now it's coming down that laughing clown is all I ever get

Another second time around I've been running from ya
Another second time around
Another second, one more second time I waited for ya
Another second time around

Couldn't help myself
I felt like everything was gonna pass
It was an awkward time
I hoped it wouldn't, hoped it couldn't last

And I didn't know exactly what to say
About the things you saw me do my evil way
And I know you're lying crying in your bed

Roll the dice behind your shades

You're takin' notes and nothing more
A guy snaps your picture on roller blades

Come on roll the dice behind your shades 
Roll the dice behind your shades 

Safest way to be strange
Roll the dice behind your shades 

Take it to a higher place
Where this world ain't in your face
You and me, Carson McCullers
Take it to a higher plane
Take me where the action ain't
Open windows 
Open shutters

And you're sick to death of the latest rage
Afraid of love it always fades.

Roll the dice behind your shades"

I think I just recalled a time 
It was not the moon and not the wine 
And though you said you were a friend of mine 
I never felt that way inclined 
Oh the days were hot and the nights were long 
I must have sung a million songs 
But all the words just came out wrong 
On the last day of summer 

I tried to walk the line 
Hoped everything would turn out fine 
But I think I fell in love that time 
On the last day 
And then the rain came down and 
Sparkled the signs of the underground 
And the darkness fell all over town 
On the last day 

I think I dropped my guard that time 
I was flesh and blood and grit and slime 
And I think I may have lost my mind 
On the last day of summer 
I think I fell in love back there 
It was tooth and nail it was bones and hair 
And you'll never never know how much I cared 
On the last day of summer 

And though I think I fell that time 
It was not the only fault of mine 
But all I wanted was a sign 
On the last day 
I think you broke my heart that day 
And nothing I could do or say 
Could make the coldness go away 
On the last day 

The winter changes everything 
And the raindrops freeze 
On the signs of the underground 
I wonder will you think of me 
When you look up and see 
There's a full moon over London Town 

I think I was away the day 
When you said you were too smart to play 
And you'd only beat me anyway 
It's funny how I would have stayed 
And you said you were a friend of mine 
But that's not what I had in mind 
I think I fell in love that time 
On the last day of summer 

I tried to walk the line 
Hoped everything would turn out fine 
But I lost the reasons and the rhymes 
On the last day 
And then the rain came down 
And sparkled the signs of the underground 
And the darkness fell all over town 
On the last day"

We had a the same father but different mothers
We keep together like a family should
Roaming the country for the common good

It came to pass one fateful day
We found ourselves down Mexico way
The town, the mayor, the PTA
Pleading on their knees with us all to stay

We'd only stopped for a few burritos
But they told us of the trouble with los banditos
A poor little town in need of aid
My brothers and me had never been afraid

The age of chivalry is not dead
Lonesome nights in a cowboy bed
There'd be a bride for every man
Who chased away the evil gang

Love is stronger than justice
Love is thicker than blood
Love is stronger than justice
Love is a big fat river in flood

The outcome was predictable
Our banditos were despicable
Of blood we lost a dozen liters
A small price to pay for las senoritas

The town mayor was happy but his face was glum
The maidens numbered only one
But there weren't seven brides for seven brothers
I knew I had to get rid of the others

Love is stronger than justice
Love is thicker than blood
Love is stronger than justice
Love is a big fat river in flood

Mother told me I was the clever one
The seventh son of a seventh son
It all ended so happily
I settled down with the family

I look forward to a better day
But ethical stuff never got in my way
And though there used to be brothers seven
The other six are singing in heaven

Love is stronger than justice
Love is thicker than blood
Love is stronger than justice
Love is a big fat river in flood"

Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard 
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride 
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
Oh it's rush hour now. on the wheel of the plow
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow 

Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep
And the mountain is filled with lost sheep 

Ring them bells - for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells - all those who are left
Ring them bells - for the chosen few
Who'll judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells - for the time that flies
For the child who cries when innocence dies 

Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong"

I think about somethin' that my mama used to say to me

You gotta dance with the one that brought you
And stay with the one that wants you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let the moon get to ya
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

He's got his old best buddies and his new best friends
And the girls all give him the eye
He's a good time Charlie and the life of the party tonight
But when I think about another, well I don't think twice
'Cause there'll never be another like him
I know he really loves me and I think maybe mama was right

And stay with the one that wants you

Wait the witches at the feast.

THERE'S TWO LITTLE MEN, WHO ARE KILLING A BOY
THEY'RE TREATING THE BOY, AS IF THE BOY WERE A TOY
EACH ONE HAS AN EAR, TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
THEIR GRIP IS TOO TIGHT, THEIR GRIP IS SO COLD

TWO LITTLE MEN -  ONE BIG AND ONE SMALL
TWO LITTLE MEN -  IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR
TWO LITTLE MEN -  AND I CAN'T SEE YOU
TWO LITTLE MEN -  I'M USING AS A METAPHOR"

Loosen you up a little more than you dare to
Maybe take a ride in my Cadillac
God ain't gonna getcha for that

God ain't gonna getcha for that
He's much too busy with the guys in the black hats
There's nothin' wrong with a man and a woman flirtin' with a honky-tonk moon
God ain't gonna pay no attention
If we're just makin' use of his invention
Come on, baby don't hold back
God ain't gonna getcha for that

I can tell you're the quiet type
Are you new in town or just a little bit shy
Didn't you ever catch me lookin?

260,SKYCLAD,The Wickedest Man In The World,TRCOKKH128F428E949,1993,"I stand here before you the way life has made me
Ill-mannered, foul-mouthed, bad-tempered and lazy
I stare at your world down the neck of a bottle
Every day is a death-ride when I hold the throttle

To the drowning I am water
For your calm I am the storm
I'm the fiend who's with your daughter
In bed well before the dawn
Was I the cat that got the bird?
They'll put the blame on me
Everything was grand in Wonderland
Till Charles Manson came to tea

Each moment's a game and I must play it to win
And if you cannot bear it then you'll just have to grin

All the world is a stage so I aim to upstage you
(""By the pricking of my thumbs"")
Kill me off but like Banquo I'll come back to plague you
(""Something wicked this way comes"")

All martyrs seek their cross and nails
The rebels grail his cause
So I'll just sign away my soul
And forget the buyout clause

""The few who see me through my disguise
Abhore, deplore, hate and despise me
I care not what you perceive
Fall unto your knees""

Jack the Ripper went to Sunday school
With his best friends Mack the Knife
And the blue eyed boy who lives next door
He's a junkie Jesus Christ

Do you think I'll be sad 'cause you don't like me
Well I consider it highly unlikely
Spill the milk but I won't cry
My eyes are watertight like my alibi

Yes I'll love you then leave you for no apparent reason
My names are many, my friends call me ""Legion""
The light that casts the shadows, darker shades of black
That hide the drugged up mugger who will stab you in the back

I'm not the type of angel who fell from divine grace
I'm the one who was so bad he never got there in the first place
The vulture in the wings as the battle flags unfurl
""Pleased to meet you, I'm the wickedest man in the world"""

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye"

263,The Walkabouts,Jack Candy,TRMYSZQ12903D0F045,1993,"Jack Candy was as old as my father 
But still I took a likin' to him 
He said: ""You will be somebody's treasure, 
But no one has discovered you yet."" 

Jack Candy lived on Sky Valley Road 
And that's where he did business I guess 
Some say he sold a suitcase of cocaine 
But he never showed me any of that 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy 

I was walkin' up to Jack Candy's trailer 
When he shouted that I('d) better head home 
The curtains closed as he went back inside 
And I trembled 'cause he wasn't alone 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy 

Some say they took him out to a clearin' 
And made him crawl until he confessed 
Some say they hung him up by his bootstraps 
Some say they let him swing in the wind 

I walked along (the) Sky Valley Road 
And out onto the great northern bridge 
And for hours I stared into the cold 
Sick and tired of denying I loved him 

This is a story that I've prayed to tell X2
About the day they drove him from this town X2

I've lived a lie and I have lived it well 
This is the story that I've prayed to tell 
About a love and how I let him down 
About the day I lost: Jack Candy"

271,Us3,The Darkside,TRLDWOP128F1458073,1993,"Come take a trip through the eye of a black man
Lookin' out at life like he really doesn't give a damn
Feel the hate and anger of a punk gang banger
Mad gun slinger, better yet a worthless nigga
See the ills of life for what they are
Feel yourself pitched back from the world real far
Life is grimmer than it ever was
As your blood simmers you feel your brain buzz
People look at you like you're up to somethin'
You look right back like it ain't nuthin'
Ya don't give a fuck, life is a dream
If you die tomorrow then you won't be a fiend for the green any more
'Cos that's what keeps ya tickin'
And that's what keeps ya stickin' if not for that ya might be chillin'
You live in a hell-hole, you wanna get out
But the only thing you're seein' is doubt
On the darkside

As you walk down the street your mind is in a frenzy
You look out at the world like everybody's your enemy
'Cos where you come from a friendly face is a bad sign
That person's even not evil just fuckin' with your mind
So as you walk along you frown your face
Steppin' with the ghetto strut at a rhythmic pace
On a mission to nowhere, yet your walk determined
The devil's got your soul and your heart is burnin'
You couldn't give a damn about another man's life
That's how it is, you're livin' trife
You've seen enough blood spilt to fill up the Hudson
So the ""peace dude"" shit ain't sayin' nothin'
'Cos you couldn't give a damn if your own mama died
But if you had a child, then you would cry
It's like the 3 9's flipped to the 666
All praise is due to the upside down crucifix
The darkside

A day comes when you see the light
Your thoughts become clear and you're feelin' bright
You're happy like a kid again, it must be a dream
Is it a dream? So real it seems
You're on top of the world and you've reached the other side
Floatin' through the sky on the clouds you ride
You thought you'd escaped but it didn't last
'Cos now you're addicted to the sleepin' gas
On the darkside"

Well, like it or not, I prefer it this way.

And you say, I was dreaming
But I've been dreaming for days.
I don't know 'bout the meaning.
So let's keep it this way.

Totally screwed up, I think that's alright.
It's just one more reason for feeling uptight.
But don't try to keep me from flying this kite.
I don't mind you watching, just stay out of sight.
Down in the hall, imbedded in walls,
Hear them screaming.
Stashed in a bar, a brain in a jar,
No one sees them.
Sucking them blind and draining their minds,
Hear them screaming.
Stashed in a car, a brain in a jar,
No one sees them.

Totally freaked out, in every way.
Well, it feels pretty cool and I guess that's okay.
There's no fucking reason to get me out this maze.

The things I did, ah I could just kick myself now
Through nights of lousy dreams
As visions gather in my head
I find it hard to live with the things I did and said
But for you my friend, I'd live it all again
And love you in the end

Chorus:
Anything for you, baby, anything for you
If it took those years to get me here
I'd do it again for you

Took a leap of faith and I stumbled
Tried to live outside grace and I was humbled
But I'd like to bet if I lived to fear regret
Then we never would've met

Chorus

So here we are, and I don't know what we call it
'Cause love is such a funny promise
Commitment is impossible and forever is a lie
But that still leaves you and I

The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from orient land
The king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and his gospel is peace
Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise his holy name."

Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all come down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

But I know I'm just her mommy for a day
She's much too young to realize why mommy can't come home
And that her daddy wanted things this way
We kiss goodbye and my heart breaks to walk away alone
To have to be her mommy for a day

I loved her dad with all my heart they lied and ruined our home
Oh why did he believe the things they said
I pray in time he'll change his mind and take me back once more
Then I'll not be her mommy for a day
She's much too young to realize..."

They can illuminate within it's commandment to illuminate
To attenuate, to illuminate, to accentuate for we are old fellows
Illuminate but we are... 

Like falling two in half from visible to invisible
Into the intercourse that illuminates
Each fragment of the screen, put into the ball
Of which it's part, observe the failing of it's tendencies
There's no above, there's no below
Two months (?), the only dynamic sun"
