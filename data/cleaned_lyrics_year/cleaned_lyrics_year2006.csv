0,The Pineapple Thief,Wilting Violet,TRZDABV12903CBDFE1,2006,"I wish I gave a better answer.
Before the rot set in.
Learned to crawl a little faster.
When it mattered to me.

I wish I fought a little harder.
To make the mess I'm in.
Learned to crawl a little further.
When there was someone within.

I wish I gave a better answer."
1,MISERY INDEX,Sensory Deprivation,TRBFSXY128F428CE46,2006,"[Voyles / Jarvis]

Anachronisms piling high on memories decayed, 300 days have passed again and here I am, nothing's changed,
Burning time, the specters of a past life lived,
Another year, to wallow in the bitterness of loss,
Recast into this languid mold,
Back to a state of Thermidor,
Entranced by the reminiscence haunt,
But what could have been, now is gone,
The detritus of days long past lie shipwrecked 'cross my ocean floor,
Where laughing ghosts echo of halcyon days I knew before,
Demons breeding demons in my head,
Is this how the book of life ends?
Dead drunk, dejected and unsung?
Left with no purpose but to grieve?
And far are the cosmos that twist and unwind,
A left-handed path into the black,
As youth dissolves quickly and tensions divide,
I stand frozen on that day I left,
A circumnavigation course, adrift, lost and compromised,
Navigating mental seas, balkanized, 28, 23, 17, and 33, each era brands its stigma scar,
The stare of Medusa, the death in my eyes,
Numbing reflections, from senses deprived..."
2,Suzi Quatro,Rockin' In The Free World,TRNZPGJ128F425CDE7,2006,"There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan but I am to them
So I try to forget it anyway I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night with a baby in her hand
Under an old street light near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

We got a thousand points of light for the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentle machine-gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, we got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world."
3,Leatherwolf,I Am The Law,TRITHJY128F9304D97,2006,"I rule the land of the unknown
The underground my only home
Know me the cryptic king
I can get you anything
I know I'm vicious off the chain
Evil world is where I reign
My chaos multiplies
No one here gets out alive

You won't turn me down

I keep an Uzi under my front seat
The competition's buried six feet deep
Dirty cops on the take getting paid by me

I am the law!
Run with the cryptic king
I am the law!

Buying lives and selling souls
Like the serpent days of old
Temptation leads the way
Keeping me alive
I know I'm vicious off the chain
Evil world is where I reign
My chaos multiplies
No one here gets out alive

I keep an Uzi under my front seat
The competition's buried six feet deep
Dirty cops on the take getting paid by me

I am the law!
Run with the cryptic king
I am the law!
Run with the cryptic king

I am the law!
Run with the cryptic king

Dirty cops on the take getting paid by me

4,La Oreja de Van Gogh,Cuantos Cuentos Cuento,TRAHKRT128F42AEEB9,2006,"Los años que pasan me pesan me
pisan el alma y la ponen a tus pies.
Si al besarme me diste la vida al
marchar te llevaste mi ser.

Yo pasé tanto tiempo intentando
fingir ser más tonta olvidando
el ayer,
que el amor de mi vida es un pacto:
él me quiere y yo le trato bien.

Pero a veces me descubre
ordenando veinte veces
los libros, las copas, las cartas,
la alcoba
y sospecha con miedo que está
en esta estrofa...
y Dios sabe cuántos cuentos cuento
por disimular.

Y es que si yo te recuerdo me paso
las horas cantando.
Mi vida sucede y los días le ceden
el paso
a la voz castigada sin voto desde
hace ya años
de mi corazón cansado de gritar.

Si bendije el día en que tú llegaste
hoy me gasto la boca
en pedirme perdón
por las veces que intento besarte
mientras beso a quien
es hoy mi amor.

Y es que malditos seáis los
fantasmas, juguéis con ventaja,
doléis de verdad.
Aunque luego os vistáis de
mentira y por eso no os pueda
atrapar.

Pero a veces si no mira nadie
cerrando los ojos lanzo un beso
al aire
y luego suspiro y despacio
imagino que allí donde quiera
que estas amor mío
atteriza en tus labios y piensas
un poco en mí.

Y es que si yo te recuerdo me paso
las horas cantando.
Mi vida sucede y los días le ceden
el paso
a la voz castigada sin voto desde
hace ya años
de mi corazón cansado de gritar.

Y es que a veces no puedo evitar
que se escapen volando
mis mil mariposas que sueñan
contigo a diario.
Mi indulgencia les abre la celda
y te besan llorando
si prometen que en segundos
volverán a la realidad."

6,Patrizio Buanne,Forever Begins Tonight,TRPUNYA128F1485FBA,2006,"Forever Begins Tonight

We made a pact to take the time
To get to know each other deep inside
No rushing in to cross the line
It may be a little old fashioned but it feels so right

Bridge:
Been holding back for so long
What feels so right can't be wrong
Baby you can read it in my eyes
Let's write the story of our lives tonight

Chorus:
Don't be afraid, turn down the light
Baby move in closer
It's gonna be alright
This is the moment we'll remember all our lives
Forever begins tonight

I know you fear those butterflies
But let me tell you a secret, so am I
But it's OK
Baby it's alright
Just follow our hearts now
What we feel inside

Can you feel my body's cold?
Look at me through a telescope
Can you see I'm ugly and I'm old

At the other end
Of a broken line
That scratchy voice is mine

Do what you want
I don't care
Do what you want
I don't care

Touch me with a ten-foot pole
I've got no diseases that I know of
Take a bite out of me then swallow
Wrap me up in plastic and take me home
Oh let me go
You've got an evil mind
And I think I'm losing mine

11,The Thermals,St. Rosa and the Swallows,TRPYOIH128F4289558,2006,"Passing the corners we've kissed in the rain
Passing these old rusted warning signs
What did they say?
I think they said ""Run!""

Passing the roofs of excuses we've made
Passing these open windows
What made me turn away?
How did I fight the black days and the static nights?

St. Rosa, she flies, she flies with the swallows
St. Rosa, I feel I could follow back to Capistrano
And I will hold you tight
Through the cold days and the frozen nights

Passing our enemies
Passing our friends
Passing the means we used to tell the difference between
It's subtle

I try to remember if I was ever lonely
If I was ever low
Hell, hell yes, I was low
How did I fight the black days and the static nights?

St. Rosa, she flies, she flies with the swallows
St. Rosa, I feel I could follow back to Capistrano
And I will hold you tight
Through the cold days and the frozen nights

Passing all the days I switched to Auto-mode
Days for which I've nothing to show
Pausing all the days I'm afraid I'll forget
The day's only clear for a second

The day's only clear for a second
Day's only clear for a second
But I will hold you tight
Through the cold days and the frozen nights

Yeah, but it's cold, cold, cold"

Snowshoes and hunters 
Carried the goods in for you

My young bride
Why aren't you moving at all?
Helps to make the day seem shorter
Helps to make the day seem shorter

My young bride
Why aren't you keeping with you 
All the ones who really love you?

13,Mark Kozelek,Katy Song,TRVNNFV128F932E525,2006,"Some escape, some door to open
This path seems the blackest
But I guess it's the soonest
But there in the clearing
I know you'll be wearing
Your young aching smile
And waving your hand
Can't go with my heart
When I can't feel what's in it
I thought you'd come over
But for some reason you didn't
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Without you is all my life amounts to

A final sleep
No words from my cutting mouth to your ear
Or taut wicked pinches
From my fingers to your bitter face
That I can't heal
I know tomorrow you will be
Somewhere in London, living with someone
You've got some kind of family there to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you

A chance for calm, a hope for freedom
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
By the forest of our spring stay
Where you walked away
And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered, watching the water
Quiet in the corner, numb and falling through
Without you, what does my life amount to?"
14,Shawn McDonald,I Am Nothing,TRDZNXP12903CD19B7,2006,"I am nothing without You
Only a fly upon the wall
Listening in, hoping to find something about You
That will keep me from this fall

And sometimes I catch a glimpse
And my heart begins to beat
Day by day awaken me
You put the wind beneath my feet

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

I am nothing without You
Only the dirt beneath Your nails
My heart is bruised and it's broken
And my soul is very frail

Please give me a reason
I need to name this man
And no longer this broken treason
Only on You I will stand

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

I don't follow water
That brings life to me
'Cause I don't follow truth, oh
That sets man free

Please mend these broken wings
And take the scales from my eyes
Without You I am nothing
I will not survive

Screaming private prayers in a public place 
Expose the causes, extract corruption, proclaim the antidote 
Track down the demons in your mind and cut the bastards' throats 
To eradicate, defend, liberate and to ascend 
This is our mission 
Denying temptation, uplifting fallen brethren 
This is our mission. 

Disprove we're mere monsters of genetics and society 
Freewill is ours to claim, accept the responsibility 
Deny this popular culture of death, refuse to consent defeat 
The truth is on our side, a mission to complete 

Time is short, stay the course. 

To educate, defend, liberate and to ascend

It's a reconstruction of attitude 
This is our mission"

Till you feel the ground
Shake off yesterdays headache

Roll down your windows
Scream out so they know

I'm assistant to your tainted heart
On a mission of misery

You got your new tunes on
You put your game face out
Your ten feet tall, nothing's gonna make you fall
No one can touch you now
No one's gonna figure you out
No one can touch you now

I'm conditioned to soothe your heart
On a mission of misery"
17,The Fratellis,Ole Black 'n' Blue Eyes,TRHTWPT128F14829A1,2006,"Well, she wants to be a singer in the band 
Maybe I'll give the girl a hand
And a microphone
Looks like she's all alone

She can bring a friend
Though she's not my kind of friend
She keeps on staring me out
With her ole black and blue eyes

And I can take her dancing
Just to give the girl a chance and
I was never that good
At being nice when I should

I guess that she'll forgive me
Right before she tries to kill me
'Cause I sold her on yesterday's
""Come take me home"" eyes

And I can take her waltzing
Just so she could kick my head in
Oh, I do believe I was drunk
And both of my heads had shrunk

I guess her name was Tina
'Cause before I'd even seen her
I was lost in her
""What's your name? Just get me fucked"" eyes
""Oh, take me home"" eyes

And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go
And if she does, she's getting there slow
And I can help her out, but I've got somewhere to be
And that's the very thing when your dealing with me

Young soul shagger, begging me to bag her
Filthy heart and swollen hips
And she said, ""Oh, my dearest,
I'm not pretty, isn't it a pity
That you won't kiss these rotten lips?""
""Oh, take me home"" eyes
Ole black and blue eyes

And Chelsea says she's got nowhere to go

I'm looking for love
Love, love, love

When I was only sixteen
Well, give it take a year or more
I've got to singing about
The life I've lead
And I threw it right out of the door

I've got to get some of
That heavy jive
That the old folks are talkin' about
So I strutted my stuff
To the local club
To see what I was leaving now

Looking for love, love, love
Looking, looking for love
Love, love, love

I took my seat at
The foot of the stage
And waited for the fun to begin
And there in the light


Stood this heavy chick
With the cutest babe
That I've ever seen

She smiled at me
She did her dance
Took me by surprise
The way she wiggled her hips
And she shook that ...
Right between the eyes

After the show she came
And sat down
Said: hi son, what's your name? 
I said: never mind that
Think about this:
Loving's the name of my game

She said: that's alright
But it'll cost you, son
I said: tell me what's
The price of the day
She said: twenty dime
And a wedding ring
And everything will be o.k."

Until the sun burns from the sky
Until the sun burns so bright this world is no more
Sun burns from the sky...
And all the people are just dust on the ground

One trillion dollars could buy a heart, a soul
One trillion dollars buying nations ... all the world
One trillion dollars could make the fat ladies sing
One trillion dollars, what a bullshit useless thing

Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight
Woah-oh-oh woah-oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Fuck the world a lot of people gotta die tonight

For you, the sun will be shining

It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

26,Head Automatica,God (Album Version),TRHWARO128F14760D6,2006,"I got a question
Let me ask you, can you
Explain your reasoning to me?

It ain't a matter of my hard luck or bad luck
When there is no luck in it for me

I'm not the type of man to hold a grudge against
Something I can hardly see
But to say that there's a reason for everything
Makes me doubtful and intrigued to say the least

God, you don't want to answer me
But if you do, you better agree
God, you've got the strangest sense of humor
You're too funny to be so heavenly

I've got your number and you owe me
Show me a little common decency
I kneel before you and you bless me, test me
And answer with a plague inside of me

I'm not the type of guy to plead with the sky above
Or with the demon under me
But to say that there's a reason for everything
Makes me doubtful and intrigued to say the least

God, you don't want to answer me
But if you do, you better agree
God, you've got the strangest sense of humor

God, you don't want to answer me
But if you do, you better agree
God, you've got the strangest sense of humor
You're too funny to be so heaven
You're too funny to be so heavenly

God, you don't want to answer me
But if you do, you better agree
God, you've got the strangest sense of humor

God, you don't want to answer me
But if you do, you better agree
God, you've got the strangest sense of humor
You're too funny to be so heaven
You're too funny to be so heavenly"

tu sei la gioia, e smaglio attratto e cereo

Ho contratto intesa con lo spirito
ora e' nudo e, vedi? Non ragiona piu'.
Come una falena ai lumi palpita
io vado dritto al suono dove imperi tu.

Bastano i prodigi che tu sei
Contano i sapori che mi dai
Io ti giro intorno e ingoio fremiti
Io ti giro intorno senza limiti

Voglio la via piu' facile
per avere quiete complice.
Voglio te dentro me per farcela.

...e' come esaudire la gravita' prendere posto nel vortice...

Bastano i prodigi che tu sei
Contano i sapori che mi dai

Io ti giro intorno senza limiti"

Exposes lust
You never covered your sin
You cant kill me

I'll hang your coprse before me
I'll stand and watch you burn
I'll hang your corpse before me
I'll hang your corpes before the world

My hands are covered in blood
A needless murder to say
I laugh as the blood sprays
I'm gone

Chainsaw to the pussy
And you'll bleed inside


Kiss the ground as i stomp your head
Give me a reason to feel wrong
Your pain builds inside your mind
Your hate bellows from your lungs

I should have slayed you
Like that dragon last week
I will not stop

You cannot fucking stop me
I will keep fighting

His eyes black as coals

You break me down
You wear me out
Asleep with all the lights on
You're seeing me doubt
Oh, what was once a lion is just a bird to me now
Oh, help

Is this how it is?
You separate the red from the brown
You forget what it is you were going to say
It doesn't mean much now
It doesn't mean much now
You break me down

Wishing all the bricks untied themselves
Rode in on the broken back of my health
Oh

Is this how it is now?
You separate the quiet and the proud
I think I'll stay in, but it's so nice outside
There's a war I'm losing
Of pins to lightning strikes
I'm found out
You wear me out
Asleep with all the lights on

Of seeing through the crazy things I say
Like I'm better off without you

I still burn like the sun
Raging fire in my blood
I'm tired of living in a lie
I still crash at the thought
That I used to be the beat of your heart
Baby it hurts, cuz I still burn
I still burn

I remember when the lights went out
And the world forgot to turn around
And everything was closing in on me, on me
I swore that I would make it through
I wouldn't hit the ground because of you
That was a promise I couldn't keep
Can't you see baby

I still burn like the sun
Raging fire in my blood
I'm tired of living in a lie
I still crash at the thought
That I used to be the beat of your heart
Baby it hurts, cuz I still burn
I still burn

I still burn at the mention of your name
At the picture of your face
It's a heat I can't escape

Pesen hampaat
Enkä meikkaa

Varhain torilla vilkasta jo
Vanhat odottaa, aukeaako
Lähipankin ovi ollenkaan

Viimeisenä työpaikalla oon

Oma vika kun tällaiseen jään
Mut en tiedä enää itsekään
Ketä pelkään
En ole nainen, en yhtään mitään

we've been here before
that place where we dwell until
we find we both want something more

so let's pretend that for a moment 
we have never loved before
touch my skin
and i will kiss your lips and
we can both ignore

What you're made of, what you've got
Four is sore, just a ripped and bloodied claw
Five is a bunching fist that's within me
Six little stitches thread through my heart
Seven shiny reasons are tearing us apart
Eight lose your hate, it's a game so come on
Love me it's your fate
Nine cold crimes in the night please forgive me
Ten are the tears that are frozen on your face

that drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
an endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
and you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
who cannot seem to give
and the soul afraid of dying
that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been too long
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
lies the seed
that with the sun's love
in the spring
becomes the rose"

We all reside

Don't take as truth
The lies they told
There's nothing that breathes
Is made of gold

Reflection
Gives me clarity
I hope you will
Get what you need

Frustrated faces look away

Forever gone a new path is laid

Die Dunkelheit, sie bricht herein
Und leise höre ich dein Schrei'n

Seit jenem kalten Wintertag
Erinnerungen liegen wach
Sehnsuchtsvoll blickst du zurück
Verloren bist du. Kommst nie zurück

Ich fühle deinen Schmerz in mir
Was auch geschieht, ich bin bei dir
Vereint sind wir in dieser Nacht
Ich spüre sie hier, deine Macht

so restless and free 



I wanted more than you could give.

And running for our lives
Start running, they're coming

With no resources left to save
Sickened from our water still we can't accept the blame
Too weak to hold our heads in shame
Ashamed, we can't be saved

It's insane, too late
We seal our fate
Drowning in the chaos and the flames that we create
Glorify defeat
And the story's incomplete
Put your head between your knees
And watch your history repeat

Call off the forces
Prepare the horses
A good days work now carry out the corpses
So clear another path
And recreate the past
Burn 'em to the ground another bomb another blast
They throw a stone we launch a boulder from our home
But live in houses made of glass
We live without a fear
We think we're free and clear
And now the time is here to face the facts
Under attack, so don't look back

Scrappin' for a bag of gold rings and codeine
Whole life savings hid under the molding
Mama said, ""Knock them out"" and I'm quoting

You're voting which you're hoping
Will stop the guns from smoking
Is someone fucking joking?
They're bonkers in sheep's clothing

I know places where the kids keep crooking
Lacking the essential vitamins and protein
Hustlin' and hyphy are eloping
I'm the best man bustin' shots and toasting

Sippin' Grey Goose get clipped off the bird
Come Sunday mornin' get tripped off the word
TV and them preachers got pimp talkin' verbs
Settin' us up to get ripped off and stirred

You flipped all them birds so your funds act right
Here come the drought whole thang's half price
My high school career counselor's advice
""Lil' niggaz act nice for your beans and rice""

I got some fight, baby, take it to the head
I gives a fuck if it's permed or in dreads
Never snitch to the locals or the feds
See they tryna break us off so they don't have to break bread

'Cause Uncle Same ain't the baker, he's the butcher
We all on punk'd with no Ashton Kutcher
Where ballin' no broke, cutthroats kaput ya
Ain't never took dope but them dopes done took ya

Stop flyin' ol' glory man, cut it down
If your job ain't payin' right, shut it down
If your cat got 18's, let it pound

Tongue kiss death, have mass murder orgies till there's no one left
They're finger-fuckin' Lady Liberty under her dress
And since I didn't say this under my breath

I might be under arrest, now lemme introduce
My slave name's Ray Riley, you can call me Boots
'Cause we gon' boot 'em outta power then spread the loot
We need to drive that freedom train, not ride caboose

And you can tell by the way I walk my walk
That there's a coroner behind me holdin' chalk
'Cause he works for the county wh' off your plate

We ain't one dimensional, max-detentional
Lookin' for the liquor store, what them hubbas hittin' fo'?
We raised by the street light, praised for the street fight
Days we ain't eat right, hazed to complete life

Had to make homes outta muck and dirt
Just to get dinner take luck and work
They don't need my rights, they induct a curse

En somme j'ai vaincu l'épée vaincue par le baiser 
L'homme taille comme un bison troque sa lame pour les larmes usées 
Le visage pâle lésé de magie noire, visée 
La rabat-joise vision de celui qui vit mal ta joie 
L'amour et la mort sont deux extrêmes qui s'kiffent à mort 
Le noir et le blanc sont complémentaires, kif-kif 
Bleu, blanc, rouge, vert, jaune, rouge, black, blanc , beur 
Noir, blanc jaune nuit et jour confrontez vos cultures

Ma mess with me, I'm better than lotto
Got more than a million, fuck a dollar and a dream
You don't even need a dollar, holla at the team
Chicken, cornbread, collared on your greens
Mansions, cars, Prada on your jeans
Hell in Harlem, I'm poppin' up in Queens
Brooklyn, the Bronx, hoppin' on the scene
And you're not from the regime, and I'm popular with fiends
No gossip they cop it, crotched up in a lean
Cars I cop it, crotched up and I lean
Seventy five, dropped it on a Beam
And you love the way I'm bouncin' it, weed I roll a pound of it
Ya'll niggaz are counterfeit, money I stay countin' it
Throw a punch and I counter quick, down to flip
Beef I love the sound of it, your crib'll be surround in it

But my wrist so bright, look like 'Sunny Delight'
Twenty K times twenty, times twenty the price
You don't do math, eight million in ice

Battery triple A, where the icicles lay
And beat you with a wiffle bat, all over a nickel play

Right in the bra, it tickle her little nipples hey!(Hey!)

So you keep on driving faster into the sun
But everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Don't have to find your own way out
You've got a voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are
And if you just can bear to be alone
Then I'll stay

What you've been going through

And the song for every soul who stands alone

The ache of life is more than you are able

Hold on love, don't give up
Don't close your eyes
The light is breaking through the night

Step out into the day, all the clouds and all the rain are gone
It's over now
Step out into the sun, for you have only begun to know
What it's all about
As the hungering dark gives way to the dawn, my love
It's over now

Time will let the story told grow and grow 'til it unfolds
In a way that even you cannot ignore
You can say the seasons change but never if you just remain
In a place where the freeze is at your door

What you don't know is the signs are right for the turning tide

Hold on, hold on
It won't be long
So hold on"

It's just a promise of another empty day
It's just a life sentence for our decay

You can join the living dead and work all f**king day
Break your back and see your hope slip away
Manufactured and brainwashed they'll fill you with pride
Till your dead and f**king empty and hollow inside

You call this f**king freedom but who the f**k is really free
When we are living in a state that refuses to deal with you and me
They call this f**king freedom?
Well I say it's a load of shit
But our future will hold nothing if we f**king give

And they last too fucking long

That's why we carved it in stone

And where it was written
Is where it will fucking stay
It's the sword that we live by
Even if it means we have to die this way

We've had enough

Die ihre Kronen zu einem von grün sprühenden Tor verbinden.
Der Boden vom großen Wald ist weich, das Moos ein Teppich.
Es wachsen ganz hohe Pilze, ihre Hüte bunt und fleckig.
Goldene Strahlen strecken die Finger durch Zweige,
Vögel zwitschern in den Bäumen, ein Reh springt aufgeschreckt zur Seite.
Das Moos dämpft die Schritte.
Es duftet nach Tannen und Frische.
Unter einem Stamm kommt eine Schlange geschlichen.
Der Wald ist ein lichtes grün, dann ein dichtes grün,
Es verdichtet sich immer mehr, als würd es das Licht anziehen.
Schmetterlinge spielen mit Strahlen, die durch das Laub sickern,
Verschwinden immer mehr, jetzt wird das Land dichter.
Wo die dunklen Blätter seine letzten Reste aufwischen,
Hört man in der ferne, wie Odem dichten Rauch zischen.
Ein Gestank schlängelt sich durchs Dickicht wie Vipern.
Ein Geräusch wie von scharrenden Glieder.
Die Stämme stehen so dicht,
Sie verdecken dem Prinzen die Sicht.
Die Sonne fühlt sich hinter den Bäumen verängstigt, selbst hinters Licht.
Der Gestank kommt näher und näher,
Das Licht schickt nur vereinzelte Späher.
Dann überspült ihn beißender Rauch wie ein Meer."""

To rise against the leaders of a phony dead scene in a magazine.

Gone, so many friends and lovers.
So far, nothing to show in turn.

They'll take it all back, all those empty words.
I'll show the dregs where all their slander has led,
if it takes my whole life, for all the tears that I have shed 
They'll take it back, I'm making a pact.
They'll take it back, I'm making a promise.

It must be done.

The storm yet to come binds us as one.
Through it all, loneliness and adversity,

On the side of a little hill
Picks the litter from the ground

And she drives us wild

Oh and she moves like a little girl
I become a child, man
She moves my world
And she gets splashed in rain
And turns away
And leaves me standing

Got a wolf to keep her warm

71,Rise Against,Injection,TRRLGDR128F933A7C9,2006,"Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake?
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
There's a burden you've been bearing in spite of all your prayers
As a light turns off inside your heart 
Can you remember what it's like to care?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
But the memories that haunt us are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grey. 

Yet I fall, through these clouds, reaching, screaming

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

This grip loosens but it never breaks (never breaks)
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall (break my fall!)
In them I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass until forever - until forever ends?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa"

Don't tell me that from now it won't be the same
It doesn't matter 'cause at the end of the day
It isn't what you say it's what you do

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever

Don't tell me you'll make things better for us
Don't tell me that you're some one I can trust
It doesn't mean a thing to me just because
It isn't what you say it's what you do 
Your actions will speak louder than you

What you say will be forgotten someday
What you do will be remembered
Empty promises always fade away
What you keep will last forever
What you keep will last forever

So show me that you really figured it out
And show me everything that you are about
But if you can't then you should just shut your mouth

'Cause I don't care what you say or what you do
You can't take back what you've put me through
Your actions will speak louder than you

What you say will be forgotten someday

 I lost this round
 I thought I could win more
 Than I actually found
 Was it worth a try?
 No I wouldn't say
 The price was too high
 For someone like me to pay
 
But what's the use
 Of regretting what's done?
 Wouldn't I do it again
 If another chance would come?
 I've become so bitter
 Over what's supposed to be sweet
 And still I'm eager
 To be offered another treat
 
I've thought if through and I've come to a conclusion
 That I tend to put aside to end up with confusion
 I'm trying to save myself from superfluous pain
 With the trade off of losing any possible gain
 I'm watching every step building up a thick shield
 Searching my way out of a condemned mind field
 
The game is over
 And I've lost my bet
 Now all I can play with
 Is a dull empty threat
 But what is it worth
 If it's against your will
 How would I know
 If you really care for me still?"

Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

A handshake of carbon monoxide

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises

Right before my eyes
I looked to God way above me
He looked down at my lies

I said ""oh Lord please help me
I am on my knees""
""Your path is yours"" he told me
""Yours to reap""

A mighty wind did pull me
Tore at my face
My flesh is raped at his hand
I am the world's disgrace

The Heaven opened above
me
And down Gods tears came
Lashing away at my skin
My stinking, rotten frame

I though I'd fought the
demons that roamed above me
I thought I'd slew their blood
red hands
Their hearts still beat with all
the hatred for me
Their mark still burns into my
very soul
And I walk with them.
They're shadowing my soul."

Terror can be read in my face
I keep forgetting that there is nothing to fear

Caged inside
I cannot seem to end the battles
Breaking down, I worship the insane

I've always known it is too late
The signs burn deep in my soul
End of the waiting comes
I'm taking my life

I loathe all the things I see
What you feel doesn't matter to me
All these words and still there is nothing to hear

Caged inside

Breaking down, I worship the insane

Churning 
Burning
With frustration
Churning 
I am Turning 
Drowned in sickness
Twisting 
Disease
Swirling 
Fever
And frustration
Vile infection
Churning

Burning 
Conflicts
Enter death

Born to pain but never again, no"

Wach auf, du musst entscheiden!
Wach auf, was du machst, ist Zeitverschwenung!

Ich finde es nicht gut, dass du dich nicht wehrst,
dass du deiner Zukunft keinen Zutritt gewährst.
Ein Schritt zurück ist für dich nicht mehr drin,

But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old
Ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some like the perfume from Spain
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

( some like the bop-type refrain )
( I'm sure that if, I heard even one riff )
( it would bore me terrifically too )
( but I get a kick out of you )

( some they may go for cocaine )
( I'm sure that if, I took even one sniff )
( it would bore me terrifically too )

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see, you obviously do
Not adore me

Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you"

Floating over a sea of vodka
Separated from the rest
Fights problems with bigger problems
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Water pouring from her eyes
Alcoholic and very bitter
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start
We knocked another couple back
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Still prepared for an attack
They didn't know they'd been disabled
Felt a wave, a rush of blood
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
And you're out swimming in the flood
You kept back you kept unspoken
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start
You got a look in your eye
When you're saying goodbye
Like you wanna say hi

The light was on but it was dim
Revolver's been turned over
And now it's ready once again
The radio was playing ""crimson and clover""
London bridge is safe and sound
No matter what you keep repeating
Nothing's gonna drag me down
To a death that's not worth cheating
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart

For someone half as smart you'd be a work of art

And a souped up car on a county road

So we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
Learn to hold my own

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
There was more to life than that
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die

Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'til I got home
Daddy he'd say listen son
But back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know

I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from under me
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said son you came here to live
You didn't come here to die

Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
Met a girl in town put some money down
On a little house with a yard

Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was settin' there at his side

Don't you know it can never be too late
For us to succeed?
Out of every misery
You can be released
As long as you believe

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be relieved
For us to be relieved

Your lifestyle could be so different
From how it is right now
You know that you could change so many things
If only you want that

You should know it can never be too late
Just get up and try
And if you fall and wonder why
Just try an other time
But don't give up to fight

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be relieved
For us to be relieved

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be relieved
For us to be relieved

You're always looking for a scapegoat
Like everything is them fault
And never ever you gon' say
Maybe I did mistakes
You're acting-up like a wiseguy
Never you gon' say why
Like you know everything
And what thay say just can't be right
How come you never change?
How come you always failed
In everything you did before
Back then until today?

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be relieved
For us to be relieved

Help is coming
As long as you believe
Help is coming
For us to be relieved
For us to be relieved"
93,Phoenix Mourning,My Future Actress,TRLDRUG128F934B650,2006,"I am washing my hands of you.
Hand prints on my heart still bleeding through.
A momentary chance for reasoning . . .
And in the morning she'll be leaving.
This is one fight i can not win.

She is delicate when she smiles at you and you hate it.
Let it go unnoticed, a perfect reflection.
He wants what she wants . . .
I had seen it in a movie once.
A hollywood romance and i let it go unnoticed.

Its been a long night and im not looking forward to this drive.
Its been a long night and im not looking forward to saying goodbye.

She took the stage on opening night.
It was so beautiful how she moved through the room.
Maybe it was the light . . .
Or maybe i was consumed.
As i made my way through.
To the front to see . . .
My future actress in action, acting for me.

These are the confessions of a photograph.
The ones i said that i had burned.
And the ones that you said you took back.
Unnoticed, a perfect reflection.
I am many miles away from everything.
In hopes of never returning.
When you see what i see.
You will notice . . . a perfect reflection.

Its been a long night and im not looking forward to this drive.
Its been a long night and im not looking forward to saying goodbye.

A romance ending gracefully as goodbyes settle the night.
Pictures we paint stained canvases we hate.
One last goodbye and i promise ill never be the same.
Pictures we paint stained canvases we hate.
One last goodbye but i wish you would stay.

Its been a long night and im not looking forward to this drive.
Its been a long night and im not looking forward to saying goodbye"

No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free:

Turn you eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conqu'rors we are!

Turn you eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.

His word shall not fail you He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well.
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

Turn you eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace."

To share your plate

I remember it well
It is in me still
I have seen that I can die
I'm reminded and I wave my own flag

I saw the one go out the window

And come back down
And come back down again

One's lending me hope
Who share their plates
Fighting for truth, joy, justice, or
Just try again
Or lend a kind eye
I could just give up
Maybe sleep all day

This time as visual as possible,
Guns blast at the hospital,
The walls are white washed with tin rooftops,
To show love you lick two shots,
It's dangerous man,
Journalists hire gunmen there's violent women,
Kids trust no one cause fire burnt them,
Refugees die in boats, headed for peace,
Is anyone scared of death here' Not in the least,
I walk by the old lady selling coconuts under the tree,
Life is cheap here but wisdom is free,
The beach boys hang on the side, leaning with pride,
Scam artists and gangsters fiendin to fight,
I walk with three kids that can't wait to meet God
Lately, that's Bucktooth, Mohamed and Crybaby,
What they do everyday just to eat lord have mercy,
Strapped with an AK and they blood thirsty…

So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? Hmm.
So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? Hmm.

We begin our day by the way of the gun,
Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front,
We got no police ambulance or fire fighters,
We start riots by burning car tires,
They looting, and everybody start shooting,
Bullshit politicians talking bout solutions, but it's all talk,
You can't go half a block with a road block,
You don't pay at the road block you get your throat shot,
And each road block is set up by these gangsters,
And different gangsters go by different standards,
For example, the evening is a no go,
Unless you wanna wear a bullet like a logo,
In the day you should never take the alleyway,
The only thing that validates you is the AK,
They chew on Jad it's sorta like coco leafs,
And there ain't no police…

So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? Hmm.
So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? Hmm.

I'm a spit these verses cause I feel annoyed,
And I'm not gonna quit till I fill the void,
If I rhyme about home and got descriptive,
I'd make Fifty Cent look like Limp Biskit,
It's true, and don't make me rhyme about you,
I'm from where the kids is addicted to glue,
Get ready, he got a good grip on the machete,
Make rappers say they do it for love like R-Kelly,
It's HARD, harder than Harlem and Compton intertwined,
Harder than harboring Bin Laden and rewind,
""to that earlier part when I was kinda like""
We begin our day by the way of the gun,
Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front,
We got no police ambulances or fire fighters,

Show me 'round the rooms in your house,
Down the hallway to your doubt

And I won't blame you
I won't blame you
I won't blame you

Our bloodline's blended
Lives change with the melting snow
There's no easier decisions
Just life we've been given
Resigned to failing control

Show me 'round the rooms in your house,
Down the hallway to your doubt

And I won't blame you
I won't blame you
I won't blame you

Lay them at my table
Secrets meant for me
Life we know's not simple
This loving not for free

Show me 'round the rooms in your house,
Down the hallway to your doubt

And I won't blame you
I won't blame you
I won't blame you

Tell me does it hurt
And are there night-mares
Up above the grande facade
Your words are fallen apart
Won't you tell me who'd you'd be

Yes I know what it is to be free
To run as far as the eye can see
But long knife come--buffalo gone
Like blades of grass they cut us all down

Why in the world are you so cruel?
Here is a girl who's working in a factory
Spends all her time there thinking what she want to be
She got no boyfriend--she got no window
She just a lonely heart--it's tearing me apart

There's a boy now doesn't have a word to say
Cat got your tongue now--night to night and day to day
He got no girlfriend--he got no money
He just a lonely heart--it's tearing me apart

Why in the world are you so cruel?
Everywhere I go there's a world full of heartbreak
Hole in the sky now--tell me where for God's sake
Where is that sunshine? Where is that rainbow?
Who got an answer here? Tell me what I want to know

Nobody knows the trouble I see
Nobody cares--nobody but me
And James Bond, Jackie O, Johnnie Ray and Garbo
Who got an answer here? Tell me what I want to know"
112,Plain White T's,Hey There Delilah (Abbey Road Version),TRVXAXH128F424EEFC,2006,"Hey there Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl
Tonight you look so pretty

Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true

Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen

Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me girl, someday
I'll pay the bills with this guitar

We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good

Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away

I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way

Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history

Like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me"
113,Mr. Lif,Collapse,TRJXQUM128F42A4BF5,2006,"I notice that you mentioned your opinion
Oh, now they got a couple of things to say too
What should I do?
Listen or leak crimson?
All over the floor from my wrists
There, now you've got Lif
Some natural, authentic, completely genetic
Inherited fate trait
He was eclectic but he didn't make great
Status is a trendy little song on a dub plate
Give it some spins and it begins to wither
My nigga
What's up, my nigga?
Let's show and prove
Make moves this winter
Rent a whip and start riding
Look into my eyes and see those two worlds colliding
I wanna be home making records
Now I'm in the studio and all I wanna do is be home
(What's stopping you?) Who's that?!
Move back!
Drive me to the hospital, I'm at the point of collapse

Sorry, baby girl, your man is out on tour
The floor may drop out if I don't walk out
Handle my B.I.
See, I think I might have just missed my own life 'cause I'm working tonight
And the pressure {*4X*}
Sales, interviews, touring, performing at my peak
Man, I need sleep {*2X*}

Now what truly defines one's life?
Is it the legacy they left behind?
Well, this music seems to be mine
It's been nine interesting years in the game
Not too much has changed
I've still got a saw to hack up your frame
Performed at all your favorite festivals
Some cats do one show and blow
My destiny to live on the low
It's got me locked in the basement
In the winter in December
Open window, cold toe
Face down on the futon rocking yesterday's attire
Woke up early feeling uninspired
Staring at my album outline
At this point I've drafted up about nine
New Lif, yeah, it's about time
Maybe you've seen me on stage with Ace, Came to Perceptionists
Or read an article on how my verbal weapon is
Well, regardless how you got here, feel fear
Kick the kick, stomp the snare, goodbye the hi
Watch the rhythm die then resurrect
As I recollect
Ancient black intellect
Erase and redirct
Your collective minds to check a selective rhyme
Detail
Available at retail, griotmatics
Ipod and Treo addicts gotta have it
It's black magic that'll wrinkle time's fabric
Have you heard of Lif?
Well, maybe, sorta, perhaps
Listen up and let me guide you to the point of collapse"
114,Vetiver,Won't Be Me,TRAYEGG128F42B8FF7,2006,"Tell me know, spell it out
Are you waiting for that one?
Love to lift your life about
Well it won't be, tell you now it won't be me
Hard times have been mine
I tried to keep them far from you
Did the best that I could do
But it won't be, don't you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, don't you know it won't be me

I've done (?) to ever cheat your mystery girl
Gave all that I knew to give
Still it won't be,
Oh you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, oh you know it won't be me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, tell you now it won't be me

I won't lie, I won't deny that I led you farther on
Thought I heard them bells a'chime,
But they won't be, oh you know they won't for me

Won't be, won't be me
Won't be, oh you know it won't be me"
115,Mercy Fall,Wake (Album Version),TRLFFGH128F148CD9B,2006,"Disengage her as he whispers forever
Disenchanted in the early morning light
There he puts her, in the shadow of his eyes
And she knows she might not make it out this time

Thought she heard the angels singing
Turns out it was falling leaves
And winter never gave her anything

And there she goes, exposed
In the wake of selfish eyes
And in the clear, she'll disappear
There everything will be all right

Disregarded in a cradle of comfort
Disillusioned by the hope that never comes

Thought she had herself a rainbow
Turns out they just disappear
And leave you in a sky that's all too clear

And there she goes, exposed
In the wake of selfish eyes
And in the clear, she'll disappear
There everything will be all right
All right
All right

Thought she heard the angels singing
Turns out they just disappear
And leave you in a sky that's all too clear
Yeah

And there she goes, exposed
In the wake of selfish eyes
And in the clear, she'll disappear
There everything will be all right

All right

Our time is standing still
Beside me now

How this turned out right
Ohhhhhhhhh..........

I know something that you'll never know

I know something that you'll never know

(Do your thang, honey!)

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside

Don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

(Do your thang, honey!)

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (What you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, oh yeah!

Ain't no other man, it's true, alright
Ain't no other man but you

Never thought I'd be alright, no, no, no
'Till you came into my life, yeah, yeah, yeah
World was cloudy, now it's clear, yeah
Your the life that I needed

You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on givin' it up! 

So tell your mother, your brother, your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no-one else's
Ohoho

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, ohoho

You are there when I'm a mess
Talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (Next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Oooh)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, oh yeah

Ain't no other man, it's true, alright

118,Adam Arcuragi,1981 (or Waving at You as We Part at Light Speed Will Look Like I'm Standing Still),TRMNFEW128F428BC0A,2006,"All of the hidden instruments from before I was born keep sending
Miles of discreet transmission to shake me back and forth
And oh the part in my hair like rambo before he ran off
And traded his love for a life of being cold

Oh one day, the few pictures taken will spoil
And for all those that come later my face and the past will all be brown

But between you and me
I'll be singing through my teeth
And smiling as I go

And the words may all be wrong
But I'll still sing every song
My last breaths will lay low

Whispering how much I love you seems like far off coastal lights
And all the jealous one's I could gather wouldn't stretch these tall sails tight
But oh, this nursery for lost jealous sons
Sings in a low and continuous refrain of joy I'll never know
Than just like the shape and tremble from throats as before
The promise that's past but the anticipation of seven thousand mornings

But between you and me
I'll be singing through my teeth
And smiling as I go

And the words may all be wrong
But I will still sing every song
My last breaths will lay low

On that last day when I dissipate all the angels will rejoice
Pressing their wings together to sing in heaven's perfect voice
And role imagined and real and unknown
The song like the pulse an electron chain from the center of the sun
The rim and the role of the space that the massive once hold
All one day will wear out and collapse and eventually explode

But between you and me
I'll be singing through my teeth
And smiling as I go

And the words may all be wrong
But I will still sing every song
My last breath will lay low"
119,Amos Lee,Sympathize,TRJNYKL128F1488552,2006,"It ain't no jive
I was burnin' alive
Whenever you walked in the room
It happened so quickly
I was feelin' so sickly
Like a lover who lost his muse

The sharks in the tank
The man in the bank
He wants my money to loan
I can't understand
What the hell is his plan
I ain't even got a home
Ain't got a home

The girl on the street
With holes in her feet
Looks through eyes of a clown
She don't look at me
Just feelin' kinda sad
So I just walk around
I reassess
She's down on her luck
She's reading a book of lies
I don't know when I'll be comin' home, baby
But I sure can sympathize

Angels spread their wings
On all the dirty things
You do

She drops to the floor
Her head's by the door
Her bible is by her side
Heaven is callin'
The new world is fallin'
And she ain't got a single person left
To confide
No one to confide
I sympathize
Can sympathize"
120,Nikola Sarcevic,From Where I'm Standing,TRRMWAQ128F428BBBD,2006,"How lucky are you on a scale? With the city smog to inhale?
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing

Do you like the taste of your own tale?
How bitter are you when I fail?
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing

No need to pass out stricture when the actor is unknown
No need to paint this picture if only half is shown
Two bucks for every lie you hand in, Two bucks really tells a tale
You sure look pale from where I'm standing Next to you

It's easy to outrun a snail 
To choose a bank note rather than jail
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing

In the mirror spotting something stale
Can something hard as a rock be that frail?
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing

Everything is not for sale 
Every lie is not easy to nail
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing

A lot of shit leaving in your trail
Take a tip and go and set your sail
You are looking kind of pale from where I'm standing"
121,Perpetual Groove,Legends Of Preston,TRRHWMT128F93546F4,2006,"Coming back tomorrow, now down on a single knee,
Shotgun loaded questions fell back on a tongue ""type of"" tree
Man enough to take it, stronger enough to make believe

Dip down below the skyline, watch the world passing by,
Backdrop of the nightfalls, tossing stars throughout the sky

Time keeps on wasting
Waiting on you
Drawn into places
Carved into two
Let your temptations
Run through your hands
Cold waking hours
Lost them again"
