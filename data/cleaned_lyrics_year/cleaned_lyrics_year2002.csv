1,Lords Of Acid,Stoned On Love Again,TRRKRET128F14A2409,2002,"my life's more crazy than before
cuz i found me a girl who gives me more
everywhere we go we need to score
im stoned on love again

the girl's a kinky sex machine
she's the wildest chick that you've ever seen
she's fuckin' horny, oh so mean
im stoned on love again

stoned on love again(x4)

im flying higher than before
cuz i found me a girl who gives me more
a thousand new things to explore
im stoned on love again

cuz my girl is the hottest thing
she got me danglin' honestly?
i'd raise her 'til i burn my wings
im stoned on love again

and when i drove her ?home
completely drunk and oh so stoned
i tried to hold up through her smell
the perfume that is hot as hell

and when im driving home at night
always satisfied but oh so tired
the only thing that's on my mind
is that i wanna four wheel drive
im stoned on love again

im dancing wilder than before
cuz i found me a girl who gives me more
vibrations on the disco floor
im stoned on love again

she meets me in my wettest dream
and every night she makes me scream
she does ? sweating ? off steam
im stoned on love again

stoned on love again(x4)

and when i drove her ?home
completely drunk and oh so stoned
i tried to hold up through her smell
the perfume that is hot as hell

and when im driving home at night
always satisfied but oh so tired
the only thing that's on my mind
is that i wanna four wheel drive
im stoned on love again

stoned on love again(x7)

and when i drove her ?home
completely drunk and oh so stoned
i tried to hold up through her smell
the perfume that is hot as hell

and when im driving home at night
always satisfied but oh so tired
the only thing that's on my mind
is that i wanna four wheel drive
im stoned on love again.."
2,Radiorama,Yeti,TRJXUVT128F9336E62,2002,"I love your world 
Where the winners might be sweet all around 
Tell me your life. 
Tell me what you'll be afraid of this night 

If you wanna take a look around 
Please don't hit a man who understands 
As the story goes you are the one 
Run away in other place 
In the night you're looking for to meet 
And checking the man to get in fit 


Just the story goes you are the one 
Run away in other place 

Yeti, yeti, yeti, yeti
Yeti, looking a horrid man. 
Yeti, living in other land

I want your soul and I really like to seem to your heart 
I feel with you and I know that you are living apart 
If you wanna take a look around..."
3,Soilwork,Mercury Shadow,TRSCNNO128F427FD0E,2002,"Breakdown of a shadow unknown
Tomorrow belongs to no one
As I repent the things I've done
There is a freeway heading for sorrow
Breakdown cause you've had enough
You've never felt so strong
Steal away, steal away let it all astray
It's been so long!
When there comes a time
With a feast on what used to be mine
Sent from the front to the back
All in numbers and fellish black

Breakdown of a shadow unknown
Tomorrow belongs to no one
As I repent the things I've done
There is a freeway heading for sorrow
Breakdown cause you've had enough
You've never felt so strong
Steal away, steal away let it all astray
It's been so long!
When there comes a time
With a feast on what used to be mine
Sent from the front to the back
All in numbers and fellish black

We know how to spit or swallow
Bring out, the Mercury Shadow

Is this the statement that I feel?
Accused to be an unbeliever

Hit the lights and won't you please resign
Way down and right on time

Is this the statement that I feel?
Accused to be an unbeliever

Won't you shut all the doors in mind
The ones you cannot find
There is no way that I can see
Why you keep on... haunting me!

We know how to spit or swallow
Bring out, the Mercury Shadow"
4,Christina Aguilera,Cruz,TRBEAMO128F425B75F,2002,"I'm leaving today
Living it
Leaving it
To change

Slowly drifting
Into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied and twisted
Are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags
Finally on the move

I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change

As I'm driving
I'm captured by the view
So much beauty
The road becomes my muse
The heat is rising
And my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected
Is the child that lies within

See I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change, oh yeah

See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it
Oh I'm leaving it
To change

But somehow I miss it
I think I'll really miss it
One day, ohh

I turn on the radio
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of
Yesteryears and broken dreams I'm free
Finally free, ooh

Slowly drifting
Into a peaceful breeze, oh
Ohh

Ooh yeah
I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it, oh yeah
Leaving it to change
To change, oh no

See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm
Living it, living it
Leaving it, leaving
To change
Ohh oh

I'm leaving today
Oh I'm living it
I'm leaving it to change
Living it, to change
Leaving it
To change
Ooh, oh yeah

Living it, leaving it
Said I'm living it
I'm leaving it
Living it, leaving it
To change
I'm leaving it to change

But somehow I miss it
I think I'll really miss it
One day, yeah"
5,No Angels,Anchor Your Love,TRTERIS128F42B3C90,2002,"It was the first time we met 
I never forget 
The way you looked at me 
I felt my heart skip a beat 
I never thought that I would 
Ever find this 
Until the moment that I felt your gentle kiss 
The way you love me baby 
No man has loved me before 
I never felt so good 
And now I'm wanting you so much more 
I wanna stay by your side 
And if you treat me right 
I never be untrue 
And that is why I'm asking you 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above? 
It's only you that I'm thinking of 
And all the love you bring 
Each and every night I'm dreaming 

How can I anchor your love? 
Your love? 
How can I anchor your love? 

The precious love that we share 
I promised to care 
Baby, you look so fine 
And I'm so glad that you're mine 
I never thought that I would 
Fall in love like this 
The love you offer me 
I just could not resist 

The way you love me baby 
No man has loved me before 
I never felt so good 
And now I'm wanting you so much more 
Boy when I'm dreaming of love 
It's you I'm thinking of 
There ain't no other one 
Who makes me wanna sing this song 

Boy I really like you 

How can I anchor your love? 
Tell me how can we reach the stars above?

All the things that you do

Everything I gave you everything 
And all the love you bring 
It's such a precious thing 

Everything I gave you everything 
And all the love you bring 
It's such a precious thing 

How can I anchor your love?

6,Capital Inicial,Algum Dia,TREKETA128F92EFC86,2002,"Ninguém nunca te disse
Como ser tão imperfeito
Você tem tão pouca chance
De alcançar o seu destino
É fácil fazer parte
De um mundo tão pequeno
Onde amigos invisíveis
Nunca ligam outra vez

Talvez até porque
Ninguém ligue pra você

Se você quer
Que eu feche os olhos
Pra alguém que foi viver
Algum dia lá fora
E nesse dia
Se o mundo acabar
Não vou ligar
Pra aquilo que eu não fiz

Faz muito pouco tempo
Aprendi a aceitar
Quem é dono da verdade
Não é dono de ninguém
Só não se esqueça que atrás
Do veneno das palavras
Sobra só o desespero
De ver tudo mudar

Talvez até porque
Ninguém mude por você

Se você quer
Que eu feche os olhos
Pra alguém que foi viver
Algum dia lá fora
E nesse dia
Se o mundo acabar
Não vou ligar
Pra aquilo que eu não fiz

Talvez até porque
Ninguém ligue pra você

Se você quer
Que eu feche os olhos
Pra alguém que foi viver
Algum dia lá fora
E nesse dia
Se o mundo acabar
Não vou ligar
Pra aquilo que eu não fiz

Se você quer
Que eu feche os olhos
Pra alguém que foi viver
Algum dia lá fora
E nesse dia
Se o mundo acabar
Não vou ligar
Pra aquilo que eu não fiz

A vida lá fora"
7,Love Of Lesbian,All These Days,TREECRN128F426666B,2002,"Tell me what you see in me,
No identity, no human fles

Take by day , you sailor moon, 
No hurts than moons

All these days, so dreams so lonely
All these days making plans for our love
Could not belive you is a place so lone...
Could not belive you is a place so lone...

Stay in a lonely place,
No way scape

Seeing in a love"
8,Extremoduro,Puta,TRURAOR128E078A9E1,2002,"Casi que a la fuerza recorro las horas y no me encuentra el día si no encuentro su boca
diciendo ¡venga , venga, que me vuelvo loca!.
Y ando entre su pelo y hay un agujero;
me subo a las estrellas
y me tiro de cabeza.

Subí al árbol más alto
que tiene la alameda
y vi miles de ojos
dentro de mis tinieblas.
Nosotras no las vemos,
Las hormigas comentan.
Y el caracol: mi vista
sólo alcanza la hierba

Que nada me interesa de alrededor
y me subo a lo más alto de la locura,
me encuentro a mi princesa hablando con la luna
echándose carreras a ver quién es más puta.

Que no me da la gana pasar media vida
buscando esa frase que tal vez no exista.
¡No me mira! ¿Y qué cojones puedo decir?
Mi perro ya no quiere la comida
y en mi cabeza paso el día buscándote.

Llego a tus rincones llenos de flores
y por mis esquinas llenas de colores
se ha desbocao la primavera
la noche entera.

Bebo de una fuente caliente caliente
y vuelvo a ver al hada que nunca me abandona.
Cuando no estoy contigo domestico las horas
y hago que den brincos y hago que corran.

Que no me da la gana pasar media vida
buscando esa droga que tal vez no exista.
¡No me mira el sol que no me mira
si no me viene a ver una sonrisa!
y se me sale dando pedales
sin mi permiso una lagrimilla.

Llego a tus rincones llenos de flores
y por mis esquinas llenas de colores
se ha desbocao la primavera
la noche entera.

Que nada me interesa de alrededor
y me subo a lo más alto de la locura,
me encuentro a mi princesa hablando con la luna
echándose carreras a ver quien es más puta."
9,Chavela Vargas,Paloma Negra,TRWECNC128F4274696,2002,"Ya me canso de llorar y no amanece
Ya no sé si maldecirte o por ti rezar
Tengo miedo de buscarte y de encontrarte
Donde me aseguran mis amigos que te vas
Hay momentos en que quisiera mejor rajarme
Arrancarme ya los clavos de mi penar
Pero mis ojos se mueren sin mirar tus ojos
Y mi cariño con la aurora te vuelve a esperar

Y agarraste por tu cuenta la parranda
Paloma negra, paloma negra ¿dónde, dónde andarás?
Ya no jueges con mi honra parrandera
Si tus caricias han de ser mías, de nadie más
Y aunque te amo con locura ya no vuelva
Paloma negra eres la reja de un penar
Quiero ser libre vivir mi vida con quien yo quiera
Díos dame fuerza que me estoy muriendo
Por irla a buscar

Y agarraste por tu cuenta las parrandas"
10,Donna Fargo,I'll Try A Little Bit Harder,TRHZZMU128F1459CF7,2002,"I'll try a little bit harder if you will
And if you think we're worth trying to save

We were happy once I know we were where where did we go wrong
We were on the same side one time weren't we
Why would we how could we we could not pretend for so long
But I don't want to prolong this mis'ry if you're leavin' 
And I don't think I'd beg you to stay
But I'll try a little bit harder if you will and if you think we're worth trying to save

We can make it work if we care enough somehow somewhere someway
Cause surely what we had is worth whatever it takes to keep it
So let's don't let it let's protect it and not let something precious get away
But I don't want to prolong...
But I'll try a little bit harder if you will and if you think we're worth trying to save
Oh don't you think we're worth trying to save"

12,Cross Canadian Ragweed,Brooklyn Kid,TRKPHSV128F1460FAE,2002,"Well I gotta friend that lives south of town
Loves to sit and burn one down
Spin some vinyl on his stereo
Every now and then he speaks of war
One tour of duty on a foreign shore
Fightin' for his way home
Fightin' for his way home

Returnin' home to his native land
Left New York for Texas man
Quieter times were in his cards
He met a girl she met a man
Dropped to his knees and he took her hand
A simple life ain't that hard
No, a simple life ain't all that hard

A new generation on the ground
Nothin' in the world could bring him down
Flyin' like he had wings
Several years came and went
Not one of them was poorly spent
A good man's life he was chiselin'
Yeah, a good man's life he was chiselin'

Reflecting on the Viet-Cong
Uncle John's Band and a Dylan song
Smellin' like it's supper time
You know it brought a tear to his eye
The day that Jerry Garcia died
He said he was the genius of his time
Yeah, A Friend of the Devil is a Friend of Mine

Don't try to find it
Make the time
A couple of joints and a bottle of wine
You'll be glad that you did
With the Grateful Dead spinnin' round 
Kick your feet back and be astound
By the life of the Brooklyn kid"
13,New Found Glory,Head On Collision,TRFFJZT128F427AAF5,2002,"I've been waiting for a good day 
I've been holding back long enough 
I've been hurting to tell you some thing: 
It's not the falling of the temperature
That's making all our bones run cold
It's the breeze you make 
The presence felt when you're around me 

And it feels like im at an all-time low

Slightly bruised and broken
From our head on collision
I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken 
From our head on collision
I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case
And I'm still 

Waiting for a good day 
I think I've held this long enough 
I think it's safe to tell you some things 
It's not just what you say to people 
And it's not the way you look at me 
It's the way you present yourself 
For all your worst critics to see 

And it feels like I'm at an all-time low 

Slightly bruised and broken 
From our head on collision 
I've never seen this side of you 
Another tragic case of feeling 
Bruised and broken 
From our head on collision 
I've never seen this side of you 
Another tragic case 

Then you were gone 
You were gone... 
All this time you just didn't know it yet 
You were gone... 
All this time you just didn't know it yet 
You were gone... 

And it feels like I'm at an all-time low 

Slightly bruised and broken 
From our head on collision 
I've never seen this side of you 
Another tragic case of feeling 
Bruised and broken 
From our head on collision 
I've never seen this side of you 
Another tragic case 

Another tragic case of feeling 
Bruised and broken 
Another tragic case and I've been 
Still waiting for a good day"
14,Nocturnal Rites,Birth Of Chaos,TRLMAZE12903CF1A5B,2002,"Another genocide, a masterplan foresaw the fall
A resurrection reversed
Up there's a brave new world, a soulless sphere that penetrates
It's the seal to our fate

Your gods have failed
Our will be done

The fiery chains that held but cut the fatal thread at last
Condemned eternities pass
Another motor spins, machinery of hate begins
And still crumbles and grinds

Black souls that seem unreal
Cold empty hearts
The formless hollow shells of man

Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos, regain of the world
Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos reborn

The endless pain begins and torture breeds the suffering
Another destiny fades
A second sacrifice, a last revenge of human kind
Enslave the last one alive

Strapped to the offering god
The slaves of the earth
A blank stare is all that remains
Witness their birth"
15,Uncle Tupelo,I Got Drunk,TRSHECM128F4269F8E,2002,"Well I took a fifth, and I poured me a shot
And I thought about all the things that I haven't got
And I drank that down, and I poured me some more
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor

I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down

Another slow day in this damn town
Keep asking yourself ""why am I still hangin' around?""
You spend half your time just staring into a beer
What you need, you know, you can't find here

I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down

Well I took a fifth, and I poured me a shot
And I thought about all the things that I haven't got
And I drank that down, and I poured me some more
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor

I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down

I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down"

Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination

I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat
Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat

Every face I see is cold as ice
Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination



Like a stream that flows into the sea
I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

17,1200 Techniques,Karma,TRYXLLP128F428652A,2002,"(Prolouge)
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They gonna slap you back (yeh)
Sometimes it hurts
And that's bad karma
Watch out for it

(Chorus)
How am I supposed to live in a world full of negatives
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed
Well I guess I'll have to live day to day
And pray to god that'll I'll be ok, ay ay

(Verse 1)
These fat raps think they fit like they The Iron Man
I got the iron tounge and the iron hand
I make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet so switch the picture
If ya, look in the mirror you bound to get a reflection
Like with every action there is a reaction
With your, dodgy actions you causing negative drama
And if you know gods law you best watch for karma
Now I'm a bomb ya
Running your traps like tacks
You think you floating on the cream
You and your rat pack
While I'm take that thought back now lets dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and (you's a matador)
I'm seeing red (You outta swords)
I'm a target like (Dartsboards)
You floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first while ya shakin I cut off like
umbilicals at birth

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I look around the city and its all such a pity
everybody trying to be pretty don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block nobody's playing hopscotch
they're too busy on the internet surfing that rap

(Verse 3)
Just converse kind of rude like (so what you trying to prove mate)
I say, (nothing I'm just trying to build the feeling I live like you)
I got plans to take this city up to senate
As lifes one big race and want all entries to win it
If you're not with it, like quitters then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
Your a disgrace with a desire
You need to reckon through your fire and look higher higher! look around!
I got sounds that help you get down so you can get up
But oh boy, Im sick of raps that get me fed up
Yeh, they make me wanna throw up 'cause they gotta grow up
But well I'll be feeling a beard and I'll be Sailing like NOAH

(Chorus)

(Interlude 1)
Melbourne.....To Sydney......To Brisbane...Darwin.... To
Perth.....Adelaide.... Tassy
And all Across the O-Z-Z-I-E

(Verse 4)
Picture on the quota it's time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, starting at zero
had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall so
I got a key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And when I unlock the door I'm bringing love to my people
Unlike these Fickle Fanatics that wanna cause death
cut holes flake praying we fall to hells depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
As what goes up comes down never the less
We're stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
Boomerang effect as we all face our karma

(Chorus)"
18,Madder Mortem,Deadlands,TRUAQWJ12903CF1C03,2002,"All I ever wanted was a little discipline
A master's touch to give me some serenity within
Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself
All I ever needed was a minute of safe rest
A stronghold to give shelter from the pressure and the test
Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself

Standing cold in victory and longing for some sun
Begging still for mercy when the time for truth has come

Leave here. Turn home

We're all dry and dead and gone and not to breathe again

Leave here. Turn home

Rip the life and laughter out, rebuild it in my name
When the city rises, I will rule and I will blame
Now I know there's no one there to save me but myself
See me, fat and choking on the words that I remade
See my lover bleeding, there is beauty in the strain

Now I know there's no one there to save me from myself"

[Verse 1]
Y'all sendin' motherfuckas to an early grave
murder men then murder slaves
verbal plays vacant so you herbs behave
When I was your age I wasn't that a rave
I was bangin' jackin' spades lacin' page after page
At that stage, you rookies would've bat at the bat cage
With pride up in ya swingin' stance
While I was catchin' finger cramps
Writin' in a dark room wid swingin' lamps
You sing and dance, you won't step you bringin' ramp shit
Ring the bell, I fight you like a horse in a cell
Bumpin' this hell toward the rail like a sorcerer's spell
7L holds cream like a tortoise's shell
ya organs will swell, click and then you turn into a cell
My thought be malice, shine like aurora borealis
Thought me how to spit in callous oratory at ya axis
I speak my mind like telepathy, burn you like an effigy
So you better choose ya weaponry

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo I spit the words of death
curse ya breath, there's no person left
still can mesh burnin' ya flesh so nothing's left
Of the missin' elements and artificial intelligence
The darkside of a bright mind my rhymes designed to
blow ya back in like a rogue assassin or komodo dragon
Cloak and dagger know no havin' verbal package
With the photographic vocals overlap and overcrackin'
Clones attackin', you need to stick to local rappin'
Cause I roll wid chicks lookin' dyke bend it over bitch
Wid the dopest lips you could ever kiss
Holdin' this is close to this, that'll reconverse on this
Which episode a pack of old crazy motorists
I change hands like polyist(?) or a solar eclipse
Knock you off like a merc you got it, when it's kicks
Women feelin' my tongue, Esoteric spillin' blood
Killin' villainous thugs like Daredevil wid a bentley glove

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo I'm David Blaine raisin' Cain meditate and stay the same
Specialize in state of brains jeopardize a lame frame
Main game flooded daily basis, takin' pages to Israeli paces
Verses that I vomit have the traces of the comet Haley chases
Alien races wid scaley faces, sayin' damn you laced us
Fachist, I blow clouds out the sky
Leave rhy-mers surprised when I gouge out their eyes
I'm the shaman pawn man, the skull of Tutankam-en embalmin' fluid
Runnin' through the veins of the Druid
Like a pharoah, who shadows like the grave of a dead pig
Covered in red sweat, crab ass rappers guard quicker than Bobafed
Or his father Jengo, I might catch 'em like a stitchin' witch
Fuck a pigeon bitch I project vocals to catch rep
like Robotech on attack, the god ock is back

Can't defeat me at your game
You buy and sell me
Separate me from my name

And I want you
To once invert the wrong
Cause I can't breathe
And I want you
To once admit I'm right

You come with something
But it's nothing that I need
You violate me
Have to break me to breathe

And I want you
To once invert the wrong
Cause I can't breathe
And I want you
To once admit I'm right

You point your finger
I'll play that game
With you, with you

To once admit I'm right"

I've built a new house – that touch the sky
I'm not a monkey anymore
I've straightened my back and that's a fact
Keep my eye on a new horizon
where sex and violence is my sugar and spice

I'm not a loser anymore
from second to first, just to quench my thirst
I'm not a loser anymore
my hands on the wheel, all dressed in steel
Keep my mind on a higher ground
while the primal instincts are going down

Looking at all God's creatures
I'm not the brightest one
One in an angry crowd
come down to wave the gun

I'm not a fighter anymore
I'm business hype and I need to score
I'm not a fighter anymore
Right at the peak I walked out the door
Now I'm building a new religion
It's ""me and I"" so help yourself

I'm not a hunter anymore
I have dinner at eight, then time for rape
I'm not a hunter anymore
I wrote the law, but my feet got claws
Now I'm crawling the mud to get back home
to the pleasuredome

Looking at all God's creatures
I'm not the brightest one
One in an angry crowd
come down to wave the gun"

Overwhelms me every time

And I'm reaching for You
Arms stretched towards You
All these things I bring
And You pursue me and I surrender
Take, Lord, what You see

Whatever the cost
I gained everything in loss
In the greatness of Your love
It compels me to give it up

In the light of what I see
There is nothing good in me"

In the morning
In the rain
Black as I was feeling and the street was slick and shiny as a snake
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo
Hangin' over in the brain
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take

Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard
And leavin' every yesterday behind
Learning every bridge you cross,
Is burning down before you're off and running
Like the devil just in time

Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Taking any comfort you can find
Running like you're running out of time
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding
When you're headin' for the border lord
You're bound to cross the line

Good lookin' women every time you stumble
Waitin' there to catch you when you fall
Gettin' to you bad enough to let em
Keep you backin' up till just before your back's against the wall

Breakin' any ties before they bind you
Takin' any comfort you can find
Runnin' like you're runnin' out of time
Take it all-take it easy-till it's over-understanding

You're bound to cross the line"

And if I'm yours and you forever mine
My name will by Zarepta when you come

And later what was lost will be returned
You'll satisfy your longing by my side
A love forever new and old as legends
And like Elisha God bids you abide

And if I'm yours and you forever mine

There he sits all alone on the sidewalk

Hoping that you won't pass him by


Should you stop? better not, much too busy

You're in a hurry, my how time does fly

And your cell phones and toys

See you every couple months when the band's in town
And we're gone the next day
I don't even have the time to see if you're okay
I could never be
A figure of dependence or authority
Please forgive me

What we all need is some stability

With a lethal little bite that you can't regulate
And it takes all I've got
Not to yield to the venom and write you off

And some handmade, hide the haze
Behind the Cartier Rolls tinted
E'er word I speak I'm in it
Hip hop; we in it, from now until infinite
We like ten foster kids bringin' daddy business
We turn the heat up to Tae-Bo in the club we post the Guinness
We had the guard spook one of my gods then broke loose
Had to buck a clown, too much Crown with no juice

Dropped the kids at the mission, with a rose for the virgin
She knew he was gone for good

And that's still a long way from the place where we are
And if evil exists, it's a pair of train tracks
And the devil is a railroad car

Could have stayed somewhere but the train tracks kept going
And it seems like they always left soon
And the wolves that he ran with moaned low and painful
Sang sad miseries to the moon

It's a long way to Heaven, it's closer to Harrisburg
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
And if evil exists, it's a pair of train tracks
And the devil is a railroad car

Romero sank into a dream
He didn't make Heaven, he didn't make Harrisburg

The way you hit on me
How come you hit on me

Verse 2: I made believe that it 
Didn't really hurt me
Made believe that I only hurt myself
I beliveved you every time you
Said I'm sorry
Was too ashamed to tell
Someone I needed help

Bridge/Chorus

Breakx2: You don't know how 
You destroy my life
I thought I was supposed
To be your wife
And I can't even try to understand
What you think it takes to be a man

Vamp: Why'd you did it
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why
What about my children
What about the babies
What about family
You're supposed to be a
Husband
You know nothing good
Gone come to you
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
I'm so weary, I'm so weary
Can't believe you did this to me
Can't take it no more
Can't take it no more"

All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But the dirty streets in the city won't let me go (let me go, let me go)

All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But quarter ki's make G's that's all i know (all i know, all i know)

(Trick Daddy)
A hit of crack frock could get ya fucked up
A ki of coke could get you rich
but too much of this shit can get you stuck up
That's why it's best to deal wit a nigga that you know and chill wit
Case he flip the script, you know where he live at
Plus, the game don' came a long way
Yeah we don' lost a lot of niggas that was speedin down the wrong way
See these days these niggas squeeze triggas quicker than yo boys
Cuz they got guns bigger than yours
Plus ain't not more coppin out
You either ridin or tellin, if you ride then you ride forever
Born the son of a straight killa
Raised by a strong woman, I'll ride for my homies
So, can a nigga get a boooonnnd
Or do another nigga have to come along and raise my daughter......son
Your Honor, answer this question and be honest
If you lock me up for the summer will you support my momma?

(Chorus)

(Baby)
Ay ay, move on over (wooooo)
I sit and took over
2 clips, the AK holder
Brick taped to my bitch
Strapped on her shoulder
Raw grams in the trunk of a jag
Hard ounces stashed in my cadillac dash
It's drought season daddy, we huntin for riches
We fly like birds go divin for fishes
A known deep boy, the #1 Stunna
Got a hundred brick stash in the back of the Hummer
But on my block, a old tymer got shot
I didn't wanna do it but he was holdin my spot
I'm shittin on niggas, grandma got grams
She gave me a revolver, automatics get jammed
I'm *Hood Rich* nigga one feet in the sand
I'm one of a few niggas that beat the man

(Chorus)

(Mannie Fresh)
See, check it out, the dope game is a mother fucker, young man
I bet you yo lil ass ain't even got a gun man
You in the game now you know what you don' done man?
""Yeah, bruh but i gotta feed my son man""
A cutlass supreme, still a young nigga's dream
A solid lil bitch with a whole lot of cream
Well lil one looky here, who you scorin from?
Look, this some shit that'll leave a nigga body numb
Take that, the comeback is incredible
Get caught, then nigga it's federal
By the way, don't say no mother fuckin names
You listenin to me? Don't play no mother fuckin games
You know the rules of this shit
Fuck around and be one dead bitch
It's money and the power
Every second every hour
From sco' to the flo'
Bakin soda to the flour

Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

Lost in a river
That saturday night
Far away
On the other side
He was caught in the middle
Of a desperate fight
And she could'nt find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

All she saw
Was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times
By a man on the run
And she could'nt find how to push through

I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven
One day

4 am in the morning
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

Star was glowing in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she could'nt find how to push through

I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven
One day"

Se me quedo un poco abierto

Me doy cuenta que empiezo a ceder
Y me asusta saber el camino por donde pase
No pens enamorarme otra vez
Porque cuando lo hice sufri
Pero es facil llegarte a querer
Y a pesar de tratar no consigo dejarte de amar
Yo me jure no entregarme al amor
Como lo hice algun dia
Jure que seria conmigo egoista
Pero no cont con tu cara tan linda

I see no point of it in the life of me
it hurts me too much 
can you feel what I feel?
it must go deep
my own soul is my enemy

it seems like everything I do just pushes down
it leaves an open scar that I know will never heal
broken promises now run through my head
I cant see the future and it all turns black

whats the point of being here
when this ? is riding me down

It all comes down to creating time
You don't always have to make it rhyme
We'll all drive by in our hybrid lives
Chances are we'll make it back

I was doing time in the LA jail
My crime was living inside a failure
No matter how it don't matter now
Rest assured the rest is blurred

We don't always have to make it a crime

51,Eminem,Hailie's Song,TRBKFKL128E078ED76,2002,"Yo, I can't sing it.
I feel like singin'.
I wanna fuckin' sing.
'Cause I'm happy.
Yeah, I'm happy. (Haha)
I got my baby back.
Yo, check it out.

Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry

Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl, keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side

I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her

Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul

And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?

Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man it's too bad, coulda had someone else

But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman

Man I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie

So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin'on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo! 
I told you I can't sing.
Oh well, I tried.
Hailie, 'member when I said ""If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?""
Well guess what?
Daddy's here. And I ain't goin' nowhere baby.
I love you."

So it's my destiny to bear this fate
They say that I'm still young but I'd better hurry up
And they're talking 'bout change
And it's a little too late 

I'm really not just jumping to conclusions
It's all a matter of fact clear of illusions
You'll never love me the way I love you
So I'm paying the price
All my life

Just when I think I'm moving along
You come back singing a different song
A song of love, a song of sweet regret
Full of promises which are never met
And I'm paying the price
All my life

I know I'll love you still when I have grown old
Though you'll have taken all of my good years
And you'll have taken every chance away from me
My master for life
All my life

Just when I think you'll let me be
I'll awake knowing you've been haunting me
All day long I'll hear you singing in my head
The voice I love, the voice I dread
And I'm paying the price
All my life

Just when I think I'm finally free
I hear a voice gently calling me
Saying I'm just a little melody
What could be the harm in writing me?
And I'm paying the price
All my life

And I'm paying the price
All my life
Paying the price
All my life
Paying the price"

Try to fight it back while my faith is torn apart

Yeah, it really took me back
Can't believe how long it's been
Took you awhile to recognize me
Oh, imagine that
When we were so close back then

No, nothing stays the same
Love, oh it slips away, it slips away

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?
It's amazing how time flies
Turning the pages of yesterday, hey
And in only the blink of an eye
Everything changes, everything changes

Somewhere I still have a picture
You were in that party dress
I remember dancing slow
Thought those days would last forever
How soon we forget
And how far away they go

No, nothing stays the same
Love, oh it fades away, it fades away

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?
It's amazing how time flies
Turning the pages of yesterday, hey
And in only the blink of an eye
Everything changes, everything changes

We try to hold it in our hands
But love falls through like grains of sand
One day it's there and then it's gone, gone, gone, gone

Everything changes, doesn't it baby?

Turning the pages of yesterday, hey

It's not just a dream

A hint of a smile
As your hand touches mine
No longer alone
I feel them entwine

Ah ah ah... Eventually

I'm holding your hand
You say quietly
Baby don't go
Stay here with me

So this is it
To you I belong
No more goodbyes
We knew all along

Ah ah ah... Eventually

Open you eyes shhh...

I got a fist full of dollars and a one track mind
I gotta find what I'm looking for in the dead of night
3rd and 4e buildings to the sky I've got one last chance to get high to get high
New York City might be the place to be
If your game is tight and if your green takes flight
Take another chance on the place that don't sleep
Creep on the sidewalks listen as she sleeps 
I'm back and I'm down for whatever Tribe Called Quest is in the CD player
Trik Turner bill boards in Time Square
No west coast G's just east coast players
Strike up a Newport sippin on my import gotta get that buzz
For them clubs that be what I see
Ok MCs in my pathway better make room I'm divin' deep into the groove

It's been a long time since I got down
Been a long time since I got down baby
So take a look around it ain't nothing nice
If your caught slippin' just another
Day in the life of that New York living
Where fast times makes for fast ways 
In and out with the latest craze
It takes more than the average to amaze
The typical New Yorker can make you 
Or break you either way it changes you
To something that you thought you'd never be
From rags to riches or riches to rags
Everyone plays a part you can see on
The faces of places and things that you've
Never seen it's all about the dollar dream
Owning millions have a penthouse in the tallest
Buildings I'm going all the way forget what
The critics say its all about them royalties
If you don't like it then suck on these!

(Hook)
I said I'm back in the New York Groove
I said I'm back in the New York Groove!

Pull up the 6 4 and open the door 
We got models galore never seen us before
We swoop about ten and pick up a friend
We sticken shorties that kid prince
Taught me naughty this click is chillin
Yo we top billin' 
New York Groove is how we livin'

Fading away from a dream
A shelter for me
Listening to the voices through the wall
Trying to figure out the place
Where I am though I've seen them all

Remembering yesterday
How we pulled it off again
And later hit the highway

As I take the stage I realize
That my life has meaning

Here I am
I have to sing it out
The feelings I had inside 
For so many years
Here is my chance
I have to take it
Reaching out to the people
Who have come to see the show

I see the hands in the air
Feeling the energy
That we share

When the day is done
And I'm on my own
I feel tired and satisfied

Here I am

When the plane went down
When the president was born
When they founded this town

She could hardly hear the band

My bird of freedom
With a gun in her hand

The parade in her eye
Hungry &amp; hot
Like the fourth of July
What is it about her 
That you don't under stand

My bird of freedom
With a gun in her hand
My bird of freedom
With a gun in her hand

Don't look back now guys
As she waves and she gets small
With those sweet wings that beat
Those sweet wings at night
It ain't no choice at all

Are you cool and dry 
Are you keeping warm
Shadow boxing
This thunder storm
Write me and tell me 
Where we fit in what is planned

Who will tend the sheep now and see them neatly shorn?
The stack that's in the haggard, unthrashed it may remain
Now that Johnny's gone a-thrashing all in the wars of Spain

The girls from the bawnogue in sorrow may retire
And the piper with his bellows may go home and blow the fire
For Johnny, lovely Johnny is sailing o'er the main
Along with the other patriots to fight the King of Spain

The boys will surely miss him when Moneymore comes around
And they'll weep that their bold captain is nowhere to be found
And the peerlers may stand idle, all against their will and main
Since the gallant boy who gave them work now peels the King of Spain

At wakes and hurling matches your like we'll never see
Till you come back to us again a stor gra geal mo chroi
Then won't you thrash the buckeens that show us such disdain
Because our eyes are not so bright as those you'll see in Spain

If cruel fate should not allow our Johnny to return
His heavy loss we Bantry girls will never cease to mourn
We'll resign ourselves to our sad lot and live in grief and pain
Since Johnny died for freedom's sake in the foreign land of Spain"

Et nous passons de longues nuits

Faudra-t-il que j'y prenne goût
Ou que je réagisse?

Que j'ai versé de larmes
Si parfois je la répudie
Jamais elle ne désarme
Et si je préfère l'amour

'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back, back?
Back again, gain, gain
Shady's back, back, back
Tell a friend

Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, la, la, la

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat wit'
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Feeling's getting stronger

I wanna to take you higher
Baby baby baby light my fire

Music's still flashing me

Don't ya, Don't ya wanna get higher?
Do ya want to get higher?
Baby baby light my fire
Do ya want to get higher?

82,Carly Simon,Christmas Is Almost Here,TRSJXHZ12903CCA81A,2002,"Christmas Is Almost Here
(Livingston Taylor)

There's a hand that's old and rough
And it's holding on
To one that's new and small
Whose life has just begun
Hand in hand
Young and old
Calm each others fears
Christmas is almost here

There's a rocky road ahead
Two people walk alone
Wondering in the fading light
If they can find their home
When hope is almost gone
A distant light appears
Christmas is almost here

Almost here for those in doubt
For those who must remain
Left behind when love goes cold
And shifting life makes change
Almost here for dreamers
Who think that there's a chance
That they will find their music
And a partner for the dance
There's a dream that doesn't die

Now we walk as one
Justice has a gentle hand
And love is like the sun
The darkest night is past
And by the stars we steer
Christmas is almost here
Christmas is almost here"

I remember sunny days
Chillin' on the beach
And catchin' rays
Shell toed shoes the girls would wear
Pink bikinis everywhere
Listenin' to CDs after dark
Outkast blastin' Rosa Parks
There's so much that we've been through
There's still so much more to do

Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me

To all the girls that I can't wait to see
To all the girls who've held it down for me
To all the girls who gave me memories
I wanna thank you for being good to me

Nana...
(Being good to me)
Nana...
Nana...
I wanna thank you for being good to me

Sometimes I sit and reminisce
Of all the hot girls that I miss
Tank tops with the low-cut jeans
All the guys know what I mean
Hip-hop style to retro rock
All the girls that's on my block
You've been down with me since one
And we've only just begun

Growing up can be so strange
But some things will never change
To all the girls that had my back
I'm with you and it's like that

To all the girls that sang along with me
To all the girls you're where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea

Come on
Jump Jump (2x)

So let me hit you with one more
Baby I'll see you out on tour
And we can do it all again
Until then...(woooo)

To all the girls where I wanna be
To all the girls from here across the sea
I wanna thank you for being good to me
To all the girls that I can't wait to see

84,Shadows Fall,Stepping Outside The Circle,TROVIRT12903CEED92,2002,"Here I go again
A vicious Cycle without end
Seeking distance for security
A desperate act to remain free
A balance point cannot be found
This whole thing will come crashing down
Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Into this world that I create
Your love for me has sealed your fate
Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Can I trust in what I feel?
Praying that this time it's real
Feel the strain!
All this times been spent in vain my shame!
open wounds that still remain decay!
As my faith is stripped away you'll stray!
The final price I have to pay

Digger in deeper still
The hollowness I yearn to fill
The story always ends the same
The cycle soon begins again

Stepping outside the circle!"

86,Fred Astaire,We Saw the Sea,TRAZWVU12903CB72CA,2002,"We joined the navy to see the world
And what did we see? We saw the sea
We saw the Pacific and the Atlantic
But the Atlantic isn't romantic
And the Pacific isn't what it's cracked up to be

We joined the navy to do or die
But we didn't do and we didn't die
We were much too busy
Looking at the ocean and the sky

And what did we see? We saw the sea
We saw the Atlantic and the Pacific
But the Pacific isn't terrific
And the Atlantic isn't what it's cracked up to be

They tell us that the admiral
Is as nice as he can be
But we never see the admiral
Because the admiral has never been to sea

We joined the navy to see the girls
And what did we see? We saw the sea
Instead of a girl or two in a taxi
We were compelled to look at the Black Sea
Seeing the Black Sea isn't what it's cracked up to be

Sailing, sailing home again
To see the girls upon the village green
Then across the foam again
To see the other seas we haven't seen

We owe the navy an awful lot
For they taught us how to do the sailor's hornpipe
And they showed us how to tie a sailor's knot
But more than that, they showed us the sea

We never get seasick sailing the ocean
We don't object to feeling the motion
We're never seasick but we are awful sick of sea"

Just makin up my mind to be,

What I thought others could see.
Good luck and those fast bucks
Are too few, and too far between,
Those other Cadillac drivers
And those old five and dimers like me.

You know, she stood beside me,
Tellin me she would be something to lean on,
When everything ran out on me.
No fenced yards ain t hole cards
Like as not, never will be.
Any reason for rhymers
And those old five and dimers like me.

Now I ve searched for so long,
Now that I ve found that I believe
All that I do or say
Is all I ever will be.
Too far and too high and too deep
Ain t too much to be.
Yeah, too much just ain t enough
For those old five and dimers like me.

Is all I intended to be."

Sur des vallons perdus, des plages inattendues
De mes petits papiers vous êtes le plus chair
Je suis tout à l´envers; tout à vous, je perds pied
Sans vous le dire, je vous fais des aveux sans voix
Vous vous prêtez au jeu

En vers et contre vous, je vous écris partout
Des mots de tous les jours sur vos joues de velours
Je grave en gravissant votre mont de Vénus
Des cœurs et des serments, dazibaos, laïus
J´écris la météo, là où tu mets tes bas
Voilà qu´à cet endroit précis je te tutoie
Comme un drôle de tatou
Je vous écris : je, vous; vous envahis et vous

I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home

folks think I'm big in Detroit city
From the letters I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars
And by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines

You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
After all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride put on a southbound train and ride
And go on back to the loved ones the ones I left there waiting so far behind

Y'alls a fool, oh woo

Why am I the one with aches and pains still taking trains
Making pays, taking great leaps of faith
I'm the world's greatest durable mammal ain't nothing safe
With the ""Lime Green"" phantom but when face-to-face
With the best of y'all thrown in my path
It's hard to be the nice guy, I'd rather show you my wrath
Everything's so patterned and wrinkled it's disgusting
Plus most music today sucks trust me

I'll be cool, oh woo

But that's another issue let me rip you off of this (?)
Cash ain't sticking, ex-girl tripping
The next girl drive me up a wall she a chicken
Sticking to kicking them out of my life
It's like a sticky predicament I'm proud of my vice
But yo, the only thing I trust is my crew the
Battleaxe Warriors bitch I thought you knew

Like who's doing what to make my shit poppers useless (useless)
Certain people slept and missed the train
When they should have just puckered up and just kissed my brain
I'm a full-grown genius with music
The west coast most prolific was high producing
Ain't nobody do shit for themselves
We did so we sell while y'all sit on the shelves
Ain't nothing bohemian no knowledge of elves
Ain't cutting graffiti Kangols and Gazelles

You don't seem to realize the cost
Living life as if your eyes are crossed
And I ain't really surprised at all
You could never keep your fingers crossed
Some things just meant to be and eventually
And if you can't deal with thatI can't help you
I spent tedious hours while the world sour
The things I do just to get away from you
Trying to pull that now or never, it's never going down
But your crazy ass almost put me back to level ground
(Y'alls a fool, oh woo)
You can't trick me, telling me you did lickity-split
I'm out clickity-click it's that simple
Don't try to invade the planet temple
I'm outta there without a care or my underwear

I don't want to do as I should
And I'm tired of hearing you say

Who's a naughty boy?
You're a naughty boy
Yes you are, yes you are
Yes you are, yes you are.

I'm uncertain to a certain extent
Exactly what you feel for me
First you came and then you went
Pleasing me, teasing me.

Who's a naughty boy?
You's a naughty boy
Yes you is, yes you is
Yes you is, yes you is.

I've got to talk to you intelligently
I have to talk with you
So let's seriously consider . .

Are we simply wasting our time
When we could be otherwise engaged?
Are you his or am you mine
Will you tell me before I'm enraged?

Who's a naughty boy?
I'm a naughty boy
Yes I am, yes I am
Yes I am, yes I am.

Who's a naughty boy?
I'm a naughty boy

I went inside and looked around and all I saw
The note she left was to the point it's you she wants
And her that you want too

I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you maybe my old self would
My new self won't

And since the incident I haven't been the same
I went inside and looked around and played the game
I tried to hold you up but crashing down you came
Now what'd you come to do

Or I'll just read it from the lines across your face
Or from the way your hands are all over the place
I'll take a picture of you with me just in case
I can't remember you

I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you maybe my old self would
My new self won't

I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you maybe my old self would
My new self won't

Open up the door and let me in
Oh things are not the way they should have been

I see a car out on the distance
And my hands are going numb
I see a car out on the distance
It's the reason that I've come

I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you just so you know
I can't forgive you maybe my old self would

Where you're walking naked down the street
And everyone just stares
Do you ever feel so deep
That you speak your mind
To put others straight to sleep
You wonder if anybody cares
Sometimes I think I'm the only one
Whose day turned out unlike it had begun

And I feel bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
cause I'm bare naked
And i know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day

Do You ever go downstairs to start your day
But your car's not there
Yeah you know the joke's on you
You ever try your luck with a pickup line
But you just sucked
You tell yourself it wasn't you
And I know it's hard to hold it inside
It's days like these I run and hide

When I feel bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
Cause I'm bare naked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day

It's all a state of mind
But I don't mind trying to find a way
To keep my head above the mess I make
What the world creates
Sometimes it feels so good to let it all fall
As the world fall
I may fall
We all may fall
And then the world comes tumbling
Down down down down down

I'm bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
Cause I'm bare naked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away

You feel
We all feel

he kneels before you, 
Let this being outside of your rage and your hits 
He proclaims himself: 'Holy Knight' 

When he opened his trembling arms, 
freeing himself of the oppression 
Which gripped him, he saw the rising spirits around him 

I implore all of you, I kneel before you, before you 
Cause it's against you, brothers, I will fight 
I'll fight for having desecrated the flesh, the flesh 
Of the being for whom I live 
For whom I'm ready to die 

Under an unexplained spell, he moved forward 
To the illuminated candled altar, he fused with the hot magic wax 

And when, slowly, he consumed himself, human life leaving him 
A being for whom I live 
A being for whom I'm ready to die"
107,The Extra Glenns,Going to Marrakesh,TRAZRSZ12903CA5BDF,2002,"The fog is lifting from the water.
The bells are sounding on the boats
And our love is a monster, plain and simple
Though you weigh it down with stones to try to drown it,
It floats
It floats

The day of reckoning is coming.
Faster than anyone here realises
And our love is like Jesus but worse
Though you seal the cave up where you've lain it's body
It rises
It rises

I keep waiting for our love to die
The machines by it's bed
Dim and flicker but it won't stay dead
And it perks up when the nurses bring it's medication by.

I wish
Our love could go the way of all flesh.
But it's not right and it's not nice
To try to kill the same thing twice
Would you pack your things?
We are going to Marrakesh"

looking for a place to stay.
No matter where you go
they say that you can't stay.

You can't decide what's wrong or right,
frustration overcomes the pride.
You only want some sleep,
you only want to spend the night.

It is tragic to hope for magic,
it is tragic, so dramatic.
Yes, it is tragic to hope for magic,
it is tragic, so dramatic.

A stranded stranger masqueraded
noble gestures complimenting.

My sentiment, temptation's hand,
I know you think you're clever
since you tell me vivid lies
that I believe and then repeat to feel alright.

It seems like nothing mattered

until one day it happened...

Who has taken you far from my land?
Who has said that my sayings were wrong?
Who will say that I stayed much too long?

Clothes of sand have covered your face
Given you meaning, but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me

Does it now seem worth all the color of skies
To see the earth through painted eyes?
To look through panes of shaded glass
See the stains of winter's grass?

Clothes of sand have covered your face
Given you meaning, but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me

Can you now return to from where you came?
Try to burn your changing name
Or with silver spoons and colored light
Will you worship moons in winter's night?

Clothes of sand have covered your face
Given you meaning, but taken my place
So make your way on down to the sea
Something has taken you so far from me

Clothes of sand have covered your face
Given you meaning, but taken my place

Or just another thing to pull me under? 
If you could give me anything tonight 
Just a wink, or even just a sigh 
I'll be okay, 'cause I've been waiting for a sign 
I've been waiting for a sign, to come 
Are you the one? 

And I was breathless on a Sunday morning 
And I was speechless on a Sunday night 
For a lack of better understanding 
Felt like an engine that just didn't need a tire 
I see your face, I hear your voice 
I touch the screen and wonder 
And I been waiting for the sun to tell me

I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
To share what seems to be the life
That you could cherish me as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think
That man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear
Make you see
That you're driving me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who say they'd love you
With all the rest of their lives
When all they wanted was to
Touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
 
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Dead Head sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said,
""Don't look back. You can never look back.""
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you-
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

und sagt S-A-V-A-S, der Rest braucht nicht mehr zu reimen,
Denn ich allein vereine alle in einem.
Ich bring, Raps und Bam
Du willst batteln, doch dein Rap ist zu arm.
Wenn ihr mich noch nicht kennt, merkt euch jetzt meinen Namen
und sagt S-A-V-A-S, der Rest braucht nicht mehr zu reimen,
Denn ich allein vereine alle in einem."
123,Dredg,Convalescent,TRKSQAW128F148B2D7,2002,"This lonely old man had heart
Resting gray hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it

Unaware of his surroundings
Youth, it passed
Swarming like wolves to a fresh kill
The scent attracts
He's just scared about dying

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave your severed view of it
It's the only way to understand it

To believe that
To think back
To realize that
Those sad days have come to an end
Where are those
Where they all have been gone

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
To understand it"
124,Utopia Banished,Desolate Winds,TRGTMGJ128F92D5A5B,2002,"I dream of you in sleepless nights
Aware of the unknown light
The look on your face as the silence thickens
A desolate place of solace and awakening
Falling back on what you know
A false reality appears below

A sacred touch to the unknown
We'll elapse and quiver in a world of our own
A moment of serenity will hail us all
In the darkest of hours we seize the fall

Follow me to an unknown land
We'll be gone for a while
The truth beholds of what's untold
My pain and suffering now unfolds
The essence of silence I now endure
Embraced by illusions beyond my control

Deep within the misty fields
Lies a creature awaiting
The dawn of it's arrival
Years have passed
Since his last attack, and his time is now here
A northern breeze billows through the air
And time is long but not forgotten
An eerie mist, once again sets in
Traveling smoothly
In the Desolate Winds

Follow me to an unknown land
We'll be gone for a while
A sacred touch to the unknown
We'll elapse and quiver in a world of our own
A moment of serenity will hail us all
In the darkest of ours we seize the fall"
125,Afterhours,Il Mio Ruolo,TRKDEAQ128F149785F,2002,"Ti ho vista spergiurare che lo seguirai
Nel vento e nella neve per lui morirai
Ma il mio ruolo è il pensiero malvagio
Che ti porta via con se
Perchè se vuoi i colori
Stai attenta a te
La notte è la sorella, può nasconderti
Quando fra le sue braccia riesci ad accenderti
Proprio mentre un pensiero malvagio
Ti porta dritto a me
Perchè tu vuoi i colori
Stai attenta a te
Nella neve e nel gelo
Stai attenta a te"
