0,Acker Bilk / Leon Young String Chorale,Sentimental Journey,TRXAQXB128F147774B,1961,"I'm gonna take a Sentimental Journey,
Gonna set my heart at ease.
Gonna make a Sentimental Journey,
To renew old memories.

I got my bags, I got my reservations,
Spent each dime I could afford.
Like a child in wild anticipation,
Long to hear that, ""All aboard!""

Seven, that's the time we leave at seven.

I'll be waitin' up at heaven,
Countin' every mile of railroad track, that takes me back.

I never knew my heart could be so yearny.
Why did I decide to roam?
I'm gonna take that Sentimental Journey,
Sentimental Journey home.
Sentimental Journey."

2,Ben E. King,Stand by Me,TRWCWXU12903CD9321,1961,"When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darlinâ€™, darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me
Stand by me

Darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me

Won't you stand now?
Oh, stand, stand by me
When all of our friends is gone"
3,Ben E. King,This Magic Moment,TRZIVQY12903CEA102,1961,"This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by suprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time

Oh...
Oh...
Mm...

Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time

Oh...
Magic moment...
Magic moment...
Magic moment..."
4,Ben E. King,Perfidia (LP Version),TRTJWJH128F427599F,1961,"To you
My heart cries out ""Perfidia""
For I find you, the love of my life
In somebody else's arms

Your eyes are echoing ""Perfidia""
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're sharing another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now, I know* my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidious one, Goodbye

With a sad lament my dreams are faded like a broken melody
While the gods of love look down and laugh
At what romantic fools we mortals be

And now, I know* my love was not for you
And so I take it back with a sigh
Perfidious one, goodbye
Goodbye"
5,Ben E. King,Amor,TRJEJNV12903CFE8ED,1961,"Amor, Amor, Amor,
This word so sweet
That I repeat
Means I adore you.
Amor, Amor, My love,
Would you deny
This heart that I
Have placed before you?
I can't find another word with meaning so clear;
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear.
But somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know.

Amor, Amor, My love,
When you're away,
There is no day
And nights are lonely.
Amor, Amor,
My love, Make life divine,
Say you'll be mine
And love me only.

Amor,
Amor,
Amor,
Naci de t,
Naci de m,
De la esperanza.
Amor,
Amor,
Amor,
Naci de Dios,
Para los dos,
Naci del alma.
Sentir que tus besos anidaron en m,
Igual que palomas mensajeras de luz.
Saber que mis besos se quedaron en t,
Haciendo en tus labios la seal de la cruz.
Amor,
Amor,
Amor,
Naci de t,
Naci de m,
De la esperanza.

6,Bill Evans Trio,Waltz For Debby,TRTKBUC128F932845E,1961,"In her own sweet world
Populated by dolls and clowns
And a prince and a big purple bear

Lives my favorite girl,
Unaware of the worried frowns
That we weary grown ups all wear

In the sun she dances to silent music,
Songs that are spun of gold
Somewhere in her own little head

One day all too soon
She'll grow up and she'll leave her dolls
And her prince and her silly old bear

When she goes they will cry
As she whispers ""Good-bye.""
They will miss her I fear
But then so will I"
7,Bill Monroe,Kentucky Waltz,TRGZZGV12903C98676,1961,"We were waltzing that night in Kentucky

As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz"
8,Bill Monroe,Footprints In The Snow,TRCEDPF12903CE4BBF,1961,"Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow on the ground

I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories
For I found her when the snow was on the ground"
9,Bill Monroe,Blue Moon of Kentucky,TRITCPF128F930A6D1,1961,"Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one whose gone and left me blue

It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one gone and said goodbye!"
10,Billy Fury,Halfway To Paradise,TRMYHNL128F932529A,1961,"I want to be your lover
But your friend is all I've stayed
I'm only halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away

I long for your lips to kiss my lips
But just when I think they may
You lead me halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away, mmm

Bein' close to you is almost heaven (heaven)
But seein' you can do just so much
It hurts me so to know your heart's a treasure (treasure)
And that my heart is forbidden to touch, so

Put your sweet lips close to my lips
And tell me that's where they're gonna stay
Don't lead me halfway to paradise
Mmm, so near, yet so far away

Oh, oh, oh so near, yet so far away
Mmm, so near, yet so far away"

12,Bob Gibson,Trouble In Mind (LP Version),TRQNDIV128F4236EF9,1961,"Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday.

Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name.
Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday.

I'm gonna lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind.

You,ve been a mean and evil woman
You sure treat me unkind
I'm gona be your hare hearted daddy
I'm gonna make you loose your mind

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always.
Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away!"
13,"Bobby ""Blue"" Bland",Two Steps From The Blues,TRQQNCG128F424C42E,1961,"One month from the day I first met you
Your promises proved to be untrue
So step by step, I've been a fool
Now I'm just two steps from the blues

The reason we didn't get along
Was telegrams and telephone
One brings bad news, the other rendezvous
That keeps me two steps from the blues

Here is a chance to be loved or be lonely
My heart awaits your call
I know it's better to have loved and lost
Than never have loved at all

So, darling, let's try to make amends
And if it should fail, let's try and try again
Oh, it makes no difference what you say or do
I'm so forgiving, I'm so forgiving
And I can't go on living two steps from the blues"
14,"Bobby ""Blue"" Bland",St. James Infirmary,TRYMSMR128F424C42F,1961,"I went down to St. James Infirmary 
And I heard my baby moan. 
And I felt so broken hearted. 
She used to be my very own.
 
I tried so hard to keep from crying. 
My heart felt just like lead. 
She was all that I had to live for. 
Oh, I wish it was me instead. 

Now she's gone, she's gone and may God bless her 
Wherever she may be. 
She can search this wide world over 
Oh, but she'll never find a man like me. 
She's gone, she's gone... 
She's gone."
15,Bobby Bland,Little Boy Blue,TRXXFRQ128F92D1391,1961,"When I thought I was so high above you
You were so good to me
Even though you knew I didn't love you
You were still good to me

And when it used to make me happy to see you cry
You were so good to me and that's no lie

You used to call me, ""Bobby, Little Boy Blue""
You said, ""Blow your horn baby, Little Boy Blue""
You used to call me ""Bobby, Bobby""
So nice to me baby, oh yes, you were

I remember, baby, when you cried all night long
I know now, darling, that I was doing you wrong
If I had a million dollars I'd give you every, a-every dime
Just to hear you call me, ""Bobby"", one more time

You used to call me B O B B Y, B O B B Y
""Bobby"", you called me 'Bobby""'
Oh, it used to sound so good, oh yeah
You don't know how much I miss you lady, yeah, yeah

If you'd just give me one more chance, darling

Your kiss is so divine
Your eyes are like the skies of blue

Your voice is sweet like violins
And warm like summer days
I love you, I love you, I love you
In oh, oh, so many, many ways

Your touch is like a breath of spring
You give life to my soul
To me, sweetheart, you're everything
I ever hoped to hold

A smile from you lights up my heart
And brightens all my days

(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

Now there were three children from the land of Israel
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Ah, they took a little trip to the land of Babylon
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
And ol' Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
So they took a lot of gold, and made 'em an idol
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

And they told everybody 'when you hear the music of the clarinet,'
They told everybody 'when you hear the music of the flute,'
'Now listen, children, when you hear the music of the horn,'
'Ah, you gotta bow down and worship the idol!'
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

Ah, but the children of Israel would not bow down!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
'We ain't goin' to bow to no golden idol!'
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
No, you couldn't fool the children with the golden idol!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)

So the king cast the children in the fiery furnace
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
He heaped on coal and red-hot brimstone, the Good Book say
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Even made it seven times hotter than it oughtta be!
(Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!)
Now they burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
(Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!)
Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!

Um hmm, then the Good Lord called an angel,
Gave him a couple of wings.
He said 'go down there through the middle of the furnace
and begin to coolin' the flames.'
And those children got so happy, 
they went struttin' right through the fire.
And this lot they had them talkin' about the power of the gospel.

Oh, Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!!!"

When you broke our precious vows
But I can't stop loving you
I know it's too late to turn back now

Though I said, ""Go on, be happy, bless you, child""
I thought you could guess somehow
My secret heart was saying
""Man, it's too late to turn back now""

Was I a fool from the start
Building castles in the skies?
Or did I just dream I saw
Heaven shining in your eyes?

If you knew how much I love you, yes, I do
Oh, my darling, your heart would bow
Mmm, yes, you'd know, you'd know why I have said
""It's too late to turn back now""

These are the ties that bind

Can I say more than this, my love?
I live just for your kiss, my love

I look at the skyline, I look at the trees
I look at the moonlight, I feel the soft breeze
Then I wanna know
Why can't I find a love of my own

Love, how I've waited for you
But it looks like you'll never come
So I sit down, sit down and think the thing over
Is it something I've done?

I look at the flowers in fullest bloom
I should be happy but I'm filled with gloom

Why can't I find a love of my own

He's awful nice, it's paradise
I hope I'm not he's decoy

Heaven up above knows how much
I love that gentle soul
Angels sing of a love like this

Darling we're the young ones,
And young ones shouldn't be afraid.

To live, love
While the flame is strong,
For we won't be the young ones very long.

Tomorrow,
Why wait till tomorrow,
Tomorrow sometimes never comes.
Love, me,
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young.

Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this.
I need you and you need me.
Oh my darling can't you see.
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together,
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid.
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, this will teach the young ones of our own.
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones."

Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery

Step by step you put me down
Always calling me a clown
If you ever go away
Promise that you'll stay

I guess we're both to blame
We tried to break each other's hearts

Crazy clothes, anything goes on a weekend
John called Ann and Jim got Sue
And I made a date with little ol' you
Off we went to make a big tent on the weekend

Boy, it's great just a-stayin' out late on a weekend
Know a spot and like it a lot on a weekend
Took a road to lookout hill
The view up there is sure a thrill
What a night to hold you tight on a weekend

There we were just sittin' cool and cozy
Just about to steal a little kiss
The police with a flashlight bright and nosy
Sayin', ""Holdin' neck o'er there, what is all this?""

Car top down, just ridin' around on a weekend
Took a chance on crashin' a dance on a weekend
We were almost inside the place
When somebody slammed the door in my face
""Hey, you guys have gotta wear ties on a weekend!""

No harm done, just a-havin' some fun on a weekend
That was all, we had a big ball on the weekend"

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.

(Musical interlude)

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats - how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality - step up, wake up to reality?
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin.
Yes, I've got you under my skin."

When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon AND under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you
NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
NIGHT AND DAY, NIGHT AND DAY
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And ITS torment won't be through
'TIL you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day"

Yet resurrected and sailing the crest.
Why this elation, mixed with deflation?
What explanation? I am in love.

Such conflicting questions rise
around in my brain: Should I order cynanide
or order champagne?

Oh, what is this sudden jolt?
I feel like a frightened colt,
just hit by a thunderbolt. I am in love.

I knew the odds were against me before,
I had no flair for flaming desire,
But since the gods gave me you to adore,
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire,

So come and enlighten my days and never depart.
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart,
For I am wildly in love with you,
and so in need of a stampede of love.

At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
The times without number
Darling that I say to you

Do you love me 
As I love you
Are you my life to be
My dream come true
Or will that dream of mine fade out of sight
Like the moon growing dim
On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night"
43,Ella Fitzgerald,Begin The Beguine,TRNUWHJ128F9303227,1961,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
Darling, I love you!
And we suddenly know What heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine"
44,Ella Fitzgerald,I Get A Kick out Of You,TRTTPOY12903CF3C81,1961,"My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me, you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you"
45,Ella Fitzgerald / Louis Armstrong,Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love),TRAZUPM128F1496556,1961,"Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it

Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish, do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter bring me
""shad roe""

In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Transcribed (from the stated recording) by Todd Peach &lt;todd@thepeaches.com&gt;
Other verses I've seen in print follow:

In old Japan, all the Japs do it
Up in Lapland little Laps do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The chimpanzees in the zoos do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it, let's
fall in love

I'm sure giraffes on the sly do it
Even eagles as they fly do it
Let's do it, let's fall
in love

Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks em I know
Why ask if shad do it - garcon de
""shad roe""

The world admits bears in pits do it
Even Pekingeses at the Ritz do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The royal set sans regret did it
And they considered it fun
Marie Antoinette did it -
with or without Napoleon"

Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more I'll share
Now he's gone I'm alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date

I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date

Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my baby's eye
Walked away didn't know that
I'd soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn't see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last date"

Yes, I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing

Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage

The young have problems Many problems
We need an understanding heart..
Why don't they help us, try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...

Take these eager lips and hold me fast..
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last

(Big John)

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245 
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip
To Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all you just said ""hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fella to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast 
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above.""
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
And now there's only one left down there to save
Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line
For Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit 
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
""At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man...
Big John""

Dreaming of your amber skies 
Was a poor boy broken hearted 
Listening to the winds that sigh

My little darling, oh how, I love you 
How I love you, none can tell 
In your heart you love another 
Little darling, pal of mine 

Many a day, with you I've rambled
Happiest hours, with you I've spent 
For I had your heart forever 
But I find it's only lent 

There is just three things I wish for 
That's my casket, shroud and grave 
When I'm dead, don't weep for me 
Just like those lips that you betrayed"

I loved her as my life
I'd gladly give my heart and hand
To make her my wife
Ooh, to make her my wife

She took me by the hand
She led me to the door
She put her arms around me
Saying, ""Please don't come no more""
Ooh, Please, come no more

Well, I'd not been gone 
But about six months
When she did complain
And she wrote me a letter
Saying, ""please come back again.""
Ooh, Please, come again

So I sent her an answer
Just for to let her know
That no young man should venture
Where once he could not go
Ooh, Where once he could not go.

So come all you young lovers
Take a warning from me
And never hang your affections
On a green, growing tree
Ooh, on a green, growing tree

For the leaves they will wither
Roots will decay
And the beauty of a young girl
Will soon fade away
Ooh, will soon fade away"

Some pleasure there to find 
A damsel there from Lexington 
Was pleasing to my mind 
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips 
Like arrows pierced my breast 
And the name she bore was Flora 
The Lily Of The West 

I courted lovely Flora 
Some pleasure there to find 
She turned unto another man
Which sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty 
Deprived me of my rest 
Still I love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West 

Down in yonder shady grove 
A man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me 
And the answer that she gave to him
It sure did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora 
The Lily Of The West

I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar and
I boldly made him stand
Being mad to desperation I pierced him in the breast
All for my lovely Flora 
The Lily Of The West

I had to stand my trial
I had to make my plea
They placed me in the criminal box
And then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away
Deprived me of my rest
And I still love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West"

Saying, ""Here am I, thy bairn's father,
Although I be not comely.

""I am a man upon the land,
I am a silkie in the sea,
And when I'm far and far from land,
My home it is the sule skerrie.""

I'll come and fetch my little young son,

Saying my darling son be careful how you run 
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time 
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time 

Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed 
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash 
His head was against the firebox door the flames are rolling high

Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will 
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free 
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three

Sweet William on his death bed lay 
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town 
To the place where she was dwelling, 
Saying you must come, to my master dear 
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up 
And slowly she drew nigh him, 
And the only words to him did say 
Young man I think you're dying. 

He turned his face unto the wall 
And death was in him welling, 
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all 
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave 
She heard the death bells knelling 
And every stroke to her did say 
Hard hearted Barbara Allen. 

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died of love for me 
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died on yesterday 
And I will die tomorrow. 

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard 
Sweet William was buried beside her, 
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose 
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar. 

They grew and grew in the old churchyard 
Till they could grow no higher 
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot 
And the rose grew round the briar."

Spends his money foolishly and not on me

I ought to hate him but still I love him so
Cos I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind

Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

Call back my rose,

Like petals fallin apart,
Speak once again of my love, my own

Isabella and Ferdinand

Ferdinand:
That's Ferdinand and Isabella

Columbus and Ferdinand:
New rulers of this round, round world

Crew:
Crazy kind of scheme
It's a cockamamie dream
But we hope it's a round, round world

-----

Columbus:
Round, round world
It's a newfound world
And the land looks good
Like a continent should
Complete with a flag unfurled

Indians:
Yo ho ho and a buckskin sleeve
Now the white man's here, I guess
It's time to leave
But why go to war and fight like a jerk?
Perhaps we can pick up some kind of work
In an Indian extravaganza
Wyatt Earp or Bonanza

Columbus:
Please don't call us, we'll call you

Ferdinand:
Step aside, pal, meet the new

Columbus and Ferdinand:
Big cheeses of this round, round world"
132,Stan Freberg,Betsy Ross And The Flag,TRJEFVS128F426E25E,1961," George Washington: 
Look at the colors you chose
The best you could do, I suppose
A peppermint stripe with royal blue
The same as the British colors, too
Now how will we tell whose side is who?
Look at the colors you chose
Why couldn't it have been puce?
Lavender over chartreuse
Or possibly some exotic shade
A delicate orange, mauve, or jade
Instead of the choice that has been made
Why couldn't it have been possibly cinnamon?
 Betsy Ross: 
Everybody wants to be an art director
Everybody wants to call the shots
Everybody wants to be a flag dissector
Changing all my stars to polka dots
Everybody thinks that they're the final word
On what is strictly out and what is in
How'd you like a banner made of pea green spots
On simulated leopard skin
Or possibly a flag that features fleur-de-lis
On ocher corrugated tin?"

Where the trees stand so tall
And the dust turn to gold
And love never grows old

On Lover's Island
Where the birds sing of love
Seems a gift from up above
I met her one day
(Met her one day)

As we stood alone on the mountain
Under the moon and stars above
Oh, darling, don't ever go
She was Venus, the goddess of love

On Lover's Island
Where the trees stand so tall
And the dust turn to gold
And love never, never
Never, never grows old"
134,The Cadets,Stranded in the Jungle,TRGZSRI12903CD921E,1961,"I crashed into the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl, who was-a back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted, and my girl in lover's lane?

And meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, as mad as he can be
So, come on, pretty baby, just you and me

An' meanwhile, back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When somethin' heavy hit me, like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was a-cooking me

Great goo-ga-moo-ga
Lemme outta here

An' meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, as mad as he can be
So come on pretty, baby, just you and me

An' meanwhile, back in the jungle

I jumped out the pot, and I finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was getting mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
And when I got to lover's lane, I was almost dead
But my soul was gone, and here's what I said

Baby, baby, the man is no good
Oh, baby baby, you should have understood
You can trust me as long as you please
So, come back, pretty baby, where you used to be
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you	
'Cause I love you
