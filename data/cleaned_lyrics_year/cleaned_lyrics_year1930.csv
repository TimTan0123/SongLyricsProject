0,Big Bill Broonzy,Skoodle Do Do,TRQYLQY12903CE5E28,1930,"I mean I want skoodle do do
Baby want skoodle do do
You hear me talking about skoodle do do
Baby want skoodle do do

Got up this morning
About half past four
Somebody's knocking
On my back door

It must have been my little old sweet mama
She must've wanted skoodle do do with her daddy
She must've wanted skoodle do do

You hear me talking about skoodle do do
Baby want skoodle do do
Some of these mornings
Mama it won't be long
You going to call me baby
And I'll be gone

I know you're gonna miss your loving papa
Baby from skoodle do do somebody else

Your right foot in mama
Your left one out
Your time baby
And move your body about

Get me a picket
Off of my back fence
Whop you on your head
Until you learn some sense"
1,Big Bill Broonzy,I Can't Be Satisfied,TRUSWHY12903CF3810,1930,"Now listen here my baby
Tell you what I want you to do
Want you treat me mama
Like I do you

Because I can't be satisfied
And I can't be satisfied
And I can't mistreat her
Not to please nobody's mind

Now I love my sweety
Tell you the reason why
My baby got something
To satisfy my mind

Lord starvation's in my kitchen
Rent sign's on my door
Good girl told me
She can't use me no more

I'm leaking at the heart
Bleeding at the nose
Good girl told me
She can't use me no more

Got on my high‑cut stockings
Low cut shoes
Mama I ain't bettin'
And I sure can't lose

Now look a‑here boys
Ain't this rich
I got to pay my wife
For everything I get"

3,Charley Patton,Moon Going Down,TRZJALH128F4246803,1930,"Oh well, where were you now, baby
Clarksdale mill burned down
Oh well, where were you now, baby
Clarksdale mill burned down
I were way down Sunflower
With my face all fulla frowns

Lord, I think I heard the Helena whistle

Helena whistle blow
Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin'
Till I get in my rider's door"
4,Little Hat Jones,Kentucky Blues,TRGVUZO128F930C8DB,1930,"Well, whilst we here tryin' to have our fun, s'posin' the law jumped up and said ""Nobody run!""
Well you know I'm long gone, from Kentucky, long gone and then got away lucky
'Cus I'm gonna leave Seguine, I'll be just like a submarine

Well my woman poked her head out from way under the bed. She said ""Please don't let 'em kill Mr. Little Hat dead""
I said ""No use to worryin' sweet mama, ain't gonna be here long""
Don't waznn let you sing this worried song
'Cus I'm gonna leave Seguine, I'll be just like a submarine

Well I once have knowed the man they call him Austin Jack
Stop and put the bloodhounds right on my track
Course the blindest could not catch my scent
Do you know they couldn't tell where the Little Hat went
'Cus I left Seguine, people I's just like a submarine

Well yon' come the Santa Fe just puffin' and flyin'
Oughta seen me when I reached up and really caught them blind
They said ""There's another long gone, from Kentucky""
Long gone and then got away lucky
'Cus you left Seguine, you's just like a submarine

I'm gonna sing this song, ain't gonna sing no more
'Cus I'm leavin' San Antoine, I declare I ain't comin' here no more

Well I don't play the dozen and neither the ten
'Cus she keep on talkin' I'll ease ya in
Well you keep on talkin' 'till you make me mad
Well I tell you 'bout the mother that your father had
'Cus I don't play the dozen, I declare, man, and neither the ten"
5,Little Hat Jones,Bye Bye Baby Blues,TRVIZLB128F92E5600,1930,"Well it's bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye
Well I'll prob'ly never see you anymore, may God bless you everywhere you go
But it's bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye

Well I'm leavin' sweet baby, can't carry you
Said I'm leavin', sweet baby, don't you wanna go?
Well I'll prob'ly never see you anymore, may God bless you everywhere you go
But it's bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye

Well I tried to love my sweet woman, she couldn't understand
Said I tried to love my sweet woman, she didn't understand
Well I tried to love my sweet woman, but the woman didn't seem to understand
But I know she's realized it's trouble since she met another man

So it's bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye
Bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye
Well I'll prob'ly never see you anymore, may God bless you everywhere you go
For it's bye bye, pretty baby, baby bye bye"
6,Louis Armstrong,Rockin' Chair,TRAHZUK128F424BF7E,1930,"Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rockin' chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rockin' chair gets it, Judgement Day is here
Chained to my rockin' chair

Old rockin' chair's got me, son, (Rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side, (Yes, your cane by your side)

Just sittin' me here grabbin' (Grabbin')
At the flies round this old rockin' chair (Rockin' chair)

Now you remember dear old aunt Harriet, (Aunt Harriet)

7,Memphis Jug Band,Cocaine Habit Blues,TRWGSYD12903CEC349,1930,"Cocaine habit mighty bad
It's the worst old habit that I ever had
Hey, hey, Honey take a whiff on me

I went to Mr Beaman's in a lope
Saw a sign on the window said no more dope
Hey, hey, Honey take a whiff on me

If you don't believe cocaine is good
Ask Alma Rose at Minglewood
Hey, hey, Honey take a whiff on me

I love my whiskey, and I love my gin
But the way I love my coke is a doggone sin

Hey, hey, Honey take a whiff on me

Since cocaine went out of style
You can catch them shooting needles all the while
Hey, hey, honey take a whiff on me

It takes a little coke to give me ease
Strut my stuff long as you please
Hey, hey, honey take a whiff on me

(Let's all take a whiff on Hattie now)

Hey, hey"
8,Memphis Minnie,Bumble Bee,TRFZAFH128F92E7973,1930,"Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Please come back to me
He got the best old stinger
Any bumble bee that I ever seen

He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
He stung me this morning
I been looking for him all day long
Lord, it got me to the place
Hate to see my bumble bee leave home

Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
Bumble bee, bumble bee
Don't be gone so long
You's my bumble bee
And you're needed here at home

And you know your stuff
Oh, sting me, bumble bee
Until I get enough

Bumble bee, bumble bee

9,Mississippi Sheiks,Sitting On Top Of The World,TRHELZA128F92E3851,1930,"Was all the summer, and all the fall
Just tryin' to find my, little Lenore
But now she's gone, I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Then you come here runnin'
Holdin' up your hand
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

It have been days
I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain?
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Goin' to the station, down in the yard
Gon' get me a freight train
Worked some, got hard
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me and say goodbye?
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world"
10,Mississippi Sheiks,Stop And Listen Blues,TRCEHNJ128F92E3842,1930,"Ev'r day have been there
Long old lonesome day
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Ev'r day have been
Long old lonesome day
Cry, it seem like you-ooo would
Be there ooo-ooo, same old way

Cryin', smokestack lightning
That bell that shine like gold
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Ooh, smokestack lightning
Bells that shine like gold
Cryin', I found my baby
Layin' on the coolin' floor

Don't a hearse look lonesome, mama
Rollin' for yo' do'?
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Don't a hearse look lonesome
Rollin' for yo' do'?
Cryin' she's gone, tell you-ooo, Lord
Won't be-ee-ee back no mo'

Ooh, stop and listen
Hear how those bells in toll
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Ooh, stop and listen
Hear the bell it tolls
I had a sweet little faror
But she's dead and gone

Cryin', followed my baby down
To the buryin' ground
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
I followed my baby, to the buryin' ground
It was afternoon, mama
Standing all around you."
