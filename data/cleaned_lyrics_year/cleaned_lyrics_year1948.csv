0,Frankie Yankovic,Blue Skirt Waltz,TRZEEUF128F427F15F,1948,"I wondered alone one night.
Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
And people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
And softly you strolled away.

I dream of that night with you,
Lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
And blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.
Don't be blue anymore."
1,Hank Thompson,Green Light,TRXACXM128F92FB147,1948,"I turn your hole card upside down
I caught you cheatin' and runnin' around
There's a smile upon your face while another takes my place
And now at last dear the truth I'd found

Babe there's the green light you're free to go
You'll take a high road I'll take the low
Here's your coat and shoes and don't forget your blues
You're on canoe now you'll have to row
[ fiddle - guitar ]
Babe there's the green light shift your gear
I know you fooled me for all these years
I'll hold my head up high and forget you by and by
And there'll be laughter instead of tears
[ steel ]
Babe there's the green light kick up your heels
There'll come a day you know how it feels
To have your aces trump and be taken for a chump
Now there's the green light so spin your wheels"
2,Hank Williams,Rootie Tootie,TRMMVOA128F9321EE0,1948,"Met my future wife today
And her name is Kathy Mae
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Sunday gal.

Feelin' dandy, doin' swell
My gal is the village bell
Hotsy-totsy (Rootie Tootie)
Super-duper (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Monday gal.

You should see the people stare
When we walk around the square
Bouncy-bouncy, (Rootie Tootie)
Upsy-daisy, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Tuesday gal.

I'm not jealous, no siree
Just as long as she's with me
Wicky-wacky, (Rootie Tootie)
Humpty-dumpty, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Wednesday gal.

She's got ""purty"" eyes of blue
And she thinks I'm ""purty"", too
Tootsie-wootsie, (Rootie Tootie)
Hunky-dory, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Thursday gal.

Gonna make that lady mine
When she signs that dotted line
Hinky-dinky, (Rootie Tootie)

Rootie Tootie, she's my Friday gal."
3,Hank Williams,Honky Tonkin,TRUXOSF128F426D77C,1948,"When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.

When you and your baby have a fallin' out
Just call me up sweet mama and we'll go steppin' out
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
honky tonkin', Honey Baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.
We're goin' to the city - to the city fair

If you go to the city then you will find me there
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town.

When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
Call me up, sweet baby, and bring along some dough
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', Honey Baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town."
4,Hank Williams,My Sweet Love Ain't Around,TRLYGGS128F930DCEE,1948,"Written and recorded by Hank Wiliams Sr.

[C] Listen to ---the rain a-fallin'
Can't you hear ---that lonesome sound [C7]
Oh, my [F] poor ---old heart is [C] breakin'
'Cause my sweet ---love [G7] ain't a-[C] round.

Lord, I think ---I'll start to ramble
Got to leave ---this weary town
This old place ---is way too lonely
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

On that train ---tonight I'm leavin'
And don't ask me ---where I'm bound
I can't stay ---here any longer
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

(Two additional verses not on record)
Mem-o-ries ---come back to haunt me
My dream house ---has done fell down
This old world ---is dark around me
'Cause my sweet ---love ain't around.

Something tells ---me that I'm losing
'Cause these weary ---blues I've found
Oh, my bab- ---y left this morning
Lord, my sweet ---love ain't around."
5,Lonnie Johnson,Tomorrow Night,TRUBBVZ128F92CC061,1948,"Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrills be gone?

Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory?
Or just another lovely song thats in my heart to linger on?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And you willingly surrender, tell me darling, will it last?

Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight?

Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrills be gone?

Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory?
Or just another lovely song that's in my heart to linger on?

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And you willingly surrender, tell me darling, will it last?

Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight?"
6,Muddy Waters,Feel Like Going Home,TRXEOMV128EF34743A,1948,"Well, now it gettin,
Late on into the evenin and I feel like, like blowin my home.
When I woke up this mornin all I, I had was gone.
Now it gettin, Late on into the evenin, man now, I feel like, like blowin my home.
Well now, woke up this mornin, all I had was gone.

Well, brooks run into the ocean, the ocean run in, into the sea,
If I don't find my baby, somebody gonna sure bury me.
Brooks run into the ocean, man, that ole ocean run into the sea,
Well now, if I don't find my baby chile, somebody sure gonna bury me.

Well, minutes seemed like hours, an hour don't it seem like days?
Seems like my baby would stop her old evil way,
Minutes seemed like hours, an hour seemed like days,
Well now, seems like my baby child, whoo-hoo well, child,
Would stop her low down ways."
7,Peggy Lee,Don't Smoke In Bed,TRWMQGQ12903CBD07A,1948,"I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said

Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get a hand
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed

Don't look for me
I'll get a hand
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed"
8,Red Foley,Tennessee Saturday Night,TRZUKHM128F92FC6D6,1948,"Now, listen while I tell you about a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right
But they all go native on Saturday Night
Oh, well the music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples looking for romance
Somebody takes a brogan and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on Saturday night
When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellow packs a gun
Everybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on Saturday night.
Well, now you've heard my story about a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right
But they all go native on Saturday Night"
9,T. Texas Tyler,Deck Of Cards,TRZTXQP128F932E920,1948,"During the North African Campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike. They arrived in a little town called Casino. The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to church. A sergeant commanded the boys in church.
After the Chaplain read the prayer, the text was taken up next. Those of the boys that had a prayer book took them out. One boy had only a deck of cards, and he spread them out. The sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those cards."" After the service was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshal.
The Marshal said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man here?""
""For playing cards in church, Sir,"" was the response.
The Marshal asked the soldier, ""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""
""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier.
The Marshal stated, ""I hope so, for if not I will punish you more than any man was ever punished.""
The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six months. I have neither bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy you, sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy started his story...
""You see, sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there is but one God.
And the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts: the Old and the New Testaments.
When I see the trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
And when I see the four, I think of the four evangelists who preached the Gospel: there was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
And when I see the five, it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out.
When I see the six, it reminds me that in six days God made this heaven and earth.
And when I see the seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from his great work.
And when I see the eight, I think of the eight righteous persons that God saved when he destroyed the earth: there was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives.
And when I see the nine, I think of the lepers our saviour cleansed, and that nine of the ten didn't even thank him.
When I see the ten, I think of the ten commandments that God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone.
When I see the King, it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty.
And when I see the Queen, I think of the blessed Virgin Mary who is the Queen of Heaven.
And the Jack or Knave is the Devil.
When I count the number of spots in a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year.
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year.
There are four suits, the number of weeks in a month.
There are twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year.
There are thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.
So you see, Sir, my deck of cards serves me as a bible, an almanac and a prayer book.""
And friends, this story is true. I know... I was that soldier"
10,Wynonie Harris,Good Rockin' Tonight,TRQLGJF128F426C0E0,1948,"Well, I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can 
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

I said, meet me and a-hurry behind the barn 
Don't you be afraid 'cause I'll do you no harm 
I want you to bring along your rockin' shoes 
'Cause tonight we're gonna rock away all our blues 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

Well, we're gonna rock 
We're gonna rock 
Let's rock 
Come on and rock 
We're gonna rock all our blues away 

Have you heard the news: everybody's rockin' tonight 
Have you heard the news: everybody's rockin' tonight 
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can 
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock 
Come on and rock, rock, rock, rock 
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock 
Well, let's rock, rock, rock, rock 
We're gonna rock all our blues away"
