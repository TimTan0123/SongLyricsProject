But you can get 'em to the birds and bees
I need money (that's what I want)
That's what I want (that's what I want)

1,Big Bopper,Chantilly Lace,TRWFFRG128F92FE8F3,1959,"Hello baby, yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking
Oh you sweet thing
Do I what?
Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!

What's that baby?
But - but - but - oh honey!
But - oh baby you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk
Makes the world go round
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big eyed girl
That makes me act so funny
Make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose
Like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!

What's that honey?
Pick you up at eight
And don't be late?
But baby I ain't got no money, honey!
Oh, alright baby, you know what I like!

Chantilly lace
And a pretty face
And a pony tail hanging down
That wiggle in the walk
And giggle in the talk

Like a girl, oh baby that's what I like!"
2,Big Bopper,Little Red Riding Hood,TRQEVIS12903CF3552,1959,"Who's that I see walkin' in these woods?
Why it's Little Red Ridin' Hood
Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want
Listen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So, just to see that you don't get chased
I think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure, someone bad
So, untill you get to grandma's place
I think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on
Till I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone

Little Red Ridin' Hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't

What a big heart I have
The better to love you with
Little Red Ridin' Hood
Even bad wolves can be good
I'll try to keep satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place

Little Red Ridin' Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want

I mean... Baa... baa... baa"
3,Big Bopper,White Lightning,TRDSFJB128F92FE8F9,1959,"Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills,
Lived my pappy and he had him a still.
He brewed white lightning 'till the sun went down,
And then he'd fill him a jug, an' pass it around.
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, the G-men, T-men, revenurers too,
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew.
They were lookin', tryin' to book him,
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning

Well I asked my pappy why call it brew,
White lightning, 'stead of mountain dew.
I took on sip and then I knew,
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue.
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, G-men, T-men, revenuers too,
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew.
They were lookin', tryin' book him,
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning

Well, a city slicker came, and said ""I'm mighty tough.""
""I think I want to taste that powerful stuff.""
He took one s..slug and he drank it right down,
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, G-men, T-men, revenuers too,
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew.
They were lookin', tryin' book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning!"
4,Big Bopper,Strange Kisses,TROKIGN12903CF355E,1959,"I took a chance, went to the dance.
Just lookin', lookin' for someone new.
I thought you were home, knew I was wrong.
But I was feelin', feelin' so low and blue.
A few strange kisses, was all that I wanted, didn't think it hurt to fool you.
A few strange kisses was all that I wanted, I didn't want to lose you.

I left the dance with my new romance, but soon my little game was through.
I looked 'cross the floor, and through the door, I saw you lookin' for strange kisses too."
5,Billie Holiday,I Wished On the Moon,TRGYNZW128F92F9F4C,1959,"I wished on the moon
For something I never knew
Wished on the moon
For more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance by
I begged on the stars
To throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars
And asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness
It all came true
I wished on the moon for you"
6,Billie Holiday,Ain't Misbehavin',TRBKBDR128EF351693,1959,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's you I'm thinkin' of

7,Bing Crosby,Road To Morocco,TRQTNHQ128F930885D,1959,"We're off on the road to Morocco
This taxi is tough on the spine (hit me with a band-aid, Dad)
Where they're goin', why we're goin', how can we be sure
I'll lay you eight to five that we'll meet Dorothy Lamour (yeah, get in line)

Off on the road to Morocco
Hang on till the end of the line (I like your jockey. Quiet)
I hear this country's where they do the dance of the seven veils
We'd tell you more (uh-ah) but we would have the censor on our tails (good boy)

We certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound

We're off on the road to Morocco
Well look out, well clear the way, 'cause here we come
Stand by for a concussion
The men eat fire, sleep on nails and saw their wives in half
It seems to me there should be easier ways to get a laugh
(shall I slip on my big shoes?)

Off on the road to Morocco
Hooray! Well blow a horn, everybody duck
Yeah. it's a green light, come on boys

We run into Villians but we haven't any fears
Paramount will protect us cause we're signed for five more years(yeah)
Certainly do get around
Like Webster's Dictionary we're Morocco bound

We certainly do get around
Like a complete set of Shakespeare that you get
in the corner drugstore for a dollar ninety-eight
We're Morocco bound

Or, like a volume of Omar Khayyam that you buy in the
department store at Christmas time for your cousin Julia
We're Morocco bound
(we could be arrested)"
8,Blossom Dearie,Just In Time,TRHKTGD128F1498F55,1959,"Just in time
I found you just in time
Before you came, my time
Was running low.

I was lost
The losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed
Nowhere to go.

Now you're here
And now I know just where I'm going
No more doubts or fears
I've found my way.

For love came just in time
You found me just in time
And changed my lonely life
That lovely day!"
9,Blossom Dearie,Lucky To Be Me,TRZAARF128F1498F54,1959,"What a day,
Fortune smiled and came my way,
Bringing love I never thought I'd see,
I'm so lucky to be me.
What a night,
Suddenly you came in sight,
Looking just the way I'd hoped you'd be,
I'm so lucky to be me.
I am simply thunderstruck
At the change in my luck:
Knew at once I wanted you,
Never dreamed you'd want me, too.
I'm so proud
You chose me from all the crowd,
There's no other guy I'd rather be,
I could laugh out loud,
I'm so lucky to be me."
10,Blossom Dearie,Lonely Town,TRLOILA128F1498F5D,1959,"A town's a lonely town,
When you pass through
And there is no one waiting there for you,
Then it's a lonely town.
You wander up and down,
The crowds rush by,
A million faces pass before your eye,
Still it's a lonely town.

Unless there's love,
A love that's shining like a harbor light,
You're lost in the night;
Unless there's love,
The world's an empty place
And every town's a lonely town."
11,Blossom Dearie,It's Love,TRXODBR128F1498F5B,1959,"It's love, it's love
Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it
What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

It's love at last I have someone to cheer for
It's love at last I've learned what I'm here for
I've heard it said, ""You know it when you see it""
Well, I see it and I know it, it's love

It's love, it's love
Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it
What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

It's love at last I have someone to cheer for
It's love at last I've learned what we're here for
I've heard it said, ""You know it when you see it""
Well, I see it and I know it, it's love"
12,Bo Diddley,Say Man,TRQVSQW128F93010D4,1959,"Say man,
What's that boy?
I want to tell you 'bout your girlfriend,
What about my girl?
Well, you don't look strong enough to take the message,
I'm strong enough,
I might hurt your feelings,
My feelings are already hurt by being here with you,
Well, I was walking down the street with your girl the other day,
Ah-ha,
And the wind was blowin' real hard,
Is that right?
And the wind blew her hair into my face,
Ah-ha,
You know what else happened?
What happened?
The wind blew her hair into her face,
Yeh?
And we went a little further; you wanna hear the rest of it?
I might as well,
The wind blew her hair into the street!
Ok; since you told me about my girl, I'm gonna tell you about yours. I was walking down the street with your girl,
Yes?
I took her home, for a drink, you know,
Took her home?
Yeh, jus' for a drink,
Oh,
But that chick looked so ugly, she had to sneak up on the glass to get a drink of water!
You've got the nerve to call somebody ugly; why you so ugly the stork that brought you in the world oughta be arrested!
That's alright; my momma didn't have to put a sheet on my head so sleep could slip up on me!
Look-a here!
What's that?
Where are you from?
South America,
What's that?
South America,
You don't look like no South American to me,
I'm still from South America,
What part?
South Texas!
Where are your workin' boots at?
I've got 'em on,
Those aren't no boots you got on; those broguettes!
Hey, look-a here!
What's that?
I've bin tryin' to figure out what you is,
I already figured out what YOU is!
What's that?
You that thing I throw peanuts at!
Look-a here!
What's that?
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Why?
Calling people ugly,
I didn't call you ugly,
What you say?
I said you was ruined, that's all!
You know somethin'?
What?
You look like you've bin whooped with a ugly-stick!
Hey! I ain't got nothin' to do with it, but I beat the fellah right...!"
13,Bo Diddley,Crackin' Up,TRVYANY12903CA9D9F,1959,"You're always hollerin' bout where I've been
You're always screamin' bout the money I spend
What's wrong with you, oh yeah
You're crackin up

I caught you, woman, a long time ago
Keep your hand out of my pocket keep your foot out my
Door
That wrong with you, oh yeah,
You're crackin up

I used to do your cookin', your laundry too
Now what more for a woman could a man like me do
I feel, oh yeah
You're bugging me

Crackin' up"
14,Bobby Darin,Beyond the Sea,TRWCRZP128F931A35F,1959,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waitin' for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailin'

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watchin' for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms, I'd go sailin'

It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'

I know beyond a doubt, ah!
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailin'

No more sailin'
So long, sailin'
Bye bye, sailin'
Move on out, captain"
15,Bobby Darin,Dream Lover,TRRXMOY12903CB89CE,1959,"Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you
With a love oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some-way I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until all my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until all my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No I don't want to dream alone....."
16,Bobby Darin,Mack the Knife,TRBBDYD12903CE4DF7,1959,"Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it out of sight

You know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears old Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, ooh, sunny morning, uh-huh
Lies a body just oozin' life
Eek, and someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't ya know
Where a cement bag's just a-droopin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, old Macky's back in town

Now d'ya hear about Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done something rash? 

Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry    
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town

I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town

Look out ol' Macky's back"

18,Bobby Darin,That's The Way Love Is,TRXKQPO12903CD7611,1959,"You're feeling low and oh so small 
Then suddenly you're eight feet tall 
She just walked in the room 
And the gloomy room just glows 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

You're such a drag from nine 'til five 
Then all at once you're so alive 
It's just the way she winks her eye 
Or wrinkles her nose 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

It's the world's oldest unsolved riddle 
The kind of game you just can't win 
And if you come up with the answer 
You're a better man sir, than I, Gunga Din

So when that tingle hits you deep 
And you're tired but you just can't sleep 
Don't you take my word 
Go and ask anyone who knows 
That's the way love is 
That's how it goes

It's the world's oldest unsolved riddle 
The kind of game you just can't win

You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darling, you're going to need me again
It's just a matter of time

Go on, go on
Until you reach the end of the line
But I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down

I know, I know
That one day, you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time"

I don't say
That it's true

Do you recall a girl that's been in nearly every song
This is what I heard
Of course, the story could be wrong

She's the one
I've been told
Now she's wearing a band of gold
Peggy Sue got married not long ago

Well, whoopsie daisy, how you drove me crazy

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins witching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the sky
It's that old devil moon deep in your eyes

You and your glance makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazin' their light can't hold a candle
To your razzle dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
I wanna cry
Wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon deep in your eyes

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love!!

All dressed up like a downtown christmas tree
Dancin' and hummin' a rock-roll melody

She's the daughter of a well-respected man
Who taught her how to judge and understand
Since she became a rock-roll music fan

Sweet little rock and roller, sweet little rock and roller
Her daddy don't have to scold her, her mother can't hardly hold her
She never gets any older, sweet little rock and roller

Should've seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled ""hooray!""

Ten thousand eyes were watching them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues were screaming ""more! more!""
About 1500 waitin' outside the door

Sweet little rock and roller"

She's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen 
Meanwhile I was thinkin'
She's in the mood
No need to break it
I got a chance, I oughta take it

We'll admit it
If it's a rocker, then we'll get it

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world

She's got to talk about romance

Dealing out the cards from left to right
And the queen of hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone just playing solitaire

Love was just another game for two
I see now that's all it meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance
The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
Cuz I played my hand so carelessly
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire

And until you want to share that old feeling

I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat off with my gloves
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire and the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm

When a cute little gal just looks at me with a gleam in her eye
And I say ""Baby, you better not do that"", and she say ""Oh, why?""
And I say ""Because you just better not do that""

When I went to the country school I always had a girl
They'd laugh and giggle awful cute and put me in a whirl
And everyday at recess time they followed me outside
I'd scratch my head and wonder are they ever satisfied
I'd say ""Baby, you better not do that"" and she'd say ""Why?""
And I'd say ""Because you just better not do that""

I got a little older, and I went to the country dance
I went to have a little fun, I wasn't thinkin' about romance
But the dim lights just lured 'em on and they'd snuggle up to me
I knew I couldn't last too long, 'cos I'm human you see

Since we've been apart
I don't know, I don't know honey

Over you

When nighttime starts
Like daytime breaks
I get the blues honey and I'll tell you what it takes
When the one you love
Ain't with you no more
You go to pieces baby and there's just just no cure

For the blues
Oh yeah the blues
I got the blues

Well, one more time baby
Oh, just the hope (?) 
One more time
And I won't have her anymore

One more kiss honey

My poor mind cannot grasp their array

Had a plan when he placed them that way
Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds but I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to him

In this world of fear and doubt on my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely heavy cross I must bear
Then he tells me in my prayer it's because I am trust worthy
He gives me strenght far more than my share
Known only to him..."

My God is real, he's real in my soul, my God is real for he has washed and he made me whole, his love for me is like pure gold.  My God is real for I can feel him in my soul.

I cannot tell just how it felt when Jesus washed my sins away, but since that day yes since that hour, God has been real for I can feel his mighty power.

My God is real, he's real in my soul, my God is real for he has washed and made my whole, his love for me, is like pure gold.  My God is real for I can feel him in my soul."

Comme quoi l'existence
Ça vous donne toutes les chances
Pour les reprendre après...

Unattainable

The world is my oyster no more
All the papers
Where I lead the news
With my capers
Now will spread the news
Superman
Turns out to be flash-in-the-pan
I've been around the world in a plane
Designed the latest IBM brain
But lately
I'm so downhearted
'Cause I can't get started with you
In Cincinatti
Or in Rangoon
I simply smile
And all the gals swoon
Their whims
I've more than just charted
But I can't get started with you
O tell me why
Am I no kick to you
I who'd always stick to you
Fly through thin and thick to you
Tell me why I'm taboo
Each time I chanced
To see Franklin D.
He always said
Hi buddy to me
And with queens
I've a la carted
But I can't get started
With you"

Here's that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny
That rainy day is here
It's funny
How love becomes
A cold rainy day

If you turn me down once more, I'll join the French Foreign Legion
Bet you, they would welcome me, with open arms

First you love me, yes; then you love me, no
I don't know where I stand
Do we march together down the isle
Or do I march that desert sand

If you think I won't find romance, in the French Foreign Legion
Think about that uniform with all its charm
Just one more time are you gonna be mine, or au revoir cheri
It's the French Foreign Legion for me"

Ain't gonna miss a thing, 
I'm gonna have my fling,

Could come from someone new, when no one cares but you"

I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else

O what a distance dear to one
Who loves me

From joy and gladness
My senses fail
A burning fire
Devours me
None but the lonely heart
Can know my sadness"

Many times I've been here and many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love

Night after night I've been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till cold grey dawn
Hoping that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Trying hard to find you, somewhere here above
High on a mountain of love

The mountain of love, the mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you sure changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a great tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, here up above
High on a mountain of love

You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love

La mort m'attend aux dernières feuilles
De l'arbre qui fera mon cercueil
Pour mieux clouer le temps qui passe
La mort m'attend dans les lilas
Qu'un fossoyeur lancera sur moi
Pour mieux fleurir le temps qui passe
La mort m'attend dans un grand lit
Tendu aux toiles de l'oubli
Pour mieux fermer le temps qui passe

Mais qu'y a-t-il derrière la porte
Et qui m'attend déjà
Ange ou démon qu'importe
Au devant de la porte il y a toi"
80,Jim Reeves,He'll Have To Go,TROSIXU128F4295024,1959,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend we're together all alone
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he  holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go

You cant say the words I want to hear
While  you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no
Darling I will understand

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Lets pretend that we're together all alone

Que isto é bossa nova, que isto é muito natural

O que você não sabe, nem sequer pressente
É que os desafinados também tem um coração
Fotografei você na minha Rolleiflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão

Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross and put thorns on his head 
Who was it everybody... 
Well they took him down and they buried him and after the third day 
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone

How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
Oh my grades are low on my card I know but they oughta give me one above
If I made a mark for learnin' in the dark I'd have straight A's in love

Now in my senior year with graduation near I did my home work every night
And when my mama said I oughta go to bed I'd turn out all the lights
But my sweetic pie was waitin' right outside she'd be a cooin' like a dove
Though I did my beat I made some mess o'test but I made straight A's in love

Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
'Til the great tribulation is o'er

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird"

And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind

Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
See what a year can bring

I sit alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone, he doesn't write
He says he is busy and I say busy
He's making whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per

Says, ""You pay six to her""

In the middle of a sweet embrace,

Remember how surprised we were
To find we really meant it!

We stumbled into paradise;
In the twinkle of an eye
We lost it again,
For we didn't comprehend
That our dream of love would end,
Just the way it began,

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

(chorus)
Sometimes i wonder why i spend the lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie.
And i am once again with you
When our love was new.
And each kiss, an inspiration.

But that was long ago.
And now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.

Beside a garden wall where stars are bright
You are in my arms.
A nightingale sings its fairy tale
Of paradise where roses bloom.

Though i dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
That stardust melody
The memory of love's.
The memory of love's
The memory of love's refrain"

116,Marty Robbins,The Master's Call,TRCAGIN128F426E8BB,1959,"When I was but a young man I was wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens, but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
I know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad.

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful living leads only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my Master call.

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
But a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, I thought I heard a shout.

Then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
And this time I knew I heard a voice, a voice so sweet and strange
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name.

So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle they stampeded, were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground.

I felt the end was near, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
And I cried oh Lord forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for you alone, Oh God these words I vow.

My wicked past unfolded, I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life is his to take or give.

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground.

A pardon I was granted, my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Saviour called my name..."

That rythes in the treetops,

Come back, come back,

Come back to this poor cowboy's arms

118,Marty Robbins,Big Iron,TRNZYCE128F4269B49,1959,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron Big iron

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip"
119,Marty Robbins,El Paso,TRSZQSN128F42664A8,1959,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Faleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Faleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Faleena, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Faleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Faleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Faleena, goodbye"

Whisper to the wind to say that love has sinned
To leave my heart aching and making this moan,
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light,
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone,
Weeping willow tree, weep in sympathy,
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me,
When the shadows fall, bend oh willow and weep for me.

I don't want him you can have him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him you can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I'm afraid I never loved him
Sweetie he'd be better off with you
I could never make him happy

All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had a little too much

Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him cos I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him cos I don't want him because he's not my man

That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And if everything goes right
To the church we'll go to marry

He'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I will meet him Sunday 
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still, I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

148,Shirley Bassey,Night and Day,TRWMCJW12903CCB499,1959,"I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly reknown
She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high
Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
We weren't searchin' for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Livin' by the sword
And we steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, to the alley or the trusty woods
I used her, she used me
But neither one cared
We were gettin' our share
Workin' on our night moves
Tryin' to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime

And oh the wonder
We felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in"

Don't say it all depends
Who wants to help me burn my candle, at both ends

Who's got a light he's hidin', under a bush or fence
Who wants to help me burn my candle, at both ends

It's possible, it may not last a night
While it burns, what a wonderful light

Who'd like to play with fire
After they make ammends
Who wants to help me burn my candle, at both ends

Who doesn't mind a reaper, after he's sewn wild oats
Who wants to take a chance and help me, burn my boats

Who's not a look, then leaper
Wanting a warning note
Who wants to take a chance and help me, burn my boats

There's 'S' for Scotch, that's so direct
And for straight and simple sex
""I"" for invitation to, a close relationship with you
""N"" for nothing bad nor less
""S-I-N"", that's sin, I guess

Who's got a good ignition
Waiting for dividends
Who wants to help me burn my candle, at both ends

It may not last, but it's all in the game, my friend
And while it burns, what a fabulous flame

Who has an inhibition
Who has a notch, that's on the handle
Open my door, and spun the scandal
Who wants to help me burn my candle, at both ends!"

165,Tom Lehrer,It Makes A Fellow Proud To Be A Soldier,TRMFLMC128F145E3FE,1959,"Spoken introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
I have only comparatively recently emerged from the 
United States Army, so that I am now, of course, in 
The radioactive reserve. And, the usual jokes about 
The Army aside, one of the many fine things one has 
#to admit is the way that the Army has carried the 
American democratic ideal to its logical conclusion, 
In the sense that not only do they prohibit discrimination 
On the grounds of race, creed, and color, but also on 
The grounds of ability.
Be that as it may, some of you may recall the publicity 
A few years ago attendant upon the Army's search for an 
Official Army song to be the counterpart of the Navy's 
""Anchors Aweigh"" and the Air Force's ""Up In The Air, 
Junior Birdman"" and so on. I was in basic training at 
The time, and I recall our platoon sergeant, who was 
An unfrocked Marine. (Actually, the change of service 
Had come as quite a blow to him because it meant that 
He had to memorize a new serial number which took up 
Most of his time.)
At any rate, I recall this sergeant's informing me and 
My ""roommates"" of this rather deplorable fact that the 
Army didn't have any official...excuse me, didn't have 
No official song and suggested that we work on this in 
Our copious free time. Well, I submitted the following 
Song, which is called ""It Makes A Fellow Proud To Be A 
Soldier"" which, I think, demonstrates the proper spirit, 
You'll agree. However, the fact that it did not win the 
Contest I can ascribe only to blatant favoritism on part 
Of the judges. 

The heart of every man in our platoon must swell with pride
For the nation's youth, the cream of which is marching at his side
For the fascinating rules and regulations that we share
And the quaint and curious costumes that we're called upon to wear
Now Al joined up to do his part defending you and me
He wants to fight and bleed and kill and die for liberty
With the hell of war he's come to grips
Policing up the filter tips
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier!

When Pete was only in the seventh grade, he stabbed a cop
He's real R.A. material, and he was glad to swap
His switchblade and his old zip gun
For a bayonet and a new M-1
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier!

After Johnny got through basic training, he
Was a soldier through and through when he was done
Its effects were so well rooted
That the next day he saluted
A Good Humor man, an usher, and a nun

Now, Fred's an intellectual, brings a book to every meal
He likes the deep philosophers, like Norman Vincent Peale
He thinks the army's just the thing
Because he finds it broadening
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier!

Now, Ed flunked out of second grade, and never finished school
He doesn't know a shelter half from an entrenching tool
But, he's going to be a big success
He heads his class at OCS
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier!

Our old mess sergeant's taste buds had been shot off in the war
But his savory collations add to our esprit de corps
To think of all the marvelous ways
They're using plastics nowadays
It makes a fellow proud to be a soldier!

Our lieutenant is the up-and-coming type
Played with soldiers as a boy, you just can bet
It is written in the stars
He will get his captain's bars
But he hasn't got enough box tops yet

Our captain has a handicap to cope with, sad to tell
He's from Georgia, and he doesn't speak the language very well
He used to be, so rumor has
The Dean of Men... at Alcatraz
It makes a fellow proud to be
What as a kid I vowed to be
What luck to be allowed to be a soldier
(At ease!)"
166,Tom Lehrer,Oedipus Rex,TRMDKXP128F145E3FB,1959,"Spoken live introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
And now, may I have the next slide please?
...carried away there. 
It seems that most of the songs that you hear these days 
On the radio played by the disk jockeys, apart from rock 
And roll and other children's records, tend to be motion 
Picture title songs. Apparently producers feel that we 
Will not attend their movies unless we have the titles 
Well drilled into our heads in advance. Of course, we 
Don't go anyway, but at least this way they make back on 
The song some of what they've lost on the picture. But, 
With the rise of the motion picture title song we have 
Such hits of the past few years as ""The Ten Commandments Mambo"", 
""Brothers Karamazov Cha-Cha"", ""Incredible Shrinking Man I Love You""
...I'm sure you're all familiar with these.
But, a few years ago, a motion picture version appeared 
Of Sophocles' immortal tragedy ""Oedipus Rex"". This picture 
Played only in the so-called art theaters, and it was not 
A financial success. And I maintain that the reason it was 
Not a financial success... you're way ahead of me... was 
That it did not have a title tune which the people could 
Hum, and which would make them actually eager to attend 
This particular flick. So, I've attempted to supply this, 
And here then is the prospective title song from ""Oedipus Rex"": 

From the Bible to the popular song
There's one theme that we find right along
Of all ideals they hail as good
The most sublime is motherhood

There was a man though, who it seems
Once carried this ideal to extremes
He loved his mother and she loved him
And yet his story is rather grim

There once lived a man named Oedipus Rex
You may have heard about his odd complex
His name appears in Freud's index
'Cause he loved his mother

His rivals used to say quite a bit
That as a monarch he was most unfit
But still in all they had to admit
That he loved his mother

Yes, he loved his mother like no other
His daughter was his sister and his son was his brother
One thing on which you can depend is,
He sure knew who a boy's best friend is

When he found what he had done
He tore his eyes out, one by one
A tragic end to a loyal son
Who loved his mother

So be sweet and kind to mother
Now and then have a chat
Buy her candy or some flowers
Or a brand new hat
But maybe you had better let it go at that

Or you may find yourself with a quite complex complex
And you may end up like Oedipus
I'd rather marry a duck-billed platypus
Than end up like old Oedipus Rex"
167,Tom Lehrer,We Will All Go Together When We Go,TRGPSSQ12903CF4D63,1959,"Spoken:
I am reminded at this point of a fellow I used to know
Whose name was Henry, only to give you an idea of what
A individualist he was, he spelled it H-E-N-3-R-Y -
The three was silent, you see
Henry was financially independent, having inherited his
Father's tar-and-feather business, and was therefore
Able to devote his full time to such intellectual pursuits
As writing. I particularly remember a heartwarming novel
Of his about a young necrophiliac who finally achieved his
Boyhood ambition by becoming coroner... (The rest of you
Can look it up when you get home.)
In addition to writing, he indulged in a good deal of
Philosophizing. Like so many contemporary philosophers, he
Especially enjoyed giving helpful advice to people who were
Happier than he was. And one particular bit of advice which
I recall - which is the reason I bring up this whole dreary
Story - is something he said once, before they took him away
To the ""Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered""
He said: ""Life is like a sewer - what you get out of it depends
On what you put into it."" It's always seemed to me that this
Is precisely the sort of dynamic, positive thinking that we so
Desperately need today in these trying times of crisis and
Universal brouhaha. And so with this in mind, I have here a
Modern, positive, dynamic, uplifting song, in the tradition
Of the great old revival hymns. This one might more accurately
Be termed a survival hymn. It goes like this

Sung:
When you attend a funeral
It is sad to think that sooner o'
Later those you love will do the same for you
And you may have thought it tragic
Not to mention other adjec-
Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do
(But don't you worry.)
No more ashes, no more sackcloth
And an armband made of black cloth
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve
For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we go
What a comforting fact that is to know
Universal bereavement
An inspiring achievement
Yes, we all will go together when we go

We will all go together when we go
All suffuse with an incandescent glow
No one will have the endurance
To collect on his insurance
Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go

Oh we will all fry together when we fry
We'll be french fried potatoes by and by
There will be no more misery
When the world is our rotisserie
Yes, we will all fry together when we fry

Down by the old maelstrom
There'll be a storm before the calm

And we will all bake together when we bake
There'll be nobody present at the wake
With complete participation
In that grand incineration
Nearly three billion hunks of well-done steak

Oh we will all char together when we char
And let there be no moaning of the bar
Just sing out a Te Deum
When you see that I.C.B.M
And the party will be ""come-as-you-are.""

Oh we will all burn together when we burn
There'll be no need to stand and wait your turn
When it's time for the fallout
And Saint Peter calls us all out
We'll just drop our agendas and adjourn

You will all go directly to your respective Valhallas
Go directly, do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred dolla's

And we will all go together when we go
Ev'ry Hottenhot an' ev'ry Eskimo
When the air becomes uranious
And we will all go simultaneous
Yes we all will go together
When we all go together
Yes, we all will go together when we go"
168,Tom Lehrer,Poisoning Pigeons In The Park,TRHHBGA128F145E3F7,1959,"Spoken introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
I'd like to take you now on wings of song as it were, 
And try and help you forget, perhaps, for a while, 
Your drab wretched lives.
Here is a song all about springtime in general, 
And in particular about one of the many delightful 
Pastimes that the coming of spring affords us all: 

Spring is here
A-suh-puh-ring is here
Life is skittles and life is beer
I think the loveliest time 
Of the year is the spring
I do, don't you? 'Course you do
But there's one thing 
That makes spring complete for me
And makes every Sunday 
A treat for me 

All the world seems in tune
On a spring afternoon
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park
Every Sunday you'll see
My sweetheart and me
As we poison the pigeons in the park

When they see us coming
The birdies all try an' hide
But they still go for peanuts 
When coated with cyanide
The sun's shining bright
Everything seems all right
When we're poisoning pigeons in the park

We've gained notoriety
And caused much anxiety
In the Audubon Society
With our games
They call it impiety
And lack of propriety
And quite a variety
Of unpleasant names
But it's not against any religion
To want to dispose of a pigeon

So if Sunday you're free
Why don't you come with me
And we'll poison the pigeons in the park
And maybe we'll do
In a squirrel or two
While we're poisoning pigeons in the park

We'll murder them all 
Amid laughter and merriment
Except for the few 
We take home to experiment
My pulse will be quickenin'
With each drop of strych'nine
We feed to a pigeon
(It just takes a smidgin!)
To poison a pigeon in the park"
169,Tom Lehrer,Clementine,TRHOMMT12903CB718A,1959,"Spoken introduction:
I should like to consider the folk song, 
And expound briefly on a theory I have held 
For some time, to the effect that the reason 
Most folk songs are so atrocious is that they 
Were written by the people. 
If professional songwriters had written them 
Instead, things might have turned out considerably 
Differently. For example, consider the old favorite, 
With which, I'm sure, you're all familiar, 
""Clementine"", you know: 

In a cavern, in a canyon
Dadada dadadada . . . 

...a song with no recognizable merit whatsoever – 
And imagine what might have happened if, for example, 
Cole Porter had tried writing this song. The first 
Verse might have come out like this: 

(Cole Porter Style)
In a cavern . . .
In a canyon . . .
Excava-hay-hay-hehting for . . .
A mine
Far away from the BOOM-BOOM-BOOM . . .
Of the city –
She was so pretty
What a pity – Clementine!
Oh, Clementine . . .
Can't you tell from the howls of me . . .
This love of mine
Calls to you from the bowels of me . . .
Are, you, dis-CERning
The reTURning
Of this CHURning
BURning . . .
YEARning for you . . . 
And –

(spoken) Well, supposing at this point, that Mozart... 
Or, one of that crowd... had tried writing a verse, 
The next one might've come out as a baritone-aria 
From an Italian opera - somewhat along these lines:

Era legera e come un fairy  
{It was light and (she was) like a fairy}
E suo shoes numero nine
{And her shoes (were) number nine}
Herring bo-ho-ho-hoxes sans-a to-ho-ho-hopses, 
{Herring bo-ho-ho-hoxes without to-ho-ho-hopses}
Sandalae per Clementina si
{Sandals for Clementine}
Per Clementina si
{For Clementine}
Per Clementina sandalae
{Sandals for Clementine}
Per Clementina sandalae 
{Sandals for Clementine}
Per Clementina!
{For Clementine}

Clementina, Clementina, Cleh-eh-eh-ehmentina . . . 
{Clementine x3}
Herring boxes sans-a topses sandalae per Clementina
{Herring boxes without topses, sandals for Clementine}
Herring boxes sans-a topses sandalae per Clementina
{Herring boxes without topses, sandals for Clementine}
Che sciagura Clementina
{What a disaster, Clementine}
Che sciagura Clementina
{What a disaster, Clementine}
Cara Clementina
{Beloved Clementine}
Cara Clementina-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!
{Beloved Clementine}

(spoken) Supposing, at this rather dramatic juncture in 
The narrative, one ofour modern ""cool school"" of composers 
Had tried writing a verse, thenext one might've come out... 
A-like this...

(whispered) A-one, A-two, A-three!
Drove those ducklings to the water, yprach!
Doodilehdoodoot, yah-hah . . .
Every mornin', like nine a.m., awhoopah
Doodileh doo-doo, doodilidah
Got a-hung upon a splinter
Got a-hung upon a splinter, klooglimah!
Hoo, hoot!
Fell into the foamy brine –
Dig that crazy Clementine, man!

(spoken) To end on a happy note, one can always count 
On Gilbert and Sullivan for a rousig finale – full of words 
And music, and signifying... nothing!

That I missed her depressed her 
Young sister named Esther
This mister to pester the tried –
Now a pestering sister's a festering blister
You're best to resist her, say I!

The mister resisted
The sister persisted
When I kissed her, all loyalty slipped
When she said I could have her
Her sister's cadaver
Must surely have turned in its crypt!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

But I love she, and she loves me
And raptured are the both of we
Yes, I love she and she loves I . . .
And will through all eterni-ty!

– See what I mean?"
170,Tom Lehrer,She's My Girl,TRCQKMG12903CB7192,1959,"Spoken introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
And now to the love song...
I'm sure you're familiar with love songs on the order of 
""He's just my Bill"", ""... my man"", ""... my Joe"", ""... my Max"", 
And so on, where the girl who sings them tells you that, 
Although the man she loves is antisocial, alcoholic, physically 
Repulsive, or just plain unsanitary, that, nevertheless, she is 
His because he is hers, and like that.
But, as far as I know, there has never been a popular song from 
The analogous male point of view, that is to say, of a man who 
Finds himself in love with, or, in this case, married to, a girl, 
Who has nothing whatsoever to recommend her. I have attempted to 
Fill this need. The song is called ""She's My Girl"". 

Sharks gotta swim, and bats gotta fly
I gotta love one woman till I die
To Ed or Dick or Bob
She may be just a slob
But to me, well
She's my girl

In winter, the bedroom is one large ice cube
And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube!
Her hairs in the sink
Have driven me to drink
But she's my girl, she's my girl, she's my girl
And I love her

The girl that I lament for
The girl my money's spent for
The girl my back is bent for
The girl I owe the rent for
The girl I gave up Lent for
Is the girl that heaven meant for me

So though for breakfast she makes coffee that tastes like sham – poo
I come home for dinner and get peanut butter stew
Or, if I'm in luck
It's broiled hockey puck
But, oh well, what the hell
She's my girl
And I love her"
171,Tom Lehrer,A Christmas Carol,TRRGQZA128F9307493,1959,"Spoken live introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol. 
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time. 
However, I'm informed by my disk jockey friends – of whom 
I have none – that in order to get a song popular by Christmas 
Time, you have to start plugging it well in advance. So here 
Goes. 
It has always seemed to me after all, that Christmas, 
With its spirit of giving, offers us all a wonderful opportunity 
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply 
Believe in – I refer of course, to money. And yet none of the 
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street, 
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we 
Celebrate it in the United States, that is to say the commercial 
Spirit. So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol 
For next year, as being perhaps a bit more appropriate.

Christmas time is here, by golly
Disapproval would be folly
Deck the halls with hunks of holly
Fill the cup and don't say when 

Kill the turkeys, ducks and chickens
Mix the punch, drag out the Dickens
Even though the prospect sickens
Brother, here we go again

On Christmas Day you can't get sore
Your fellow man you must adore
There's time to rob him all the more
The other three hundred and sixty-four

Relations, sparing no expense, 'll
Send some useless old utensil
Or a matching pen and pencil
(""Just the thing I need, how nice!"") 

It doesn't matter how sincere it is
Nor how heart felt the spirit
Sentiment will not endear it
What's important is the price

Hark, the Herald Tribune sings
Advertising wondrous things
God rest ye merry merchants
May ye make the Yuletide pay
Angels we have heard on high
Tell us to go out and – buy! 

So let the raucous sleighbells jingle
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle
Driving his reindeer across the sky
Don't stand underneath when they fly by

(spoken)
Actually I did rather well myself, this last Christmas. 
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate 
""Good at any hospital for a lobotomy""... rather thoughtful."
172,Tom Lehrer,The Masochism Tango,TRPTZKG128F9307494,1959,"Spoken introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
Another familiar type of love song is the passionate or 
Fiery variety, usually in tango tempo, in which the singer 
Exhorts his partner to haunt him and taunt him and, if at 
All possible, to consume him with a kiss of fire. This 
Particular illustration of this genre is called 
""The Masochism Tango"". 

I ache for the touch of your lips, dear
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
You can raise welts
Like nobody else
As we dance to the Masochism Tango

Let our love be a flame, not an ember
Say it's me that you want to dismember
Blacken my eye
Set fire to my tie
As we dance to the Masochism Tango

At your command
Before you here I stand
My heart is in my hand . . .
(Yeechh!)
It's here that I must be

My heart entreats
Just hear those savage beats
And go put on your cleats
And come and trample me

Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
My soul is on fire
It's aflame with desire
Which is why I perspire when we tango 

You caught my nose
In your left castanet, love
I can feel the pain yet, love
Ev'ry time I hear drums

And I envy the rose
That you held in your teeth, love
With the thorns underneath, love
Sticking into your gums

Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
The last time I needed twenty stitches
To sew up the gash
You made with your lash
As we danced to the Masochism Tango

Bash in my brain
And make me scream with pain
Then kick me once again
And say we'll never part

I know too well
I'm underneath your spell
So, darling, if you smell
Something burning, it's my heart . . . (hiccup)
'Scuse me! 

Take your cigarette from its holder
And burn your initials in my shoulder
Fracture my spine
And swear that you're mine
As we dance to the Masochism Tango"
173,Tom Lehrer,Bright College Days,TRTVGKV128F145E3F8,1959,"Spoken live introduction on An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer:
(Applause)
Thank you! 
For my first encore I'd like to turn to a type of 
Song... to a type of song that people like myself find ourselves subjected 
To with increasing frequency as time goes on, and that is 
The college ""alma mater"". You'll find yourself at a reunion 
Of grads, and old undergrads, and eh... somebody will start 
Croaking out one of these things and everyone will gradually 
Join in. Each in his own key, of course, until the place is 
Just soggy with nostalgia. 
Well, a typical such song might be called ""Bright College Days"", 
And might go like this: 

Bright college days, oh, carefree days that fly
To thee we sing with our glasses raised on high  (holds up eyeglasses) 
Let's drink a toast as each of us recalls
Ivy-covered professors in ivy-covered halls

Turn on the spigot
Pour the beer and swig it
And gaudeamus igit-ur

Here's to parties we tossed
To the games that we lost
(We shall claim that we won them some day)

To the girls young and sweet
To the spacious back seat
Of our roommate's beat up Chevrolet

To the beer and benzedrine
To the way that the dean
Tried so hard to be pals with us all

To excuses we fibbed
To the papers we cribbed
From the genius who lived down the hall

To the tables down at Morey's 
(Wherever that may be)
Let us drink a toast to all we love the best
We will sleep through all the lectures
And cheat on the exams
And we'll pass, and be forgotten with the rest

Oh, soon we'll be out amid the cold world's strife
Soon we'll be sliding down the razor blade of life
(Laughter)
(spoken)  Ready? 
(Laughter)

But as we go our sordid sep'rate ways
We shall ne'er forget thee, thou golden college days

Hearts full of youth
Hearts full of truth
Six parts gin to one part vermouth"
174,Tom Lehrer,In Old Mexico,TRLDXSZ12903CB7181,1959,"Spoken introduction on An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer:
The outpatients are out in force tonight, I see, good! Now... 
I'm sure you're all aware that this week is National Gall 
Bladder Week,and so as sort of an educational feature at 
This point I thought I would acquaint you with some of the 
Results of my recent researches into the career of the late 
Doctor Samuel Gall, inventor of the gall bladder, which 
Certainly ranks as one of the more important technological 
Advances since the invention of the joy buzzer and the dribble 
Glass.
Dr. Gall's faith in his invention was so dramatically vindicated 
Last year, as you no doubt recall, when, for the first time 
In history in a nationwide poll, the gall bladder was voted 
Among the top ten organs.
His educational career began, interestingly enough, in 
Agricultural school, where he majored in animal husbandry, 
Until they...caught him at it one day... whereupon he switched 
To the field of medicine, in which field he also won renown as 
The inventor of gargling, which prior to that time had been 
Practiced only furtively by a remote tribe in the Andes who 
Passed the secret down from father to son as part of their 
Oral tradition.
He soon became a specialist, specializing in diseases of the 
Rich. He was therefore able to retire at an early age...
To the land we all dream about: sunny Mexico, of course, 
The last part of which is completely irrelevant, as was the 
Whole thing, I guess, except it's a rather sneaky way of 
Getting into this next type of popular song, which is one 
Of those things about that magic and romantic land south of 
The border.

When it's fiesta time in Guadalajara
Then I long to be back once again
In Old Mexico
Where we lived for today, never giving a thought to tomara
To the strumming of guitars
In a hundred grubby bars
I would whisper: ""Te amo!""

The mariachis would serenade
And they would not shut up till they were paid
We ate, we drank, and we were merry
And we got typhoid and dysentery

But best of all, we went to the Plaza de Toros
Now whenever I start feeling morose
I revive by recalling that scene
And names like Belmonte, Domingu'in, and Manolete
If I live to a hundred and eighty
I shall never forget what they mean

Spoken:
For there is surely nothing more beautiful in this 
World than the sight of a lone man facing single-handedly 
A half a ton of angry pot roast!

Out came the matador
Who must have been potted or
Slightly insane, but who looked rather bored
Then the picadors of course
Each one on his horse
I shouted ""Olé!"" ev'ry time one was gored

I cheered at the banderilleros' display
As they stuck the bull in their own clever way
For I hadn't had so much fun since the day
My brother's dog Rover
Got run over

Spoken:
Rover was killed by a Pontiac. And it was done 
With such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the 
Driver both ears and the tail – but I digress . . .

The moment had come
I swallowed my gum
We knew there'd be blood on the sand pretty soon
The crowd held its breath
Hoping that death
Would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon

At last, the matador did what we wanted him to
He raised his sword and his aim was true
In that moment of truth, I suddenly knew
That someone had stolen my wallet

Now it's fiesta time in Akron, Ohio
But it's back to old Guadalajara I'm longing to go
Far away from the strikes of the A.F. of L. and C.I.O.
How I wish I could get back
To the land of the wetback
And forget the Alamo
In Old Mexico
Olé!"
175,Tom Lehrer,The Elements,TRSVRKN128F9307491,1959,"Spoken live introduction on 'An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer:'
Now, if I may digress momentarily from the mainstream of this evening's symposium, I'd like to sing a song which is completely pointless, but is something which I picked up during my career as a scientist.
This may prove useful to some of you some day, perhaps, in a somewhat bizarre set of circumstances. It's simply the names of the chemical elements set to a possibly recognizable tune.

There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium
And hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium
And nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium
And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium
Europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium
And lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium
And gold, protactinium and indium and gallium
And iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium

There's yttrium, ytterbium, actinium, rubidium
And boron, gadolinium, niobium, iridium
And strontium and silicon and silver and samarium
And bismuth, bromine, lithium, beryllium, and barium

Spoken:
Isn't that interesting?  I knew you would. 
I hope you're all taking notes, because there's going 
To be a short quiz next period.

There's holmium and helium and hafnium and erbium
And phosphorus and francium and fluorine and terbium
And manganese and mercury, molybdenum, magnesium
Dysprosium and scandium and cerium and cesium
And lead, praseodymium and platinum, plutonium
Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium
And tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium
And cadmium and calcium and chromium and curium

There's sulfur, californium and fermium, berkelium
And also mendelevium, einsteinium, nobelium
And argon, krypton, neon, radon, xenon, zinc and rhodium
And chlorine, carbon, cobalt, copper, tungsten, tin and sodium

These are the only ones of which
The news has come to Harvard
And there may be many others
But they haven't been discovered"
176,Wynn Stewart,Wishful Thinking,TRGFQFA12903D13D85,1959,"Wishing I could see you again dear
That the fire of love would burn once more
But I guess that's wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

Just thinking how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
But I guess that's wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry

I'll just live my life in dreams and I long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for and it's you I'm thinking of

My heart echoes the love words you spoken
How I wish I could hear them from you
Won't you answer a heart that is broken
And to make my wishful thinking come true

My heart echoes the love words..."
