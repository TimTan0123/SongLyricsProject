0,Billie Holiday,You're My Thrill,TRFRIIR128F4268777,1951,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

Hmmm-nothing seems to matter
Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps morning higher
When I look at you
I cann't keep still
You're my thrill"
1,Billie Holiday,My Man (Mon Homme),TRVXRZE128F429252B,1951,"It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore"
2,Carl Smith,Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way,TRIMUAF128F426BA42,1951,"Darling this is my desire set your little old heart on fire
Do the things that lovers always do
So put your little hand in mine I buy you diamond ring so fine
Then I'll build a bungalow for two
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
So darling turn on all your charms while I hold you in my arms
Let old mother nature have her way
[ steel ]
Now my baby take a chance for I'm just achin' for romance
And know that you were meant for me to love
You know your heart is beatin' fast you know I'm gonna win at last
So cuddle up and be my turtle dove
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
I like to touch your lips to mine like to win your love divine
Let old mother nature have her way
[ guitar ]
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
Cause baby when I hold your hand I feel just like a grown up man
Mother nature says now that's the way"
3,Carl Smith,Me And My Broken Heart,TRDDCWY128F9344362,1951,"We were waiting at the church we watched and saw the weddin' start
As the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart
So can't you see that you have done to me oh foolish foolish pride
You brought tears and sorrow too an untrue heart that never cried

I saw the sunshine of my life who once I know just worshipped me
Standing by another's side and soon his bride she'll be
I bowed my head in grief and shame as I felt the teardrops start
But as the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart"
4,Frankie Laine,Jezebel,TRRYASK12903CD83E6,1951,"If ever a devil was born
Without a pair of horns
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Grieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

If ever a devil was born
Without a pair of horns
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
It was you, Jezebel, it was you!
If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Grieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

Even had I never known
A lover such as you
Forsaking dreams and goals
For the silent scorn
Of your charms, Jezebel!

If ever a devil's plan
Was made to torment man
Decieving me
Drieving me
Leaving me blue
Jezebel, it was you!

Night and day
Every way
Oh Jezebel!
Jezebel

Jezebel!"
5,Hank Williams,Hey Good Lookin',TRBAKLJ128F92F9A46,1951,"Hey, Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me ...
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe. ...

I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me.

Say Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me.

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me
No more lookin', I know I've been (*tooken)
How's about keepin' steady company.

I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents.
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on ev'ry page.

Say Hey, Good Lookin', whatcha got cookin'
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me."
6,Hank Williams,I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You),TRUIMZU128E078985E,1951,"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you."
7,Louis Armstrong,A Kiss To Build A Dream On,TRBPYXX128F426A7A2,1951,"Give me a kiss to build a dream on, 
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss. 
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this: 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

Give me a kiss before you leave me, 
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart. 
Leave me one thing before we part, 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you, 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true. 

Give me your lips for just a moment, 
And my imagination will make that moment live. 
Give me what you alone can give, 
A kiss to build a dream on!"
8,Louis Prima & Keely Smith,Shake Hands With Santa Claus,TRONFJT128F9345347,1951,"Shake hands shake hands shake hands With Santa Claus
If you want some candy, I'll bring you the candy
Shake hands with Santa Claus
I love you I love you and I'm going to bring
Some Candy and flowers and everything
If berries are pleasing' when they're out of season
Shake hands with Santa Claus

I love you I love you and
I'd walk a mile to bring you the berries
And watch you smile Oh Just to share a love like yours
What miracles I would do
I'd make a rainbow and chase the storm
When the weather gets cold I'll make it warm
If you want a cottage I'll furnish the cottage
Shake Hands with Santa Claus
I love you I love you I give you my all
I'm like the genie at your beck and call
If you do the dreaming' I'll do the scheming'

Oh just to win a love like yours
I'd follow you to Capri
I'd kiss you on the streets of Rome
Then we'll eat scungilli then fly back home
If you want bananas, some great big bananas
Shake Hands with Santa Claus
I love you I love you and I'm gonna bring Bananas, Pianos and everything
If you do the dreaming' I'll do the scheming'
Shake hands shake hands shake hands With Santa Claus"
9,Mel Blanc,I Taut I Taw A Puddy Tat,TRKVKSO12903CBA3DF,1951,"Tweety:
I am a little, tiny, bird. My name is Tweety Pie
I live inside my bird cage, a-hanging way up high
I like to swing upon my perch and sing my little song
But there's a tat that's after me and won't let me alone

I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
I did! I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be

Sylvester:
I am that great big bad old cat, Sylvester is my name
I only have one aim in life and that is very plain
I want to catch that little bird and eat him right away
But just as I get close to him, this is what he'll say

I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
You bet he taw a puddy tat, that puddy tat is me

Tweety:
That puddy tat is very bad, he sneaks up from behind
I don't think I would like it if I knew what's on his mind
I have a strong suspicion that his plans for me aren't good
I am inclined to think that he would eat me if he could

Sylvester:
I'd like to eat that sweetie pie when he leaves his cage
But I can never catch him, It throws me in a rage
You bet I'd eat that little bird if I could just get near
But every time that I approach, this is all I hear

Tweety:
I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
I did! I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be

And when I sing that little song, my mistress knows he's back
She grabs her broom and brings it down upon Sylvester's back
So listen you bad puddy tat, let's both be friends and see
My mistress will not chase you if you sing this song with me

Tweety: (Spoken): Come on now, like a good cat
Sylvester: (Spoken): Oh, all right. Sufferin' Succotash

Tweety &amp; Sylvester:
I taut I taw a puddy tat a creepin' up on me
I did! I taw a puddy tat as plain as he could be"
10,Memphis Slim,Mother Earth,TRFQHPW128F424A042,1951,"You may not have me all the time
You may never go my way
Mother earth is laying for you
Cuz of all the debts you got to pay

Don't care how great you are
Don't care what you worth
When it all ends up you got to
Go back to mother earth

You may own a half a city
Even diamonds and pearls
You may buy that plane baby
And fly all over this world

Don't care how rich you are
Don't care what you worth
When it all ends up you got to
Go back to mother earth

You may play race horses
You may own that race track
You may have enough money baby
To buy anything you like

Don't care how great you are
Don't care what you worth
When it all ends up you got to
Go back to mother earth"
11,Muddy Waters,She Moves Me,TRLFWKN128F4251C3C,1951,"She moves me man, honey and I don't see how its done 
She gotta pocket full of money, little doll don't try to help me though 
She move me when she get drunk, then she say I'm not nowhere 
She call me a dumbbell, she tells me I'm nothing but a square 
She moves me man, honey and I don't see how its done 
She got a pocket full of money, the little girl don't try to help me though 
(What kinda woman is that?) 
She move a crazy man, who say now I'm not so dumb 
I take her to a funeral boy, the dead jumped up to run 
She look at a deaf and dumb boy, said now I can speak 
She shook her finger in a blind man's face, once I was blind but now I see 
She moves me man, honey and I don't see how its done 
She gotta pocket full of money, the little girl don't try to help me though"
12,Muddy Waters,Honey Bee,TRKJJEP128F14958A1,1951,"Sail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on

I don't mind you sailing 
But please don't sail so long 

Sail on sail on my little Honey Bee sail on

You gonna keep on sailing 
Take me to your happy home

13,Nat King Cole,Too Young,TRCNZDT128F9307936,1951,"They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all"
14,Nat King Cole,That's My Girl,TROUPJY128F4221063,1951,"That's my girl
Take a look at her, she belongs to me
Yes, that's my girl
Hands off, don't touch

She looks just like an angel
But she's human all the same
So I'm not takin' chances
I won't tell her address or even her name

'Cause that's my girl
I'm addin' her to my family
And I love that girl
And everything's fine

So until the day that she says yes
Keep my fingers crossed
'Cause that's my girl
And she's gonna stay mine

That's my girl, you hear me
I'm addin' her to my family
And I love that girl
And everything's fine

So until the day that she says yes
Keep my fingers crossed
'Cause that's my girl
And she's gonna stay mine

She's all mine, every curvy line
And even those dark brown curls
Now lay off, that's my girl"
15,Roy Acuff,Wreck On The Highway,TRFJAZP128F424E9FB,1951,"Who did you say it was brother?
Who was it fell by the way?
When whiskey and blood run together
Did you hear  anyone  pray?

CHORUS
I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother
I  didn't hear nobody  pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But, I didn't hear nobody pray.

When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart.

There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn't hear nobody pray.

I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody's life is now through.

Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn't hear nobody pray.

CHORUS"
16,Roy Acuff,Low And Lonely,TRFYDFI128F427F317,1951,"Low And  Lonely  sad and  blue
Thinking only of little  you
Always  tryin' to keep from  cryin'
I'm Low And  Lonely  over  you.

CHORUS
Do you  miss me?  Say you  do!
Tell me darlin', please tell  me  true
Do you  yearn dear  for my return dear?
I'm Low And  Lonely  over  you.

Low And Lonely, weary, too
You're the only, true love I knew
Don't be long, dear, you know it's wrong, dear
I'm Low And Lonely over you.

17,Roy Acuff,Wabash Cannonball,TRYELOR128F932ADD0,1951,"Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland, o'er the hills and by the shore 
Hear the rush of the mighty engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call 
He's riding through the jungle on the Wabash Cannnonball 

Now the western states are dandies, so the southern people say 
From Chicago and St. Louis and Peoria by the way  
To the lake of Minnesota, where the rippling waters flow
No chances to be taken on the Wabash Cannonball 

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland, o'er the hills and by the shore  
Hear the rush of the mighty engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call 
He's riding through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball 

She pulled in to the station one cold December day
As she rolled up to the platform, you could hear all the people say 
""Now there's a gal from Birmingham, she's long and she's tall
She came down from Georgia on the Wabash Cannonball""

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland, o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the rush of the mighty engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
He's riding through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Now here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts of all the land
His earthly race is over and as the curtain falls
We'll carry him back to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland, o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the rush of the mighty engine, hear the lonesome hobo's call
He's riding through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball"

Want no silver threads among the go-o-old
Want no silver threads, want some action instead
Want no silver threads among the go-o-old

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old
When there's joy in living you just never grow old
You've got to stay young 'cause you'll never grow old

People who are lonely can be old at thirty-three
Don't let it happen to you, and don't let it happen to me

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
You'll never grow old, no, you'll never grow old
Love and youth and ha-appiness are yours to have and hold 

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old

I-I-I know a man who's lonely and he's old at thirty-three
No one wants to be - old at thirty-three
Your-our-our disposition sours like a lemon on a tree
Don't let it happen to you and don't let it happen to me

Be my life's companion and you'll never grow old
Yes I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old

I've seen trouble all my days 
I bid farewell to old Kentucky 
The place where I was borned and raised

For six long years I've been in trouble 
No pleasure here on earth I find 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
I have no friends to help me now

It's fare thee well my own true lover 
I never expect to see you again 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train

You can bury me in some deep valley 
For many years where I may lay 
Then you may learn to love another 
While I am sleeping in my grave 
(While he is sleeping in his grave) 

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face you'll never will see no more 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life
We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin

And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate

Warmer than May her tender sighs

Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears"
