0,Big Bill Broonzy,Good time Tonight,TROXKSN128F424B15C,1938,"Go down sun, we don't care
We don't like sunshine, we drink moonshine here

Ain't we, baby, ain't we gonna have a time?
Now ain't we baby, we gonna have a good time tonight?

We've got whiskey, wine and gin
We've got hot dogs, ain't got no skin, now

Ain't we, baby, ain't we gonna have a time?
Now ain't we baby, we gonna have a good time tonight?

We've got folks, black and brown
We've got everything, will you stick around?

Ain't we, baby, ain't we gonna have a time?
Now ain't we baby, we gonna have a good time tonight?

When you get high, you want something sweet
We've got something that will knock you off your feet, now

Ain't we, baby, ain't we gonna have a time?
Now ain't we baby, we gonna have a good time tonight?

Come up to my house, wanna have some fun
Bring your money gal, it is easy done

Ain't we, baby, ain't we gonna have a time?
Now ain't we baby, we gonna have a good time tonight?"
1,Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,Prelude To A Kiss,TRYPLGJ12903CF76B4,1938,"If you hear a song in blue
like a flower crying for dew
That was my heart serenading you
MY PRELUDE TO A KISS
If you hear a song that grows
from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A PRELUDE TO A KISS
Though it's just a simple melody
with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony -
a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh!  How my love song gently cries
for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A PRELUDE TO A KISS.
If you hear a song in blue
like a flower crying for dew
That was my heart serenading you
MY PRELUDE TO A KISS
If you hear a song that grows
from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A PRELUDE TO A KISS
Though it's just a simple melody
with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony -
a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh!  How my love song gently cries
for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A PRELUDE TO A KISS."
2,Sleepy John Estes,Special Agent (Railroad Police Blues),TRMMNDO128F422FBE3,1938,"Now, when I left for Ripley, the weather was kinda cool
Now when I left fo' Ripley, the weather was kinda cool
Said boys, y'all be careful, prob'ly you might catch the flu

Now, I swung that manifest, I went down in that freight rail box
Now I hung that manifest, I went down in that freight rail box
Now I couldn't hear the special agent when he come tippin' over the top

Now them special agents up the country, sure is hard on a man
Now them special agents up the country, they sure is hard on a man
Now they will put him off when he hongry, and won't even let him ride no train

Now, I was settin' down in Centralia, and I sure was feelin' bad
Now, I was settin' down in Centralia, and I sure was feelin' bad
Now they wouldn't let me ride no fast train, they put me off on a doggone drag

Now special agent, special agent, put me off close to some town
Special agent, special agent, put me off close to some town
Now I got to do some recording and I oughta be recording right now"
3,Sleepy John Estes,Easin' Back To Tennessee,TRHBKIU128F9307788,1938,"Now, woke up this mornin', couldn't hardly see
Snow on the ground 'bout eight foot deep
Lord, have mercy, baby, what gon' come of me?
You know I feel just like easin' back down into Tennessee

Now Carl Williams in the office wants to see you alone
I can't do nothin' where this white stuff on
Lord, have mercy, baby, what's gon' come of me?
You know I feel just like easin' back down into Tennessee

Now, I'm on the South Side, my buddy on the East
I don't know whether he's got any place to sleep
Lord, have mercy, honey, what's gon' come of me?
You know I feel just like easin' back down into Tennessee

Said, car can't go, [mountain] too slick
Prob'ly might slip back off in a ditch
Lord, have mercy, honey, what's gon' come of me?
You know I feel just like easin' back down into Tennes

Now, twenty-two twenty-four West Hubbard Avenue
That's where you get my 1938 blues
Lord, have mercy, baby, what's gon' come of me?
You know I feel just like easin' back down into Tennessee"
4,Sleepy John Estes,Liquor Store Blues,TRFDJVB128F429F3E1,1938,"Now if you're ever in Forrest City, I'll tell you what to do
Let Mr. Peter Adams get 'quainted with you
Well, you won't have to go, well, you won't have to go
You can get what you want, oh, right chere in my liquor store

He got a little whiskey, he got a little gin
All you got to do is step in the back end
Well, you won't have to go, well, you won't have to go
You can get what you want, oh, right chere in my liquor store

I met Mr. Peter down on Monroe Street
Come to Forrest City to run around with me
Well, you won't have to go, well, you won't have to go
You can get what you want, oh, right chere in my liquor store

He got some on the floor, he got some on the shelf
All you got to do is just to help yourself
Well, you won't have to go, well, you won't have to go
You can get what you want, oh, right chere in my liquor store

Mr. Peter Adams, this kind of man
You ask him for a favor he won't make you ashamed
Well, you won't have to go, well, you won't have to go
You can get what you want, oh, right chere in my liquor store"
5,Sleepy John Estes,Clean Up At Home,TRZJGKX128F422FBDD,1938,"I wash my clothes, I hang 'em by the fire
Get up in the mornin' they be thoroughly dry
Clean up at home, clean up at home
Clean up at home, I 'clare you can't go wrong

I went to the beer tavern, tryin' to make me a dime
Said, ""Go 'way, boy, clean up and git on some time.""
Clean up at home, clean up at home
Clean up at home, I 'clare you can't go wrong

Five cents cap and ten cent suit
Then y'all think I'm tryin' to act cute, I want to
Clean up at home, clean up at home
Clean up at home, I 'clare you can't go wrong

I was doin' somethin' that you can't do
Go 'round on State Street, get a woman for a pot of stew, you have to
Clean up at home, you have to clean up at home,
Clean up at home, I 'clare you can't go wrong

I played for the colored, I played for the white
All you got to do, act kinda nice, you got to
Clean up at home, you got to clean up at home
Clean up at home, 'clare you can't go wrong"
6,Tampa Red,Seminole Blues,TRPCHAB12903D12073,1938,"My baby's gone, won't be back no mo'
She won't be back no mo', whoa-ooh
My baby's gone, she won't be back no mo'
She left this mo'nin', she caught that Seminole

I got the blues so bad
It hurt my tongue to talk
It hurt my tongue to talk, ooh-ooh
The blues so bad
It hurt my tongue to talk
I would follow my baby
But it hurt my feet to walk

She gimme her love
Even let me draw her pay
She let me draw her pay, yeah
She give me her love
Even let me draw her pay
She was a real good woman
But unkindness drove her 'way

I've got the Seminole blues
Leaving on my mind
Leaving on my mind, whoa-ooh
Seminole blues, leaving on my mind
I'm goin' to find my baby
If I have to ride the blind."
