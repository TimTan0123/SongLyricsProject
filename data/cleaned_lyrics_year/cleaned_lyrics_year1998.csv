0,Pluto,The Goodbye Girl,TRWHIJT128F92CCF43,1998,"I put down the phone
And feel more alone
Than I did before it rang
And you were there. (Yeah Yeah)
I go back to bed
And those things you said
Run around inside my head
And I can't sleep. (Oh No)
Chorus:
Don't say goodbye to the Goodbye Girl
Just say see you soon
I say goodbye to the Goodbye Girl
And it's our nineteenth honeymoon.
So I'm late for work
And you're such a jerk
But I can't stay mad
Cause you're so far away. (Hey Hey)
So I'm home again
I'm alone again
But I only feel
Remotely in control. (Whoa Whoa)
I don't even know her name
Don't know when I'll get a
Chance to talk to her again
Chorus:
Don't say goodbye to the Goodbye Girl
Just say see you soon
I say goodbye to the Goodbye Girl
And it's our nineteenth honeymoon.
Pay telephone from a twilight zone
And I'm hanging on the line
I fell in love with the Goodbye Girl
Now I'll never say goodbye.

They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain

Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers

Bringing the blood of a newborn child, yeah
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the Valley of Kings

Take this white cross and go
To the center of the ring

Yeah, yeah, and become Lucifer's child

e) Evil

I was born in the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry

And when you're down
Beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady pray, and say goodbye, goodbye
Oh lady pray, and say goodbye

Yeah, you've gotta say goodbye
Yeah, 'cause I will eat your mind"
3,Cab Calloway,The Man From Harlem,TRCWNZM128F93283F4,1998,"It was up at Mike's the other night,  
There was really quite a sight, 
Gather round, folks, while I give you all the lowdown. 

Tables were filled with gaudy frails, 
Chewing on their fingernails; 
They were waiting for the man from Harlem. 

Drinks were served six bits a throw, 
Things were moving kind of slow, 
Everybody's nerves were getting jumpy. 

All at once the room was still, 
Men forgot all about their bill, 
Who should enter but the man from Harlem. 

Everybody rolled their eyes, 
Women starting heaving sighs, 
Someone hollered, ""Music, lights and gin,"" 

Everybody cleared a space, 
They had big, broad smiles on every face, 
How they all loved to see the man from Harlem. 

When he started in to step 
He filled everyone with plenty pep, 
He twitched and squirmed; it just was a dirty shame. 

Everyone was in a daze, 
Women watched him with amaze, 
Each one said she'd have the man from Harlem. 

He looked over in the corner, 
And saw a couple of frails and they sure did look kinda low. 
Another cat walked up, and said to the man from Harlem, 
""Go over there and see what's the matter with them girls."" 
And they said, ""I'm kinda low."" 
And he said, ""I've got just what you need: 
Come on, sisters, light up on these weeds and get high and forget about everything."""
4,T. Graham Brown,Wine Into Water,TRBCWXT12903CF22F8,1998,"You've heard a multitude of prayers on my behalf 
I pray one more is not too much to ask 
I've tried to fight this battle by myself 
But its a war that I cant win without your help 

Tonight im as low 
As any man can go 
Im down and I cant fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees im turning to ya father 
Can you help me turn the wine back into water 

So many times i've hurt the ones I love 
I've pushed them to the edge of giving up 
They've stood by me but how much can they stand 
If I dont put this bottle in your hand 

Tonight im as low 
As any man can go 
Im down and I cant fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees im turning to ya father 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water 

I shook my fists at heaven 
For all the hell that ive been through 
Now im begging for forgiveness 
And a miracle from you 

Cause tonight im as low 
As any man can go 
Im down and I cant fall much farther 
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine 
Now on my knees im turning to ya father 
Could you help me turn the wine back into water 

Could you help me turn this wine back into water 

Yeah yeah"
5,4Him,Before The River Came,TRCEOTS128F930F536,1998,"I've been lookin' at the past
I've wasted too much time
On things that won't last
I've built a kingdom out of rubble and sand
But I don't, I don't want to hold on to it all
I'm ready for the river to run and wash it away
I'm singin'
Come sweet water
Cleanse my soul
Shower me
And make me whole
Consume me with healing flood
Leave no traces of the man that I was
Before the river came

There's no freedom in the chains
They hold you captive to the guilt of your stains
One drop of water brings
an ocean of change
And I long, I long to move on from it all
I'm ready for the river to run and wash it away
I'm singin'

(CHORUS)

Baptize and bury me
Until only You remain (come and rescue me)
I don't want to be the man that I was
Long before the river came

(CHORUS)"
6,The Del McCoury Band,Rain & Snow,TRFVIRR12903CB8F5C,1998,"I married me a wife
She give me trouble all my life
Left me out in the cold rain and snow

Rain and snow, oh Lord
Left me out in the cold rain and snow

She came down the stairs
Combing back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose

As a rose, oh Lord
And her cheeks were as red as a rose

I've done all I can do
To try and get along with you
And I ain't going to be treated this a-way

This a-way, oh Lord
And I ain't going to be treated this a-way

She came into the room
Where she met her final doom
And I ain't going to be treated this a-way

This away, oh Lord
And I ain't going to be treated this a-way"
7,DMX / L.O.X. / Mase,Niggaz Done Started Something,TRNHWCF128E07862CB,1998,"Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with holes up in skyscrapers
In condiminiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole commity like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggaz who pump on yo' block and in yo' spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin you? 
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, frontin, frontin in eclipsesis

Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We takin knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The rack of sing-sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggaz names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughin blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a Tec at Ma$e, and, have a explanation
You bring your crew and em and I'm doin em
Then I'm beatin em down with aluminum
Then I'm puttin two in em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggaz done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggaz done started somethin

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggaz done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggaz done started somethin

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggaz done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggaz done started somethin

Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sippin margaritas wit a mami
Cleanin my Tommy, showin love to my army
Whenever The LOX find rippy blocks, we kill em
Yeah I hear niggaz, but I still don't feel em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissin us
My 16's be so real, you can feel em in your vain
Like Ramello's pops from Sugarhill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spittin clips at your face
We started from the bottom
You'll see bad niggaz pardon, whatever
We can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real big
I'm makin niggaz blow trial even if they not guilty

I want a palace for my thugs, wit oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get wacked for the love
Twenty niggaz batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only gettin up, splittin up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggaz handin me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understandin me
Sittin at the table, plannin and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle
Any ya niggaz done started somethin
Actin invincible like you god or somethin
If you god, then I'ma makes a lot til you rot 
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start bustin off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggaz done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggaz done started somethin

Don't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution
Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggaz fearin, fuck whatchu heard, this whatchu hearin
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggaz flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggaz see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be puttin on that tag on yo' toe
Now who gon tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
so you got whatchu came for
What's that?

Surgery wit the chainsaw grrrrr, I hit the fuckin streets
cause like I said before ain't nothin goin down until I eat
Mu'fuckers think it's all about impressin bitches and stressin bitches
Well, I'm testin bitches game, adressin bitches, and caressin bitches
And dealin wit mu'fuckers on all levels
What I'm dealin wit is all devils, fuckin with snakes
Runnin wit niggaz you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggaz, dirty niggaz
That come through and worry niggaz
30 niggaz that like to bury niggaz
And scary niggaz get it all the time
Cause what they got is all of mine
Your man was talkin shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you wit my man, then he gettin stuck witchu
And gave it the money
Cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest
Then I tossed the nine, boss of crime
Black Gotti, I stack bodies wit the black shotty
Bitch-ass niggaz who act snotty
Get it

These niggaz is for real
These niggaz ain't playin

This ain't no fuckin game
You think we playin?
Ruff Ryders
Grrrrrr"
8,Roger Creager,Let It Roll,TRCSDNK128F421D299,1998,"Creager/Elliott/Ingram

I'd like to take this time to thank people who are gathered around me here
At least we've come this far on a really tough road
There are night we sank so low lord it seems hard to imagine
You picked me up and helped me carry the load
Sometimes I sing to an empty house and some nights I pack 'em in
It's hard to know if I'm waiting to lose or losing to win
It takes a lot of good folks to open up doors you gotta knock again and again
You gave me what I needed so thank you for believing I think I got one foot in

Chorus
So here I go one more time giving all I've got word by word and line by line
One more town at a time Loving what I do laying it all on the line

Pack up the gear get out on the highway I gotta keep movin I guess I'll see you around
Maybe in some small cafe with my case at my feet on the ground 
One things for certain one thing I know nothings gonna slow me down
I'm gonna let it roll gonna lay it down same old song
In a brand new town I hope they care sometimes they don't
I ain't scared just let it roll"

You can tell your friends how many times I made you cry
You can tell anyone anything you want
But if you're gonna talk about how I deserved what you did
You can look now 'cause I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm might be a lot of things
And yeah it's right I'm not always truthful
But it's a matter of fact that I'm happy being me
And I don't wanna be you
It's not good enough
Anything I say
I don't give a fuck what you think anymore anyway
Things you've said are taking their fucking toll
Eroded my confidence and almost took my soul
And why you list all the reasons
Why I deserve what I get
You'll have to watch me as I go
Here I go"
10,DAVE MATTHEWS BAND,Don't Drink The Water,TRWFCZP128F93074E1,1998,"Don't drink the water, yeah

Come out, come out
No use in hiding
Come now, come now
Can you not see?
There's no place here
What were you expecting?
No room for both
Just room for me
So you will lay your arms down
Yes, I will call this home

Away, away
You have been banished
Your land is gone
And given to me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes, I will call this home
What's this you say?
You feel the right to remain
Then stay, and I will bury you

What's that you say?
Your father's spirit still lives in this place
Well, I will silence you

Here's the hitch
Your horse is leaving
Don't miss your boat
It's leaving now
And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes, I will call this home
I have no time to justify to you
Fool, you're blind, move aside for me
All I can say to you, my new neighbor
Is you must move on, or I will bury you

Now, as I rest my feet by this fire
Those hands once warmed here
Well, I have retired them
I can breathe my own air
And I can sleep more soundly
Upon these poor souls
I'll build Heaven and call it home
'Cause you're all dead now
And I live with my justice
And I live with my greedy need
Or I live with no mercy
And I live with my frenzied feeding
I live with my hatred
And I live with my jealousy
Or I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me
Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water 
Don't drink the water

Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water

Gonna give it up definitely.  Take it to another level - grab the shovel
And scoop the rest out of my way.  Giddy like a school boy
Got the tools, boy - never play the unemployed.  Comin' with
Velocity with the needles in the red - think i lost my sanity

Here we come again - bring another jam, with the mic in my hand
Yeah you know we slam.  Moving forward with momentum
Straight to hell, that's where we sent'em.  Sometimes freaky
Sometimes we get nice - if feels good sometimes we do it twice
Or three times or four times or five or six.  REWIND! The tape
Get me back in the mix..  We'd like to thank our friends for a hell of
A time, we hope it never ends.  Crack a little smile when it's time to get
High
So!

Perpetrator
Make me look down on the up stroke, cause I got no love for the evil
Imitator. I live to hear the people yellin' and screamin' and clappin' and
Toe tappin'. Ain't gonna be no gum flappin'. To shun - To shun...
To just turn away.

That's all right that's all right 
Who'd I'd ever be to care? 
Just like honey from the bees 
So nice I'd like to do it twice 
Who'd I'd ever be to care? 

Just like way back in the days of Motown 
We all used to get together and sing our songs of love 
But they're all the same 
But it sure has been a long time since Motown came to my town 
My mom was still dancing 
Black man sing a song of romance that's all he needs 
A little girl to make his life complete 
Just like singing a serenade beneath your windowsill 
Slow dancing on a Friday night 

I've been dreaming of you all afternoon 
The sun was shining I near about fell in love 
In the park with the woods to wonder 
Do you wanna be my lover 
Won't you cry when you miss me we fit just right 
I know because I saw it in your eyes 
You look a little angry baby 
But don't you know that's just the way I love you 
Don't you know that's just the way I love you

I'm losing my direction
Something's come between us
It's gettin' hard to do right
I'm searchin' for a sign
They've split us into sections
I'm from mars and your from venus
But stranded in the daylight
Nothin' is defined
But as the late summer honey light
Shifts and caresses the buildings...

Dark starry eyes
Searching the skies
Because it's hidden from view
Don't mean it isn't for you
You know we're gonna make it
We've only gotta take it
Cos' it's a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue

I've made a big decision
In the light of the eternal
I'm gonna be your mirror
And you can mirror me
I'll see you in the bright star
Cushioned by the dark sky
Reflected in the river
Flowing to the sea
And as the reasons and rumours recede
Dyin' on the lesseing breeze

Sweet starry eyes
Immune to surprise
Because it's hidden from view
Don't mean it isn't for you
You know we're gonna make it
We've only gotta take it
And it's a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue

And blue is the colour of my heart
Since you blew my senses apart
The feeling we're back at the start never ends
As clusters of heavenly jewels
Gaze down on earth's lonely fools
Turnin' and twistin'
Resisting the pull of a fate that's already planned
They can't understand

Dark starry eyes
Searching the skies
Because it's hidden from view
Don't mean it isn't for you
You know we're gonna make it
We've only gotta take it
It's a dark, dark sky
Holds the north star high
And guides us and bathes us
In stillness and sameness and blue
I'm placing my faith in the brilliance
Of the bright stars and you."

Less the Sweet Waters of Habsu
Chthhulhu Amah-Ushumgal-Anna
Triumvirate of Most High

Spirits of the Deep Waters, remember
Humbaba, Lord of the Forest, remember

From the Sweet Bitter all that is came
Creation of man and their gods
But man, fashioning overwhelm
Could not see the Light which he holds

Spirits of Purifying Flames, remember
Anunna, Gods of the Skies, remember
Anunnaki, Judges of Ur, remember
Anunnaki, Weighers of the Truth, be praised

The gift of flesh
Was in fact life's curse
Although born one in the same
In Spirit, but the flesh all too coarse

Discord, among the gods of men
Although they were brothers
Diversities grew
Overshadowing their connection
On the clearest of days they are
One in the same
Pettiest of purpose
Degenerates things to their crudest form
Being loathsome to Habsu

Warring, in the Belly of Tiamat
Brothers do battle
Principalities of folly
Disturb the Mummu
The One Who Bore All Was
Appalled by their ways
Her Dream Time was of no peace
Their fleshly behavior
Overbeating and proud
She despised them
Zi Zi Anunnaki, Kanpa

The Ways of the Underworld are Perfect
Not to be questioned by that of the brute
Clearly beyond the understanding
Of that which is ruled by the drives of the flesh
For whom shall then oppose
The Lights of Asag, Purifying Flames
Come child, the Anunnaki wait
Truth is the Weapon no pity it holds

The ways of the flesh
Barbaric behavior patterns
Flesh over Spirit, the motivator of the worthless
The ways of the flesh
The evolution is minimal
I watch as your kingdoms rise and fall
Causing no effective change
Your military
Command structure of impotence
A gross misuse of force
By leaders who lack in vision
Your gods
Evidence of your weakness
Your focus is one with delusion
You worship that which means your end

Rise up, O Mahummuhu
The Judgement is passed
The treachery is clear
They shalt become empty like the wind
The emptiest of shells so shall they be
O Great Mother
The Armies shall rise with Weapons
No pity they hold
From Your Great Mummu
The Serpents shall come
Venom for blood
And the Glory of Gods

Spirits of the Flames, remember
Anunna, Gods of the Skies, remember
Anunnaki, Judges of Ur, remember

Slaves and shadows ... caged in this twilight

Somewhere inside, you will hear this sound
You will understand what turns me inside out

You will fear the nature of evil
Will you see me screaming
You will fear the nature of evil

Will you hear me calling
Ooh oh
The nature of evil

In the room, cold as a grave
I pray for rescue but no one cares
Exposed the truth, raised up from the dead
This curse has left a part in my head

I'm out here alone ... in the darkest wasteland
In deepest trouble, a stranded man

(Chorus 3)

Baby hear me calling
The nature of evil

26,Dick Curless,Loser's Cocktail,TRLPFSX128F934CB71,1998,"Well, I'm the bartender at the Loser's Lounge
And my fame has spread all over this town
I mix the drink that gives the place its name
And what it does to men is a downright shame

I mix gin sin and a little bit a where you been
That's the start of a loser's cocktail
'Cause I mix wine time with this'll get her off your mind
And I call it a loser's cocktail

Then other kinda losers come in every night
Take off their rings and slip 'em outa sight
They try to make out with the girls at the bar
Then I mix 'em the drinks that I'm famous for

I mix beer cheer with she'll never know you've never been here
I make them a loser's cocktail
'Cause I mix rum for some with, yeah, that little chick is dumb
Then I serve them a loser's cocktail

No matter what they order they all end up the same
It's what you put in it that's the name of the game
Some of the losers come here to forget
While the rest still haven't even found out yet

I mix beer tears with a lotta wishin' she was here
That's a part of a loser's cocktail
'Cause I mix gin sin with, yeah, I'll be seeing you again
And I call it a loser's cocktail

I mix beer tears with a lotta wishin' she was here"
27,Martin Sexton,My Maria (LP Version),TRBBGDK128F427D450,1998,"Oh my Maria
Seems you got me in your spell once more
Must be there's a storm on the way
You taught me to know when you're near
In your glance
Recall my shady days of youth
Stealing altar wine and microphones
Not so blindly fueling my need
As rock and roll fueled my dreams
You know rock and roll fueled my dreams
Back then you saw me as this child
In great need of the wildest sin
How sweet your grace I stumbled in
And how completely you waved
As I laughed in your face
Oh my Maria
Oh my Maria
How you stood for strength and sanity
Now is there someone poking holes in thee
I see now why you called me near
Maria my song can you hear
I know you see the silence on the sidewalk
And the anger in the street
And the voices of all these children
Coming up to my feet
And we sing your song in vain
As some preacher sees his reign
Come down
Maria
Oh my sweet, Maria
In the silence on the hill
You know I'll be dreaming of you still
Maria, oh my Maria
I sing for my Maria
I sing for my Maria"
28,The Meads of Asphodel,Book of Dreams,TRPXILP12903CEB149,1998,"I recall the smokeless fire where the stars are born
Set within the night
I have heard the twilight whispers of the unknown god
Dragon son of dawn.
I have touched the face of magic, wormwood shadows
Enchanted abyss
I have seen the war in heaven, no fucking heroes
'til the bitter end

Hark the gleaming red serpent entwined in imprisoned waters
The great deceiver of men, clothed in the secrets of creation
It is the keeper of locusts that swarm in the bemoaning pit
Where tragedy shall unfold before the eyes of heaven
And the dead shall be awakened and thereafter all hell
Shall spew forth her forsaken sons in one last celestial conflict
Where darkness shall be vanquished forever."
29,Cradle Of Filth,Thirteen Autumns And A Widow,TRPWPYK128F4259F5A,1998,"Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead, her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From crag-jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease

Through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
(Gilded in crests of Carpathian breed)
Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the new-born
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
(A tragedy crept to the name Bathory)

Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth

She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
Never were her dreams so maniacally cruel
(And possessed of such delights)
For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards she abhored
Not her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord

I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For his gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With him undead for three long nights

Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to her door
Tombed her soul with such stone
For she swore the priest sighed
When she knelt down to atone....

She feared the light
So when she fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white....

The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
'Pon the grave of her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
That she kissed the Devil's phallus
By her own decree....

So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve she fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm, astride her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the soceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair

Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared her
In even darker themes

Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths, elder ill-omen
Elizabeth came to life again

And under lacerations of dawn she returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as she rode
Through the mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows

She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes six-tripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed, thirteen Autumns had passed
And she was a widow from God and his wrath finally...."

Out there, somewhere
I'd been looking hard, searching every heart
Getting nowhere
Didn't know I was making my way to you

Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels

Miles of loneliness, now make perfect sense
Here beside you
Tears like water fall, it was worth it all
Just to find you
And yours are the last arms I'll run to

Now I know how the river feels
When it reaches the sea
And finally finds the place
It was always meant to be
Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you
I know how the river feels

Holding fast, home at last
Knowing the journey's through
Lying here with you

Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me
but at least I became the wall of decades.

drew upon the sand...

34,The Ataris,San Dimas High School Football Rules,TRUXQRW128F427ED75,1998,"Last night I had a dream that we went to Disneyland,
Went on all the rides, didn't have to wait in line.
I took you to your house where we stared up at the stars
I listened to your heartbeat as I held you in my arms.

We hung out at the Rainbow where we drank 'till half past two.
Nothing could go wrong anytime that I'm with you.
Like crashing a hotel room or leading up to that first kiss
Or searching for a high school that you know doesn't exist...

These are the things that make me free
I feel like I'm stuck in stand by me
This night was too good to be true.

Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me,
I want us to be something that we'd probably never be.
Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show,
But now I'm stuck debating if I even want to know.

Whitney, don't you understand that what I say is true?
I just want you to know I have a major crush on you.
I'd drive you to Las Vegas and do the things you wanna do
I'd even have Wayne Newton dedicate a song to you.

I only wish that this could be
Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me
I swear I'd treat you like a queen. A queen."
35,Dimmu Borgir,The promised future aeons,TRSTHRV128F14A1518,1998,"Erotic and dreamlike still in its mortal disguise
A passionate ritual in the ruined garden theatre
The painted angels - shadowed high above.
Once they gathered to worship at the picture of me.
Like a whisper where there are no words,
appears the perplexed - the statue of might.
In the cradle of the next generation,
a spiraling ruin - lost in the gathering dust.

...The faces you saw in the withering garden.
I witnessed the flikering - made to look like stone.
Quivering like little figures lost in broken flames,
never to forget again the names carved in horrid flesh.

Those words drawn in water - become our legacy of fantasies!

Burn the pictures,
so unexpected in this strange deserted place.
Once opened, its secrets would become the world,
its attributes would continue to unfold forever.

""Through the fabric of the promised future aeons,
I offer this suffering of my unwanted father...""

...And the stars did wander - separated in the forbidden universe!"

My Deed is done, Betrayer got 
What he deserved

Here is my place
I must live alone, with my dreams
Of Darkness and Purity

No one can understand my way of life
So, nothing but Hate remains

You said you are The True One, 
But that you were NOT.
Your body is now buried
And to Hell your soul will be send

I said to you that Traitors
Will be Punished,
So enjoy your trip to
The Realm Of The Master.

Rites of Immortality
Still echoes in My mind,
When I am remembering our Coven

Those deeds of Darkness
Were best times of My life

Now I am only waiting...
...That The Lord shall Arise"

A bad time, nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out
He got up out of there, ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knee
Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw,
Delivered him wings, ""Hey, look at me now...""
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh – ah, ohhh...

He's - flying! Home
High! Wide! Home...

He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share
His key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped, then he was stabbed
By faceless men, well...fuckers, he still stands.
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly

Flying! Home...
High! Flying! Home...
He's Flying! Home...
Ohh, oahh...Home..."

I can't wait till June when we get our royalties

It was spent on plies of cocaine
Take your wallet's out and buy some merchandise
We've got records and shirts at an inflated price
Please spend what you can so we can buy a new van
Our old one broke down in Spokane
Thanks for shelling out cash to come and see our shows
You've been paying our rent and you've been buying us clothes
We love to see your faces out on tour
But more than that we hate to come home poor
Join our fanclub, buy our posters, idolize us today

That let this feeling grow
There were so many times we could have said goodbye
We could have called it quits but honey you and I

We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough to fight
Together in this thing for life

There were times I lost my mind
Took some wrong turns you got me back in line
There were times you lost control
But I stood by you I loved you heart and soul
When faith was tested and dreams were fading fast
We held each other close until the rain had passed

We're survivors we made it through the storm
When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms
Survivors in love enough to fight
Together in this thing for life

A little time and tenderness
Has seen us through the years
We'll still be side by side
When the final smoke has cleared

When I've needed shelter I've found it in your arms

Driving fast to find you
I feel familiar winds that usher in each evening heavy on the mountains
Rest clouds left there since morning
You always said
""There's just no other place""

A sign nailed to a redwood signifies arrival ""welcome to the Lost Coast""
My mind begins to wonder
It was here we lost each other
Shifting to a low gear
As I start on down the mountain
I know now
Those were the times of my life

1989 was a dream in a dream
We straddled the thin line between
What it means or it seems to be
Sure enough we left the world behind
It reminds me now
How precious and how delicate

The hairpins come more frequent
Each turn extending to the edge
Without a barrier
I feel my stomach sinking
Whatever you've been thinking
Nine years all but vanished
Now it's nine miles to the ocean
And shelter cove
Where we found a night

And now I see that night
As a dream in a dream
The fire flickered calming light
Oh how perfect it seemed
To be yours alone in such a distant place you faced me and you whispered
""This is wonderful""

Later on at the lighthouse
We were warned we should be careful
By waves that shot above us
We were told there was a hurricane
That came ashore each evening

I still carry the picture
That I took while you were sleeping
Too hard to look
Just then I see it again

The ocean through the clouds
Like a dream in a dream
All the houses down in Shelter Cove
How much smaller they seem
Was I really wise to improvise
And return to this scene
1989 just a dream in a dream
I can only hope this Lost Coast can remember so I turn my car off
I can almost feel you here"

That's all there is at stake
It should be getting easier
I don't know what it is
I feel myself falling apart
I wish I could start...again
I wish I could start again
I wish I could start
I've known these parts
I've known this loneliness
I've known these parts

Just the first few seconds after i first seen her

Like my, favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
A home run pitch floatin right down the middle
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's no red lights, when ive over slept
She's a three point jump shot thats nothin but net
A hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin
Im forever on a roll thats how shes, got me feelin

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's the best cook thats ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
Theres absolutley no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She goes direct, to my heart

Through the eyes of the Oracle
Can I ask a question?
What does the future hold?

Sign of the times my friend
So much at your fingers' ends
Sign of the times my friend
Never reaching things you see

Life passing quickly
see the eyes of the Oracle
Can I ask a question?
What's left for me?

Came see the Oracle the prophet looks my way
No tricks or crystal gazing, No words to say
open your mind to every single thing you see
All that's good and evil will be frozen in your dreams

So walk with me my friend there's nothing left to fear
The things you hope to see have never been so near
Now every day will hold a brighter sun you'll say
I'd pray for darkness it's the price of sight you'll pay"

I'll tell you a secret, baby, I let go first
If I was still holding on, then maybe I'd feel worse
But I seen this day coming, so it don't bother me
I've already set you free

But, boy, you took your time
I'd begun to wonder
If you had changed your mind

Burn her name

She'll break a promise as a matter of course
Because she thinks it's fun to have no remorse
She gets what she wants and walks away
And she doesn't give a fuck what you might say
Because it cuts her up like Irish mortar
Mother's pride is what we taught her
Soiled and petty as we happily taunt her
Friend and enemy we're all to blame

She'll flaunt her fame
She'll make us remember, remember her name}x2

She could win this game and be the queen for good
Save herself up for the cream of the crop
Then she'll look us up when she's ready to stop

De nuestro pueblo
Tendremos una casa

Me quedaré en silencio.

Y destruiré la casa,
Me quedaré... en el pueblo.
Olvida lo que dije,

Se están vistiendo
Y tú tienes que irte
Con todos ellos.

Broke through the rocks, broke through straight towards the sun

Stygian light winks through the clouds
Retched into this heart of mine
Shines onto my life from nothingness
And I ravished the rays of sunshine
Unfinished we participate in the run of life, our inner strife
Hidden inside us the need to end, to end our pain

One with nature, spoilt, without a zest for life
Sparkling bodies embraced by ebony nights

""Sometimes all our words are inadequate for the burden of our hearts""

Once ashes we will be and still the hunger for a new life
Or a soon coming death
And the dust we will crumble to will be the companion
Of the four winds wailing over our souls

The ashes still the hunger of a new coming death
The dust is the companion of the four winds from our hearts"

She looks so frail beside you as she wears her sick disguise
You say she'll soon be better as you dry her tearful eyes
You tell her fairy stories, she tries to understand
She looks to you for comfort and holds out her little hand.

But early in the morning when the sun shines into her tiny room
She wakes up like a bird and she's fine again.

You gently kiss her forehead and from the room you creep
But you linger in the doorway as she whimpers in her sleep
Her cheeks are flushed like sunset and her head's an open fire
All night she turns and tosses as her temperature gets higher.

But early in the morning when the sun shines into her tiny room
She wakes up like a bird and she's fine again.

The night light in the corner casts a soft and peaceful glow
Her face becomes much cooler and her breathing much more slow
She dreams of clowns and princes sailing boats and trains
The fairies come by moonlight to take away her pain.

And early in the morning when the sun shines into her tiny room
She wakes up like a bird and she's fine again
She wakes up like a bird and she feels fine
She wakes up like a bird and she feels fine
She wakes up like a bird and she feels fine."

Then send it to your block and have my full name cemeented
And if your rhymes sound like mine, I'm taking a percentage
Unprecedented and still respected when it vintage
I'm serious, I'm taking over areas in Aquarius
Running red lights with my 10,000 chariotes
Just as Christ was a superstar, you stupid star
They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down
And make you face it, if you slit the bag open
And put your pinky in it, then taste it

E poi un giorno tu
Incontrerai una folla
Che correndo ti trascinerà
Ma se cadi non ti aiuterà
Da bambino non sei solo
Ma da uomo puoi sperare
Che una donna ti sorrida
Mille cose scoprirai
Ma se cadi non ti aiuterà
Da bambino guardi il cielo
Ma da uomo hai l’amore
Da bambino scopri il sole
Ma da uomo hai l’amore"

Someone you forgot you used to know
You were looking for rhymes and reason
They forgot the things you used to know
You came to rely on good fortune
Your mother's screaming low
With the sky in the eye
And jump through the window

You've made your own room at the top
But it's getting thin on air
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair
And when you're feeling fit to drop
And you find there's no one there
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair

You don't wanna shout about it
But it's nothing you care to know
Your friends they just laugh about it
In the places that you never go
You cannot deny your good fortune
Your friends they won't let go
See your hair is in place
And see away from the window

You've made your own room at the top
But it's getting thin on air
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair
And when you're feeling fit to drop
And you find there's no one there
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair

You're the judge how high it hangs
When your castle's made of sand
Because the people who kill the king
Are the people who move from within
You can't rely on good fortune
Your friends are crying low
Kick your feet from the chair
And let it slip from the gallow

You've made your own room at the top
But it's getting thin on air
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair
And when you're feeling fit to drop
And you find there's no one there
Still you look at me from your most expensive chair"

Told everyone I'm doing fine
Learned how to get on with my life
I just want what's best for her
So I lied
Found a note on my door last night
Said, ""I'll be your friend 'till the day I die""
But you should know I found someone
Now she's in love

I tear at the lid I'm suffering
In a cold and nameless grave
If Hell is what awaits me
I feel no fright

Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If there's a God in heaven
Hear my call from the grave......

86,Backyard Babies,Ghetto You,TRUJMUZ128F932BADF,1998,"You wanna hear a story
A story 'bout a broken man
You're just trippin' nowhere
Or is it hard for you to understand
That I'm a man

I'm so sick and tired of you
You better not touch me
I'm so sick and tired of you
And the crazy things you do
I'm getting sick and tired
I'm getting sick and tired

And I'll die just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't never gonna cry

So you wanna hear another story
Another story in a different place
But when it comes to lovin'
I will leave you with a broken face
'Cause I'm a man

I'm so sick and tired of you
You better not touch me
I'm so sick and tired of you
And the crazy things you do
I'm getting sick and tired
I'm getting sick and tired

And I'll die just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't never gonna cry
No way

I don't believe that I will live forever
But I do believe that I will die
And I'm gonna drive by a hundred miles
'Cause I'm a high-flying sucker with a super smile

Die 
Just to get to you
Baby, I will lie just to get to you
But I ain't gonna cry
Just to get to you
Baby, I will die
Just to get to you
Baby, I will die, die
Just to get to you
And, baby, I will lie
Just to get to you
But I ain't gonna cry
Just to get to you
But, baby, I will die
Just to get to you"

89,Michael Stanley Band,Midwest Midnight,TRLKYTX128F424CF67,1998,"With thirteen lovers I hid beneath the covers
got staples in my hands for my time
With the radio low so the folks don't know
I proceed with my passion of crime...
And though somewhat obtuse, I've been told this abuse
will more than likely make me go blind
But with a heart that's aching, it's a risk worth taking
'cause true love, they say, is so hard to find...

Why can't she see what she's doing to me
If that bandstand girl only was here
And I'm living the dream, getting lost on the screen,
doing Presley in front of the mirror...
Hanging around, getting high on the sounds
of the ladies and electric guitars
Cross a double yellow line to who knows where
with six sets of glory a night in some bar...

(CHORUS:)
Midwest midnight
Ten thousand watts of holy light
from my radio so clear...
Bodies glistening, everybody's listening
as the man plays all the hits that you want to hear.

With a will to believe, and my songs on my sleeve
If only I'd known from the start
Such a sensitive toy, for a suburban boy
who believed he was suffering for art...
But then something went wrong
and he watched as his songs
met a slow death of silence, but worse
He was taken to task, by some critic who asked,
""Do you write the words or lyrics first...""

(CHORUS)

BRIDGE:
I hear 'em callin':
""Boy, you should be grateful
to get your foot inside the door.
You know there's thousands out there
who would take your place...
This attitude of yours, my son,
well, it lacks the due respect...
You bite the hand that feeds you--
even if you're never fed...""

Chasing the fame keeps 'em all in the game
But money's still the way they keep score
And nobody told you that you would get older
strung out like some Avenue whore...
Waiting release, getting shot through the grease,
some L.A. madonna's maligned
And New York's calling just to see if you've heard
'bout the great English band
they just signed....

Take me back to...
(CHORUS:)
Midwest midnight
Ten thousand watts of holy light
from my radio so clear...
Bodies glistening, is anybody listening?
Does the man still play all the hits that you want to hear.."

Father of time.

In the glorious night standing proud groundless...

Our wings will carry your winds of hate,
Across thundering blood red clouds
Fire by fire, blessed through lightnings in times
before light,
We were sets on your prophecies...

Regie Sathanas!!!

Pleasure of flesh, pleasure of sins,
In these times we reveal our supremacy,
To the one who pretends to give a legacy...
By my function in the great order of Agaliarepth,
I'll take these steps once again to raise the temple of mockeries
An edifice to the nocturnal glory has taken place
in the tormented mind that I possess.
No... Shame passes through my hatred spirit,
which relish this obscure rape of morality.

Within the halls of thy self-minded church,
The daughter of innocent lays naked,
Surrounded by the scorching black unholy wax...
Running along the virgin womb,
the candles' blood makes her burning desires,
the most perverted ones!
My hunger of opposition appeased,
The lord takes me over and over again...
Fifty infernal breeds, I had to ride the third strike.

So much pain will be given... so much... so much!!!
By my dark glorious soul,
By dark glorious thoughts,
my soul will be fulfiled of strength again...

By dark glorious thoughts!!!"

Got some celebrating planned

I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Stem on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Cast the line, check the fuse
save some time, this ain't no pleasure cruise

Tell the captain not to take too long
Keep that big wheel turning fast and strong
Fires are burning down below
Come on steamboat don't be slow

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Wind the springs, set the course
Pull some strings before I turn to force

Dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Ring the bell, sound the horn
Move like hell, I'm heading back where I was born

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride

Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

Me and my self-denial will keep you from justice and free

I wriggle and squirm as you try to convince me
And everyone stares, they know what I've been up to
The pressure engulfing me, memories orbiting me
Fits epiletic in waves leaping over me

No contact of flesh and no tongues and no touching
No fear of disease and I can't take my clothes off
I want to get fucked like a whore in a porno, it's me
Don't tell anybody, it's our dirty secret, it's me

You've intruded and taken away all my sweetness

Somehow these mirrors they make my existence seem bigger"

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks

Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch"

Dying as you purr

I've watched you pass autumn's twilight yearning

Now with dawn I bring you eternal sleep
And silence all forever mourning...

And with dusk's onset... I lay with you...

Frozen blood upon my lips..."

blowing differently than ever before
and they're pushing me further from shore

a frothy cap the steady slap
of lines against the rail
a biting rain take in the main

Time to overthrow the state
Time to demand all my beliefs are in a new constitution
I can't stop you from cryin'
But sometimes I can lick away your tears

If you look in someone's eyes
More than two seconds now
You better be prepared to fight
I got too much fear
And too much neglect of magical things

I am rolling from you
You are rolling from me
We are rolling away

I caught a cold and for two days straight
My ears have been plugged up
As if my body's saying,
""You don't need your ears
You don't listen anyway.""

We need more hair relaxers
More magazine's tellin us there's something wrong with your face
There's something wrong with your face

There's something wring with your face

I gave him the keys and now he's stompin' through the house
He has a very busy itinerary
He does not have time for you

We did everything 'cept fight
We used to fight so good

And I want to write 'em all a great one

I'd love to trade places with a dog for a day
To know what he thinks and what he feels
Does he think about life?
Does he think about God?
Or just about his next meal like us?

So often these days eating Indian food
Passes for spirituality
I don't meditate
I don't pray
But I eat two somosas every day

Oh, go down Moses, go down on me
I do not have the strength to fight
I only pray you treat me gently
These are long, cold nights

I am rolling from you
You are rolling from me
We are rolling away

I cry every day
But beauty shows up
Where you least expect to find it

I am rolling from you
You are rolling from me
We are rolling away

I am rolling from you
You are rolling from me
We are rolling away

I am rolling from you

our muted calls can't be heard.

Helpless as we stand
amidst the push of thoughtless hands.

in a raging storm on a calm sea.
Clinging to our expectations
to stem the tide of destiny.

Helpless as we fall

I tried not to wake her up as I laid her down
Then I sat there and watched her sleep for a while
I've admired her for so long from far away
If I could hold her in my arms, then maybe she could love me,
If I could only find the words that I want to say

Sullen like a dream that I once had
Made me feel scared and lonely
She'll never know how she got back
What her eyes had shown me
And I close the door and walk away
I close the door and walk away...
But I want to stay...

The leaves below my feet crumbled at my steps
And the sun has risen higher than it was before
I step into my car and I drive for a while
I can't stand the same scenery anymore

I stop along the bridge, and I close my earthly eyes
And I wonder what this world can offer me
Cars they move below me and I seem to realize, and I look
Up at the sky and call her name."

(Roz)
To each his own, I'ma have this known from the door
I make niggaz walk like ball four
Y'all score game down the block, for me it's hip-hop
around the clock, critical I'm bound to drop (stop)
You ain't know I'm nice girl, youse a Wannabe
like the Spice Girls, you betta think twice girl
I'm untry-able, undeniable
Won't be held liable for givin knots that's untie-able
R-O-Z, recognize my name
Rap G.I. Jane rockin colorful wide frames
Straight from Newark we Brick layers, Na Na slayers
Don't play I coach and pick players
in Da Bricks, get your shit popped locked and stolen
Step back I'm holdin, bitches be rollin
Ghetto style, I'ma stay that ripper
Tryin to get cash out the ass like a stripper

(Tame One)
Dub O, I'm down for whateva, do what I gotta to get the chedda
Fuck takin over cities, we conquered galaxies and better
I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin bout you used to rob niggaz with pump shotties
I know you love club music nigga, but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggaz, gettin screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect, I'ma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend
Cause when I'm around you be quiet but when I leave you be talkin again
But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm widdit to brawl with you
Now what if I put your bitch ass in a headlock and fall witchu

	Yo niggaz, shut your windows and close ya doorz
	Comin straight from Da Brick City (2X)

(Young Z)
Yo, here I come
Yo, yeah, yo YEAH (C'mon Z!)
Your bitch said aliens raped her and her four friends
But it was all the Outz, we dressed up as Martians
When I, crack a brew it's nuttin else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggaz can't fuck with Bricks
While you scrubbin dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggaz stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

(Gov-Matic)
Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

(Diezzel Don)
D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin and spendin
Got bitches trickin tryin to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin to cop from me
How many pouns you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggaz know me, for bein low key
That hustler from A.C.

(Gov-Matic)
I'm steady shittin on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
plus I bust glock, on pussies I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block like the toughest nigga from jail home
And you dead gone when my squad come around
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown

	(Chorus)"
138,Hecate Enthroned,The Pagan Swords of Legend,TRHDJZN128F9351902,1998,"Slaying souls, danse macabre
&gt;From within and still unscarred
I stand alone and solemn as thy distant lights frey to death
And all around fore none as demon shall be found
Out beneath the azrael
Tolling raven of the knell

And to my dark angel

Whose form too vast to comprehend
As demons rise and re-ascend
Here is were evenings serenades
Amidst the dawn as gracious slaves

For my words are without sound
Far beyond and well renown
Centuries of dusk in time
Bleeding shadows of thy shrine
Within, thy darkness frey born of kaos in decay
Reaping shadows unto thee
A gracious death for all to see
As infinite avails
The human race that never fails
Played upon thy calming heart
Eyes of terror bleeding hard
That I doth control thee
Leading southward to the key
Hanging from the brances frail
Queen of darkness to unveil

Where whispers charm thy emptiness
And pierce thy tenous membrane
That striketh through my anguished heart
And tainted skys, where once demons remained
As the silent darkness breeding
Winters hate in silouettic sky
Stained with blood of an ancient slumber
With such a passionate melancholy

Of ages past and times to come
Shall speak in sound and slay in tongues
And spirits chanting satans hail
As darkness falls unto thy veil

Between in death thy black spirit
&gt;From thy pain we shall commit
Sleeping shadows demons fray
From beyond in massacre's pain
Fore thou art draped in sin
Amidst the shadows I have been
And seek the silent sentinel
On battlefields where they fell

Desire rekindles thee
Nearer than infinite
The dying scent of fragrant death
Fore spell of winter I possess
That I might dream thy pain
Invoke to tee like dragons slain
A lullaby like song of grave
Caressing shadows, demons slave

Thou alone soth se me in this sorrow

Fore thou art beautiful, fore thou art bright
Flashing thy splendour amidst the midnight
Thou canst not flee, mine shalt thou be
Of all enchantment
Thou shalt a goddess be"
139,No Fun At All,In-sight,TRCHZNZ128F428B06B,1998,"Who's that kid in the back of the room?
Who's that kid in the back of the room?
Getting old, big, thick and tired
Getting old, big, thick and tired
Where did you get that crazy smile?
Where did you get that crazy smile?
We don't think it really cares
We don't think it really cares

We never talked to him
He never looks quite right
He laughs at us and we just beat him up and what he sees escapes our sight
Sight

We never see him with the girls
We never see him with the girls
Rocking too and soured again
Rocking too and soured again
Why does him even the taunts offend?
Why does him even the taunts offend?
Getting forward where we hang around
Getting forward where we hang around

We never talked to him
He never looks quite right
He laughs at us and we just beat him up and what he sees escapes our sight
Sight

We're all tired and out of this
We're all tired and out of this
We're all tired and out of this, in fact we're growing old"

141,Rhett Akins,Drivin' My Life Away,TRDZFRZ128F14965BE,1998,"Well, the midnight headlights blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, making no time
But I gotta keep rolling
Those windshield wipers slapping out a tempo
Keeping perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
Yeah, I gotta keep rolling

Ooh, I'm driving my life away, looking for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away, I'm looking for a sunny day

Well, the truck stop cutie coming on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride, said I wouldn't be sorry
Aw, but she was just a baby
Hey, waitress, pour me another cup of coffee
Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me out, flying down the highway
I'm looking for the morning

Ooh, I'm driving my life away, looking for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away, I'm looking for a sunny day


Well, the midnight headlights blind you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead, slow me down, making no time
Yeah, I gotta keep rolling
Those windshield wipers slapping out a tempo
Keeping perfect rhythm with the song on the radio
Lord, I gotta keep rolling

Ooh, I'm driving my life away, looking for a better way for me
Ooh, I'm driving my life away, just looking for a sunny day
Ooh, I'm driving my life away, I'm looking for a sunny day

143,Carmen Consoli,Eco Di Sirene,TRCTIUU128F92DE868,1998,"Sorde e implacabili sirene
davano il triste annuncio
mentre il tramonto inondava
i viali deserti
gli oscuri presagi
giochi di potere sulla nostra pelle
su quelli uomini armati di romantici ideali
qualunque sia il compenso
non restitura' mai il giusto

saremo pronti a celebrare la vittoria
e brinderemo lietamente sulle nostre rovine
saranno in pochi a riscattarsi dalla poverta'
a rallegrarsi della gloria per quanto infinita

L'eco tagliente di sirene
sulle ferite aperte
aspettavamo impotenti gli attacchi nemici
(e) forse per l'ultima volta
giochi di potere sulla nostra pelle
sulle infanzie sciupate,violentate
irrimediabilmente
chi paghera' per questo
chi ne portera' il segno

saremo pronti a celebrare la vittoria
e brinderemo lietamente sulle nostre rovine
saranno in pochi a riscattarsi dalla poverta'
a rallegrarsi della gloria per quanto infinita
sconfitti e vincenti
ricostruiremo sconfitti e vincenti"
144,Orgy,Social Enemies (Album Version),TRHLJDH12903CA5CC2,1998,"Social weapons that miss
Pretend them to save
Cowards, bastards to shame
Condemned social slaves
Here to save the freaks again you think
And I bet you always will
Here to save the freaks
Again you think
Here, here to save the freaks
Snakes causing the fate
Sadistic and free
Traders, defendants behave
Lieges stay away from me
Saints keep knocking, go home don't sell me mary,
No, no making the crazies well inside you think and I bet you always will

chorus:
Calling us no good you are the social enemies
We change the people day to day
Making us no good you are the social enemies
Changing the people day to day

Agitators talking the show
Messing with heads to be the number one
Smashers battling the hills
Proud of yourselves aren't you
Making the crazies well inside you think and I bet you always will

chorus

Why must we play so bitterly
I'm suffering now the nowhere me
Stop trying to say you fell into this place
So tragic you found the nowhere me
Here to save the freaks
Again you think
Here, here to save the freaks"
145,David Summers,El Mundo Grita,TROSGBY128F4276258,1998,"Hoy me derrumbo... Como un edificio viejo...
Voy dando tumbos... Sin ganas de vivir
Cuando pensaba, que estaba todo hecho...
He perdido para siempre.. El centro de mi...

De todas formas... Algo pude aprender
Aunque no estoy muy seguro... De saber contarlo bien
La gente es extraña... Si no eres como ellos...
Las caras son mas feas... Cuando no hay dinero

El mundo llora, como lloran los niños...
Con lagrimas sucias, con dolor y gritos...
El mundo llora como lloran los niños
Todo el mundo, todo el mundo...

¡¡Grita!!

Bienvenidos todos.. A la soledad
Gastad vuestro dinero... En la linea de la amistad
Intentad subir primero... Y sin dejar pasar
Al show de la justicia y a la maquina de la verdad
Pero unos te dicen que... Eres libre de elegir
Con tu cara de huevo, y tu mano de pedir
Y tu que como todos... Piensas solo en ti
Tu ya nunca gritas... Solo quieres dormir...

El mundo llora, como lloran los niños
Con lágrimas sucias, con dolor y gritos
El mundo llora, como lloran los niños
Todo el mundo, todo el mundo...
Todo el mundo ¡grita!
¡¡Grita!!"
