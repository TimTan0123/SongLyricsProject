1,Shirelles,Soldier Boy,TRCERNU128F92E1921,1962,"Soldier boy
Oh my little soldier boy
I'll be true to you

You were my first love
And you'll be my last love
I will never make you blue
I'll be true to you

In the whole world
You can love but one girl
Let me be the one girl
For I'll be true to you

Wherever you go
My heart will follow
I love you so
I'll be true to you

Take my love with you
To any port or foreign shore
Darling you must feel for sure
And I'll be true to you

And they discovered it's the most, man, 
The day they did it to Please Mr. Postman.

3,Kitty Wells,Lonely Side Of Town,TRPDRHI12903CAAC1A,1962,"You're uptown tonight where all the bright lights glow
Where all the honky tonks with wine and music flow

And I've been walking with these blues since then down
Looking for you on the lonely side of town

I can see the lights of town from where I stand
Now I know you're having fun and holding hand

I knew tonight when you never came around
That you had left me on the lonely side of town

Thought the life they live up there has lured your heart
To where they dance and slip around till after dark

Now the wild life and the pretty girls you found
And you left me on the lonely side of town

I wish I could be uptown with you tonight
For I'm afraid that you found someone new you like

Now I don't want to give away my wedding gown
And be left on the lonely side of town"
4,Ben E. King,Young Boy Blues,TRLFHCR12903CACAAF,1962,"Every time I kiss somebody new, I, uh
Make believe I'm kissing you but, uh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause, uh
My heart know we're still apart and, uh

Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues

I wanna cry when I hear your name, but
If I cry, I feel ashamed, so
I let my pride be my guide and then
I keep those tears inside, so

Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
Since I lost these young boy blues, mmm

Don't know where to go
Don't know what to do
I'm so lonesome and lonely
Since I lost you

Every time I kiss somebody new, I, uh
Make believe I'm kissing you but, uh
I can't kid my aching heart 'cause, uh
My heart know we're still apart and

Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues, mmm
Each night is like a thousand years, oh, oh
I can't lose these young boy blues, mmm

Each night is like a thousand years"
5,Flatt & Scruggs,I'll Be No Man's Wife,TRLHZVD128F9314CF6,1962,"One night as I rambled down by the sea shore
And wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard a fair maiden make a pityful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around
I never will marry I'll be no mas's wife
I accept to live single all the days of my life
[ dobro ]
My love's gone and left me the one I adore
He's gone where I never will see him no more
The shells in the ocean shall be my dead bed
A fish in deep water swim over my head
Then she plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her blue eyes in the waters to sleep
I never will marry..."
6,Roy Orbison,Crying,TRPWQUO12903CD9A5A,1962,"I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
Oh, you wished me well
You couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you
Crying over you
When you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But, darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you
Crying over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Yeah, crying
Crying
Over you"
7,Willie Nelson,Funny How Time Slips Away,TRGHNTF128F4274826,1962,"Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny how time slips away?

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Now, that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny how time slips away?

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know, when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
In time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips away"
8,Tony Bennett,The Best Is Yet To Come,TRWFSDD128F42B12FA,1962,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, and babe, won't it be fine
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come, and babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come, and babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine, ho-ho,
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum..."
9,Johnny Mathis,Misty,TRQZWCU12903CE8FCD,1962,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hoplessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty and too much in love
(repeat after music interlude)

Look at me"
10,Howlin' Wolf,Evil,TRXJMPO12903CD8698,1962,"If you're a long way from home, can't sleep at night
Grab your telephone, something just ain't right
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home

Well, long way from home and, can't sleep at all
You know another mule is, kickin' in your stall
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home

""You better catch him, 'cause somethin's wrong, in your home""

Well, if ya call her on the telephone, and she answers awful slow
Grab the first train smokin', if you have to hobo
That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong
I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home

If you make it to your house, knock on the front door
Run around to the back, you'll catch him, just before he go
That's evil, evil is goin' on
I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home"

12,Howlin' Wolf,I'm Leavin' You,TRNVXUA12903CCC46B,1962,"Well maybe in the mornin', I don't know
Baby don't know, just how soon
But I'm leavin' you
Woman I've got to put you down
Well if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around

Well you told me that you love me
You cross your heart to die
But I found out that wasn't so
I'm leavin' you
Woman I got to put you down
Girl if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around

Well early in the mornin' before I rise
You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes
You's a mean little thing, meanest woman I ever seen
No matter how I try to treat you right
Still you's a mean little thing

Well you told me that you love me
You cross your heart to die
But I found out, baby, bye bye
I'm leavin'
Woman I got to put you down
Well if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around

Well early in the morning before I rise
You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes
You's a mean little thing
Mean little thing as you can be
Well if you can't treat me right
Still you's a mean little thing

I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'"

Please put a penny in the old man's hat
Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat
Please put a penny in the old man's hat

If you haven't got a ha' penny, then God bless you"
14,Aretha Franklin,Nobody Like You,TRBHAFL128F4283DB2,1962,"I've looked around all over town
And I'm so lonely and so blue
I've looked around and all over
But I can't find nobody like you, you, you, yeah

Now, it's all so lonely since you went away
And I don't know what to do
I've looked around all over, over
I just can't find nobody, nobody like you

Tears seem to fall when I'm away, oh, when I'm away from you
And I've tried to understand the reason why
And now I know it's all, it's all because I love you, I love you so much
My heart is yours until the day that I die

And oh, why don't you hold me
Hold me and never, never let me go?
Why don't you, why don't you love me, love me
And vanish all thoughts of sorrow?
I love you, I love you, just can't find nobody like you"

That a-you were fooling me

They say that our love won't grow
But I just wanna tell them

That they don't know-oh-ho

For as long
As you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea

And of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
That you'll be my girl

And woo-ooo-ooo

Wanting you

16,Mary Wells,You Beat Me To The Punch,TROHKGP128F1474B33,1962,"That day, I first saw you,whoa whoa, passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was just too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name
You beat me to the punch, that time
You beat me to the punch oh,oh,oh,oh
You beat  me to the punch

Whoa, after I hadn't known you for it seemed like a long,long time
I wanted,wanted to ask you would you please,please be mine
Whenever you came around,my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours
You beat me to the punch one more time
You beat me to the punch oh,oh,oh,oh
You beat me to the punch, yeah

Since I love you I thought you would be true 
And love me tender, so I let my heart surrender 
To you, yes I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day boy,you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day
And beat you to the punch
Yes I will  and  let you know how it feels, oh,oh,oh"

I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised

Your mother says that I'm a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise, darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore

Through this open world, I'm about to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm about to ride that mornin' railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I'm going back to Colorado
The place that I started from

21,Claude King,Wolverton Mountain,TRTSGVT128F421808A,1962,"They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey and Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he might take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain it's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter from the one who loves her so
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...
And I don't care about Clifron Clovers I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love I don't care about Clifron Clovers
I'm gonna climb up on that mountain and I'll get the one I love"

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love"

Pretending out loud but it don't seem the same 
For the heart of the crowd is gone from sight 
My part of the crowd is not with me tonight 

I remember the FUN, every dance with you 
All the crazy things that we used to do 
Sometimes we'd wait for a chance 
And then we'd steal away 
From the crowd and the dance to our hideaway 

Aww, but you're gone and it's not the same old game 
I fall apart each time I hear your name 
Guess I'll go along with the crowd, I'll make believe 
That you'll come back to me, run back to me 
Hurry back to the crow-ow-ow-owd a-and me-e-e-e-e."

Mashed potatoes
Slow alligator
Twist the twister
Like little sister
Do you get the Yoyo
The endless gogo
Do you do the fish
Goes like this
Do you do the tango
Takes two to tango
Get down on your knees
Do the sweet peas
Roll over on your back
Say I like it like that
Do the watussi
Do the watussi
Can you do the fly
With a hand jive
Do you do the slot
Shakin' in a bop
Then you go home
So you won't be all alone
So bye bye children
Bye bye children
Come on with me children
Lets go children
I wanna show you
This little place
Across the track
The name of the place
I'll like it like that
The name of the band
The fat men
Lets go children
The fat men
Lets go children"

About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and try to get a date
My boss says, ""No dice son, you gotta work late""
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and pop told me, ""Son you gotta make some money""
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
""Well you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick""
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my congressman and he said ""Whoa!""
""I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote""
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do

I'll send you all my dreams 
Everyday in a letter 
Sealed with a kiss 

I'll see you in the sunlight 
I'll hear your voice everywhere 
I'll run to tenderly hold you 
But, Darlin' you won't be there 

I don't wanna say good-bye for the summer 
Knowing the love we'll miss 
So let us make a pledge 
To meet in September 
And seal it with a kiss

And take the brightest stars up in the skies 
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Long before this old world ever heard of me

It will hurt me so much to see you go

And though I still love you as before
I'm just one step beyond carin' any more

Guess that you're surprised that I could feel this way
After stayin' home and waitin' night and day
For someone who cared so much for me
You'd come home just long enough to laugh at me

To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best

The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it 'cause you've just gotta ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
The heavies at the pipeline are okay
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

You were with a guy named Joe
And all at once he said you had to go.

Here, there, everywhere for you
Because I have cried for you

Held annually, once a year, along the River Thames,
The scene was quiet and peaceful, the snow lay on the ground
The Cockneys by their cooking pots were huddled all around.
The chief was in his tepee his face all lined with wrinkles
When up the river came the cry
""someone's pinched me winkles!""
Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched,
Now some people say it's a load of old nonsense but a winkle's got a lot of vitamin contents
Never win that race tomorrow I'll be a big disgrace tomorrow
I'll search the blinking place tomorrow, but tomorrow is too late
Some rotter's pinched me winkles off me plate.
(I turned round and wheeeet, they were gone)

The tears of sheer frustration started trickling down his face, well
He'd set his heart on winning in the gruelling barrow race,
Without his final winkle feed his training scheme was shot
He staggered round the camp ground shouting ""someone's pinched the lot""

Me winkles have been pinched (oobie dooby) me winkles have been pinched
Beef or carrots or a dash of cucumber
As far as I'm concerned that's a load of old lumber
I'll never win the race tomorrow, he's got me in disgrace tomorrow
He'd better not show his face tomorrow, he'll end up in a fight
But me I need them winkles here tonight.
(now I want 'em, now, not tomorrow or the next day)

They called the wise old medicine man who shuffled up and said
""I'm levying a winkle tax one winkle each per head""
They made a grand collection from every tucker pot
Then stood around, the shells and all, they made me eat the lot

I've got me winkles back (oobie dooby) I've got me winkles back
Now I know I've been grumping and grousing
But I never thought I'd get two or three thousand
I'll never win that race tomorrow, I can't go in that race tomorrow
I couldn't stand the pace tomorrow, I'm much to blinking fat
I'll never face a winkle after that.
Phew - I think I'll go and try out something new, you know, just to see how it feels
I think I'll have a dash at some jellied eels.

(Excuse me a minute while I just get this newspaper off this bit of jellied eel here).
Mmm - that's lovely;
Here, you with the winkle barrow, ""hello""
as far as I'm concerned you can stick your perishing winkles right... back in the sea
- it's jellied eels for me."

yo me encuentro mas alto
mas alto que el sol
mientras el mundo se aleja despacio
despacio de mi
una musica dulce tocada
solo para mi

Volare oh oh 
Cantare oh oh oh oh
Nel blu di pinto di blu
felice di stare lassu"

They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be

These arms of mine

Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be

Come on, come on, baby
Just be my little woman
Just be my lover, oh
I need me somebody
Somebody to treat me right
Oh, I need your warm, loving arms to hold me tight
And I, I, I need, I need your, I need your tender lips too, oh
Hold me
Tell me when I'm lyin'

I shift my course along the breeze
Won't sail upwind on memories

Just runnin' scared, afraid to lose

So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be
You turned around and walked away with me"

When somebody breaks your heart -
Some, Somebody twice as smart as I -
A somebody who would swear to be true,
As you used to do with me -
Who'll leave you to learn,
That misery loves company -
Wait and see.

I mean I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits -
Let's see if that puzzle really fits, so fine -
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet,
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat -
When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine.

When somebody breaks your heart just like you
Broke mine -
Oh yeah.

Then...

That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet.
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat -
Somebody breaks your heart, Yes, Like you broke
Mine -
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke
Mine -
Oh yeah."
57,Harry Belafonte,I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day,TRSMGSF128F930FE02,1962,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet 
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men

I thought, as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long 
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail
The right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men"
58,Pink Anderson,In The Jailhouse Now,TRKUIGZ128F93120AE,1962,"I had an old friend name Campbell
Campbell used to steal and gamble
Made his living cheating all the while (yessir)
Had a little game he called euchre
Blackjack dice and poker
Thought he was the smartest dude in town

But I just found out Monday
Campbell got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse down in town
They got Campbell in the jail
No one to go his bail
That judge he won't accept no fine (they got'm)

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told Campbell once or twice
Stop playing cards and shooting dice
He's up on Broad Street now
(he's hardheaded, pay nobody no mind but they got'm)

I remember last election
When the white folks was in action
Trying to get thyself a president
A colored man by the name of Bill Austin
Walked from New York to Boston
Just to find a colored sentiment

Now my brother Bill's a voter
Bill's a great promoter
Always looking for some good advice
So they told Bill to go to the polls
And vote?
Instead of voting once the fool voted twice (that settled it)

He's on the rock pile now
He's on the rock pile now
I told Bill to stay at home
And let other people's business alone
He's down in Woodruff now
(Hardheaded you know, wouldn't pay nobody no mind 
but they got to put him somewhere He ain't like me)

I walked up to town on Friday
I met a girl named Ida
I thought she was the prettiest girl in town (mmmmm)
She began to call me honey
And I began to spend all my money
We walked into a swell café and set down

Folks, I made sure I were in it
I was spending every minute
Buying white whiskey home brew and wine everything by the quart
But when I went to pay that man
I found that lady's hand
In my pocket where my money was (that settled it)

She's in the graveyard now
She's in the graveyard now
I told the judge to his face
That woman's hand was out of place
She's in the ape yard now"

Cold ground was my bed last night, rocks was my pillow too
I woke up this morning, I'm wondering, what in the world am I gonna do?

I lay down thinking, buy me a mojo hand
I lay down thinking, buy me a mojo hand
I did wanna fix my woman so she can't have no other man

But don't let your woman fix you like mine fixed me
Don't let your woman, boy, fix you like mine fixed me

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you"

The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me"

If that guy's got into your blood, go out and get him
If you want him to be the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe, here's the thing to do

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now

I know something about love. You gotta show it and make him
See the moon up above. Reach out and get it
If you want him to make your heart sing out
And if you want him to only think of you

Ever since the world began it's been that way
For man and woman were created to make love their destiny
Then why should true love be so complicated? Oh

I know something about love. You gotta take it and
Show him what the world is made of, one kiss will prove it
If you want him to be always by your side
Take his hand tonight and swallow your foolish pride and
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always gonna love him . . ."

I said, the sheep with curly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn

I said, the dove from the rafters high
I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry

From the bottom of my soul
Hey, hey

Now that she's older
You're old enough to know
Hey, hey

You want to leave
You want to let me go
Hey, hey

I want you to know
Girl, I want you to know right now
You've been good to me, baby
Better than I've been to myself, hey, hey

And if you ever leave me
I don't want nobody else, hey, hey
I said I want you to know
Girl, I want you to know right now

You know you make me wanna, come on now
(Shout, shout)
Come on now, come on now
(Shout, shout)

Come on now, come on now

Hear me shout now, come on and shout
(Shout, shout)
Hear me shout now"
106,Mary Wells,The One Who Really Loves You,TRKCOSS128F93227CA,1962,"Some other girls are filling your head with jive
So, now you're acting like you don't know I'm alive

Love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you

Suzie, only wants you until the day
(Only wants you until the day)
That she'll again have her true love
Who's far, far, away
(Her true love who's far away)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Ginny only wants you,
'Cause she thinks she has to have everyone
Minnie, only wants you
'Cause she thinks that hurting me would be fun
Oh, oh, oh

Silly Lilly, you know she doesn't really
Want you with a love that's true
In fact, there's no other girl
In this whole wide world
Who can love you like I do

They get tired of you
Then they're gonna put ya down
(Put you down, put you down)
They ain't gonna want you hangin' around
(Hangin' around, hangin' around)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up

107,Shirley Bassey,You'll Never Walk Alone,TRXPBNE128F1461738,1962,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone"
108,Jim Reeves,There's Always Me,TRBNZCU128F428D7BB,1962,"When the evening shadows fall
And your wondering who to call
For a little company, there's always me
Or if your great romance should end
And you're lonesome for a friend
Darling, you need never be, there's always me.

I don't seem to mind somehow
Playing second fiddle now
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here.

Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be eternally
Look around and you will see, there's always me..."
109,Charlie Drake,My Boomerang Won't Come Back,TRGGTXN128F4299AD2,1962,"Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka

In the bad back lands of Australia
Many years ago
The aborigine tribes were meeting
Having a big pow-wow

Oom, yacka, wurka
Oom, yacka, wurka

We got a lot of trouble, Chief
On account of your son Mack
My boy Mack? Why, what's wrong with him?
My boomerang won't come back
Your boomerang won't come back?

My boomerang won't come back
My boomerang won't come back
I've waved the thing all over the place
Practiced till I was black in the face
I'm a big disgrace to the Aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

I can ride a kangaroo
(Yeah, yeah)
Make Kinkajou stew
(Yeah, yeah)
But I'm a big disgrace to the aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

They banished him from the tribe then
And sent him on his way
He had a backless boomerang
So here he could not stay

This is nice, innit? Getting banished at my time of life
What a way to spend an evening
Sitting on a rock in the middle of the desert
With me boomerang in me hand
I shall very likely get bushwhacked

Get out of it, you nasty bushwhacking animal
Think I'll make a nice cup of tea
(Doing, doing, doing)
Good gracious, there goes a kangaroo
I must have a practice with me boomerang
Hit him right behind the left ear hole
Now then, slowly back

If you throw that thing at me
I'll jump right on your head
(It chuckles and bounces away)
Innit marvelous?
Got a land full of kangaroos
And I had to pick that one

For three long months he sat there
Or maybe it was four
Then an old old man in a kangaroo skin
Came a-knocking at his door

Well, I'm the local witch doctor, son
They call me George Alfred Black
Now tell me, what's your trouble, boy?
My boomerang won't come back
Your boomerang won't come back?

My boomerang won't come back
My boomerang won't come back
I've waved the thing all over the place
Practiced till I was black in the face
I'm a big disgrace to the aborigine race
My boomerang won't come back

Don't worry, boy, I know the trick
And to you I'm gonna show it
If you want your boomerang to come back
Well, first you've got to throw it

Ooh, yes, never thought of that
Daddy will be pleased
Must have a go, nyuh, huh, excuse me
Now then, slowly back and throw

Ooh my God, I've hit the flying doctor
Eee, hee, hee, can you do first aid?
Don't talk to me about first aid
Boy, you owe me fourteen chickens

You know, when I learned you to throw the boomerang
You know, first things first
Yes, I know that but I mean
I think on this occasion, you know
You could be a bit more constructive"
