0,Teresa Brewer,Let Me Go Lover,TRSAFIR128F92FAEFA,1992,"Let me go, let me go, let me go
 
Oh, let me go
Let me go
Let me go, lover
Let me be
Set me free
From your spell
 
You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed
From the first
Day I fell
 
You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through
 
Please turn me loose
What's the use?
Let me go, lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
 
You made me weep
Cut me deep
I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed
From the first
Day I fell
 
You don't want me
But you want me
To go on wanting you
Now I pray that
You will say that
We're through
 
Please turn me loose
What's the use?
Let me go, lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go"
1,Porcupine Tree,Voyage 34,TRTNSZE128F4270DB5,1992,"Spoken:

This remarkable, sometimes incoherent transcript illustrates a phantasmagoria of fear, terror, grief, exaltation and finally breakdown. Its highlights have been compressed on this recording to make their own disquieting points.

The time is 9.30 PM, one hour after the participants have eaten sugar cubes saturated with LSD. We hear Brian and his fellow travellers observing their gradual transformation.

Brian's been amusing his friends by chewing on some plastic flashbulbs.

Brian's mood is gradually changing. He orders all of his friends into another room and closes the door.
He sits alone on the wooden floor, visible only by the dim light shining from the bathroom. He talks to himself.

The time is now 1 AM. Brian is unable to snap his fingers and terminate the trip, which continues.

He sobs, as his joy turns to fear.

Brian's rocky journey ended twelve hours after it so innocently had begun. He was shattered by it.

This young man never had a bummer in some thirty-three LSD trips. Every one of them was a delight. Everything under control. He needed only to snap his fingers and down he came, any time. But on Voyage 34 he finally met himself coming down an up-staircase, and the encounter was crushing."
2,The Bongos,Tiger Nights,TRMFXFE128F42608B0,1992,"Tiger, tiger
There are some things
I dream about
In the bushes
Hidden kisses
You turn around
And I see you
Wearing something
Striped in black

Well live
Just like a tiger
And do what we want when we do
Well love,
And then our dreams of the kill will come true

Winds of passion
This is something
I've dreamed about
And tonight I'm
Gonna tell you
What I've cried about
Deep inside me
There is something burning bright for you
Tiger, tiger
In the bushes
Gonna wait for you

And then well love
Just like a tiger!
Our friends they will call on the phone
And well long
For what the jungle has taken away

Well love
Just like a tiger
And do what we want when we do
Well fight
And then our dreams of the kill will come true"
3,Neon 2,Kemiaa,TRVVTUH128F425F1D7,1992,"Sen illan puistossa me istuttiin
Yömyöhään juteltiin
Puiston hämärässä suudeltiin (mmm)
Viiniä nautittiin
Sä kerroit kuinka mukavaa
Ois kantaa sormusta
Pieni mökki metsän laitaan laittaa
Kukkia kasvattaa

Mut hei ei se riitä
Et on mukavaa
Sen täytyy olla paljon parempaa

Siinä täytyy olla rakkautta
Siinä täytyy olla unelmii
Mannapuuroa ja mansikkaa
Juuri oikeenlaista kemiaa
Sen täytyy joskus satuttaa
Sen täytyy voida naurattaa
Ei siitä muuten mitään tuliskaan
Ilman oikeenlaista kemiaa

Alkoi katuvalot sammumaan
Ja meitä paleltaa
Sä pyysit mua vierees nukkumaan
Joo, mä olin valmiina
Aamuyöstä vielä kuuden aikaan
Kuuntelin haaveitas
Seinän takaa isäs kuorsausta
Hmm.. mä taisin huokaista

Mut hei ei se riitä
Et on mukavaa
Sen täytyy olla paljon parempaa

Siinä täytyy olla rakkautta
Siinä täytyy olla unelmii
Mannapuuroa ja mansikkaa
Juuri oikeenlaista kemiaa
Sen täytyy joskus satuttaa
Sen täytyy voida naurattaa
Ei siitä muuten mitään tuliskaan
Ilman oikeenlaista kemiaa

Ei elämää liikaa suunnitella saa
Antaa sen mennä vain painollaan
Jos joskus vielä tavataan - hyvä niin
Jos ei - lakit päähän ja näkemiin

Mut hei ei se riitä
Et on mukavaa
Sen täytyy olla paljon parempaa

Siinä täytyy olla rakkautta
Siinä täytyy olla unelmii
Mannapuuroa ja mansikkaa
Juuri oikeenlaista kemiaa
Sen täytyy joskus satuttaa
Sen täytyy voida naurattaa
Ei siitä muuten mitään tuliskaan
Ilman oikeenlaista kemiaa"
4,Take That,Why Can't I Wake Up With You,TRTSAJR128F42BBC09,1992,"Oh, I can't decide
If I should read or think
I'll keep an open mind
Till the day sets in
I hear you call me ( hear you call me, you call me)
I'm so willing to call back ( willing to call back)
Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too

Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life

Oh, I feel alive
So I'll just begin
To read my mind
Before you ring me
Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too

Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life

So good to be near you (so good to be near you)
So dark when you walk from my side
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life (you're my life)

Hear you thinking
Hope you hear me thinking too

Why can't I wake up with you
So you're there when I open my eyes (there when I open my eyes)
Baby why can't I wake up with you
You're my life

Why don't we dream the same night
So you're there when the dark turns to light
Baby I know this is right
You're my life"
5,Bolt Thrower,This Time Its War,TRZDYNK12903CDF12A,1992,"Intimidation you can't take much more,
No compromise - tis time its war.
Take none alive - their battle cry roars,
Nowhwre to hide - this time its war.
Face the fear that grips your mind,
The final conflict - the end of mankind.
Read the hatred deep witin their eyes.
It's your time to die you now realise.
What has occured to man,
Just isn't how you planned,

Enslaved by machinery,
Submit to technology:
Our future lives - Mankinds entity,
Lies in our hands - Together we must face reality.
A ruined world of lost identity,
Technological supremacy."
6,After 7,Takin' My Time,TRKCDTZ128F931EDBA,1992,"You blow my mind, with the things you do to me
Girlie I can't resist your luscious lips caressing my body

How do you keep not from fallin
Fallin in love, with a girl that can do you
The way you like to be done

You blow my mind with the things you do to me girlie I cant resist your
Luscious lips caressing my body

Takin my time with you girl
Never know when we'll do this again
Takin my time with you girl,
Touchin your love stokin you from within (hook)



I hear your voice callin
(baby please pick up the phone)
But I don't wanna answer
I got too many women
So I'm tellin you not to fall in love with me

Repeat hook 3x

The time is right for you to be
Close to me
Indefinately
They say good things come to those
Who wait I need to hold you in my arms"
7,Foo Fighters,I'll Stick Around,TRFEVKY128F4289414,1992,"I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true
That you'll see
How could it be, I'm the only one who sees
Your rehearsed insanity, yeah

I still refuse all the methods you abused
It's alright if you're confused
Let me be
I've been around all the pawns you gagged and bound
They'll come back and knock you down
And I'll be free

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure

I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything

I had no hand in your ever-desperate plan
It returns and when it lands
Words are due
I should have known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown
You were too

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure

I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything

I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
Learn from all that came from it

8,Los Lobos,That Train Don't Stop Here,TRMAZQR128F146EEEC,1992,"Looking out my window
I see my world has changed
The sun won't rise this mornin'
'Cause my baby's gone away

Yesterday I could tell myself
That she'd be back for sure
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore

She used to go out with the girls
Every now and then
She always came home early
We'd jump in bed by ten
She'd tell me that she loved me
She would forevermore
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, alright

Nothin' changes faster than baby's fickle mind
I know she's lovin' someone
Somewhere down the line
I know that she still has a key
I'm waiting by the door
But that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, alright

She ran out through the back door
Screamin' in the night
She said I was the devil
I didn't treat her right
That man down at the station
Said ""That was her for sure""
Now that train don't stop here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, ah shucks"
9,Neneh Cherry,Twisted,TRDKXPI128F429DF41,1992,"I think I could give myself up to you
Cause you pushed your way thru my attitude
But a taste of life on the tip of my tongue
Won't let me forget. It just reminds me
Of all the things I've been fed
And all the magazines that I've read
I'm suspicious of what you said

How long can we be this way
How long can we live this way
Will twisted tongues bring us down
Or the twisted world we're living in
Or am I the one that's twisted too
Thinking we'll make it thru

Lipstick smiles bring me worries
When I imagine you with somebody else
That's when I know you got me twisted baby
Oh these wicked jealousies could bring us down 
Every woman to herself
Every man is his own
When I'm with you the feeling's stronger
I wonder

How Long can we be this way
How long can we live this way... 

The thought of saying I'll give you everything I got
Seems so empty cause it's stereotype
To protect my sanity

How Long can we be this way
How long can we live this way..."
10,Faith No More,Midlife Crisis,TRQRUTM128F1482512,1992,"Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius
My head is like lettuce
Go on, dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop givin'
I'm thirty-something

Sense of security
Like pockets jinglin'
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree

You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two
It's a midlife crisis
It's a midlife crisis

What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex
Morbid self-attention
Bending my pinky back
A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion

Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I'm a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee

You're perfect, yes, it's true
But without me you're only you (you're only you)
Your menstruating heart
It ain't bleedin' enough for two

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Ahhhh!

11,SWV,Weak,TRQJHBI128F93456CA,1992,"I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you do to me
It's a feeling that I don't understand

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

Time after time after time I try to fight it
Your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, cries fading
In your condition I don't want to be alone

'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you, oh

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it
Your love so sweet
Knocks me off my feet

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't explain why your loving makes me weak

I get so weak
Blood starts racing through my veins
I get so weak
Boy it's something I can't explain

I get so weak
Something 'bout the way ya do the things you do it
Knocks me right off of my feet, oh
I can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes hold of me
In a daze, you look so amazing
It's not a phase, I need you to stay with me

You're my angel 
You're the girl of my dreams

For waiting patiently
Daddy's home-Daddy's home -To stay

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home- Daddy's Home-To stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon

But I made a promise
That you treasure
And I made it back to you

I cried Lord please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no more
Yeah, I cried Lord please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no more
I was out my window, come back baby, please don't go

I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand
I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand, yeah
I heard her tell her mother, that golfer was no good man, yeah

Watch out, watch out

Well, I was fine baby, leave her, mother held by the hand

pioggia sarò
e pioggia tu sarai

x mano insieme a camminare
domenica.

Aspetterò che aprano i vinai
più grande ti sembrerò
e tu più grande sarai
nuove distanze
ci riavvicineranno
dall'alto di un cielo, Diamante,
i nostri occhi vedranno.

Passare insieme soldati e spose
ballare piano in controluce
moltiplicare la nostra voce
x mano insieme soldati e spose.
Domenica, Domenica

Fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono
fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono
fai piano i bimbi grandi non piangono

Passare insieme soldati e spose
ballare piano in controluce
moltiplicare la nostra voce
passare in pace soldati e spose.

15,Saigon Kick,Hostile Youth (LP Version),TRSZSGU128F4230E23,1992,"I can feel you now deep inside of me.
I was blind but now all the pain I see.
We don't like our homes. 
It's nothing but a joke.
We won't do what we're told.
Leave us all alone.
God is dead, you see.
All you need is me.


Kill off those who deny.
You are king tonight.
I can feel you falling faster.
Your life is on the wall.
No more laughter, no more rules.
Catch me if I fall."
16,311,Plain,TRVZBCB128F9314883,1992,"I'm in a good way on a bad day.
Thinking of a plan a way to stay on top of it.
Nailin' in it. I have a fit if I sit, sit doin' nothin'.
Which is what I done so far but I carve a niche
which sits in my good things brain.
Layin' the tracks like a loco mo, spark the Jay.

Chorus :
Tabla Rosa is my brain don't mean to bug or drive you insane.
Don't have to guess just, just what I'm sayin if I had a point I'd say it plain.
Oh, dammit, huh, my brain is blank, huh
and now I say, it would be a lie if I said I was inspired
nothin' to say but that's ok..

Nod your head to this.

Messin' around, I'm not having it.
You bite the hand I put your head out.
I come to know a travesty, it's so sad to see
The scene dictated by the frustrated former musicians
Switchin' the emphasis from art to money.
But I demand autonomy what else, huh,
I tell you what's wrong to me, the industry's ability to manufacture stars.
They churn them out like Iwojima makes cars.
But the blame lies not with those suits for trying.
It's the sheep, that keep on buying that souless crap,
Whatever they put in front of ya.
The hysteria of America.

Nod your head to this.

Well, stress is the enemy, and not a friend to me.
One thing I see is to be easy goin', throwin' down, sit back
And watch my life flowin' and knowing life is but a dream.
You can ask my home team.
And yeah, uh let me tell you how I seem.
My economy seems to be in words not action, actually, ya see, yes.
I'm a tempest and I rarely rest but that's what you got to do
If you want to be the best so, I'm on the threshold, so don't tell me no.
I just flow and know I can count on my bros.

To this, to this!

Don't you know that the devil he's in me and God She is too.
My Yin hates my Yang, but what the hell ya gonna do.
I choose a rocky ass path but that's how I like it.
Life's a bowl of punch go ahead and spike it."

A frozen shadow in the street
Surrounded by silence and unspoken terror
Hell on high heels

Demonic hunger, a mistress from the grave
""Welcome"", she smiles
The poisoned smell of her sexuality
Says: ""Love me to death""

I can't resist the fear
Her deadly demands
Desires of the flesh
What she commands

I cannot move, I cannot run, I cannot hide
Hypnotized like a fool
Eyes of floating coal and dancing firelight
Oh, hell's own delight

She has got me engulfed by her nature
A slave under her will
In her grasp she is boiling my blood
Just in for the kill

I can't resist the fear
Her deadly demands
Desires of the flesh
What she commands

Black eyes, the crystals of fire are calling my soul
Black eyes, the burning desire is taking control
Black eyes, the crystals of fire are calling my soul
Black eyes, the burning desire is taking control

Oh no, what can I do. Can't resist... those black eyes

Betracht' ich still mir seine Orden,
Dann wird mir manches clearer.

Monarchy now, alive

Durfte im schlimmsten Fall ich wählen
Zwischen monströsen oder dekadenten Seelen
Zwischen Reichsstandarte und
Schönbrunner Flieder
Dar wär' der Kronprinz mir noch lieber
Der hat zwar nie sein Reich besessen,
Dafür a Unzahl von Mätressen.
Das blieb auch so in jedem Fall
In dem Punkt -
Da wär' er liberal.

That glides across the sky
He sings the clearest melody
It makes me want to cry
It makes me want to sit right down
And cry, cry, cry
I walk along the city streets
So dark with rage and fear
And I, I wish that I could be that bird
And fly away from here
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here
But my, my I feel so low
My, my, where do I go?
My, my, what do I know?
My, my, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best but
This little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
I've just got to put these wings to test
For I am just a troubled soul
Who's weighted...
Weighted to the ground
Give me the strength to carry on
Till I can lay this burden down
Give me the strength to lay this burden down
Down, down, yeah
Give me the strength to lay it down
But now, now I feel so low
now, now, where do I go?
now, now, what do I know?
now, now, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best but
This little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
I've just got to put these wings to test"
22,Shawn Colvin,Monopoly,TRPQKSJ128F42648EC,1992,"I don't know what else to do
I would rather do anything
Than write this song for you
And perpetuate this thing
In my head, in my living room
With the usual arsenal
Of broken chords and rusty strings
To surrender all


And I don't like to be so weak
Retreating behind these lines
The same old tongue-in-cheek
Regretting that both are mine
And I don't like to live this way
This is really true
But I know better than to pray now
About what I just have to learn to do
But imagine the nerve of God
Letting me let you in
And I thought I could let you go in grace
I've gotta think again


Because right now I would be bought and sold
To see your face somewhere
I would sell your sweet soul
Just to touch your crazy black gold hair
I don't care what's really real
I was someone that you'd heard of
I saw heaven in your eyes
And we made a deal
And that's what I know of love


Music, it never goes
But I told you I hate that shit
When people say ""well you know you got a song out of it""
But I don't know what else to do
I would rather be anywhere
Than here without you"

(I reminisce, I reminisce) x3
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

Verse one:

[cl]

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of october
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen's risin a chapter
Deja vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my god

[pete rock]

My god
It's so...
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete rock &amp; cl smooth comin' atcha...

Verse two:

[cl]

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand poppa doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the portugese lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good god, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

[pete rock]

For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha...
In '92
Pete rock &amp; cl smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

Verse three:

[cl]

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the r-uh-o-y, how did you and I meet? 
In front of big lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom pam holds the family together
My uncle doc's the greatest better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, uncle sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my aunt joyce
So pete rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

[pete rock]

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble t-roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete rock and cl smooth for '92
And we out, later"
24,Mark Heard,Treasure Of The Broken Land,TRRFMUC128F9345306,1992,"I see you, now and then, in dreams; your voice sounds just like it used to,
I know you better than I knew you then, all I can say is, “I love you,”
I thought our days were commonplace; thought they’d number in the millions,
Now there’s only the aftertaste of circumstance that can’t pass this way again.

Treasure of the broken land,
Parched earth, give up your captive ones,
Waiting wind of Gabriel, blow soon upon the hollow bones.

I saw the city at its tortured worst, and you were outside the walls there,
You were relieved of a lifelong thirst, I was dry at the fountain,
Knew that you could see my shame, but you were eyeless and sparing,
I awoke when you called my name, I felt the curtain tearing.

Treasure of the broken land,
Parched earth, give up your captive ones,
Waiting wind of Gabriel, blow soon upon the hollow bones.

I could melt the clock hands down, but only in my memory,
Nobody gets a second chance to be the friend they meant to be,
I see you now and then in dreams; your voice sounds just like it used to,
I believe I will hear it again,
God, how I love you.

Treasure of the broken land,
Parched earth, give up your captive ones,
Waiting wind of Gabriel, blow soon upon the hollow bones,
Treasure of the broken land,
Parched earth, give up your captive ones,
Waiting wind of Gabriel, blow soon upon the hollow bones,
Yeah, blow soon upon the hollow bones."

You look through the keyhole
This is the hall of heads
One step through the doorway

Roll out that special head
This is our favorite one
Please don't try to leave
Don't leave the hall of heads

Hide underneath the porch
Hide down behind the furnace
You can't get away
You can't really hide
Once you hear the call

Your feet won't help you run
You can't run away

And carry me off into the skyline

Before my angel is gone 
Looking for my blue angel 
The same one that flew from my arms last night 
If you see my blue angel 
Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight 

Last night when she left I told myself 
That she wouldn't go too far 


Now I'm not so sure how long her tears 
Could last in a stranger's arms 
She's wounded I know and feeling so low 
She could fall at anytime 
I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose 
That precious angel of mine

But somewhere there's a little child locked up inside your alybi's.
So take a bow for what you've done.

Freedom

They light the sky. So many die for what they see is wrong or right.

Your world it seems a puzzle piece. So close but we never see.
Life goes by but the pain you'll never see from the scars your world has put on me.
Our statue reads the words of peace. Those written before my time.
She holds the light for those who died, so die for me and pray for me."

Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping

No communication will kill it every time
So open up your heart, baby we can work it out

When you lived on Stanhope Road
We listened to your sister
When she came home from school
'Cause she was two years older
And she had boys in her room
We listened outside and heard her
Alright
Well, that was alright for a while
But soon, I wanted more
I want to see as well as hear
And so I hid inside her wardrobe
And she came home 'round four
And she was with some kid called David
From the garage up the road
I listened outside, I heard her
Alright

Oh, I want to take you home
I want to give you children
And you might be my girlfriend, yeah

When I saw you next day
I really couldn't tell you
'Cause you might go and tell your mother
And so you went with Neve
And Neve was coming on
And I thought I heard you laughing
When his mum and dad were gone
I listened outside, I heard you
Alright

Oh, I want to take you home
I want to give you children
You might be my girlfriend, yeah

Well, I guess it couldn't last too long
I came home one day
And all her things were gone
I fell asleep inside
I never heard her come
And then she opened up her wardrobe
And I had to get it on
Oh, listen we were on the bed
When you came home
I heard you stop 
Outside the door
I know you won't
Believe it's true
I only went with her

Someone comes to take you to the
Edge of something new
Why is it so hard for you to fall?

I have stood alone
Watched you from a distance of a
Friend who understands
One who'd always be there if you

Knew you what you are looking for
And you know it when you find it

With the key in your hand
It's time to walk a naked stage
Of glass from hot sands
Where a sound within your heart will rage
And if rocks in the head moving ever on
Life is an unforgettable opera

The time will come again
When staring in your eyes a place that
You have seen before
Always something to remind you

It's not a game of chance
Some you lose and some you just can't
Win them all at once
Time will give you everything

It's a rhythm that will never stop
It's like a clock that ticks between us

And the keys in your hand
Your time to walk a naked stage
Of glass from hot sands
Where a sound within your heart will rage
And if rocks in the head moving ever on
Life is an unforgettable opera

Take the key in your hands
It's time you walked that naked stage
Of glass from hot sands
Where a sound within your heart will rage

With the key in your hands
It's time to walk a naked stage
Of glass from hot sands
Where a sound within your heart will rage

I cleanse like soap, 'cause it's the great black hope

The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission

With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round

And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie

There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I simplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Pefect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire 
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla

Era su nariz su pecado y su condena

Snif snif todo por la nariz

Era Medellín su tierra prometida
Era el polvo blanco su maná y su alegría
No era un camello sino una caravana
La que le pasaba la materia colombiana
Era que estudiaba geografía americana
Era que amaba a Toni Montana
Y era el pegamento y las colas industriales
Sus otras pasiones sus efectos personales

Todo por la napia
Snif snif todo por la nariz

Era que oía a su madre que decía
Perico, no te excites y Perico se reía
Era el placer para su pituitaria
Todo lo que entraba fuera línea o fuera raya
Era que despacio y poco a poco su tabique
Se había desgastado se había ido a pique
Y era que escuchaba el consejo del vecino
Haz como yo y ponte uno de platino

You never grow out of contemplating

You never grow out of mistake making
You never grow out of faking

How long to sing this song?
How long to sing this song?
How long, how long, how long

And made my footsteps firm

One phase of night has reached an ending now.
And nothin', nothin' lasts forever,
Except forever, and you, my love. 

And so will you, my love:
My love. 

The street is dark here while I walk alone,
An' since you've gone, I always walk alone.
'Cause nothin', nothin' lasts forever,
Except forever, and you, my love. 

And so will you, my love:
My love. 

And so will you, my love:
Your memories always near.
Wherever I am found,
Your memories still around. 

The dawn an' I arrive at home at last.
Night turns it's lonely face toward the past.
'Cause nothin', nothin' lasts forever,
Except forever, and you, my love. 

And so will you, my love:
My love."

They told me I was such a fool to love you
They say that you're the kind who'd never be true
Pretty soon the day would come when I'd be the sorry one
But I said that I'm not afraid; well
That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made

I went ahead and my heart opened the door
I gave you so much love, no one could want more
You pretended to be mine, how could you be so unkind?
With all the other girls you've played; well
That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are mad

(That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made)

I know you're not sincere, and you'll never be
But, still, I want your kisses so desperately
I can never let you go
Baby, even though I know every rule of love you've disobeyed; well

That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made
That's how heartaches are made"

But a man is just a handful of dust

You take the best of everything I've got
Then take it all, still want I don't know what
But you're a star about to tumble, a balloon about to bust
But a man is just a handful of dust

Lovin' livin' ain't enough
Devil-driven graveyard stuff
High is flyin', play the clown
Ain't no flyin' six feet down

Ain't no place worth goin' ain't already been
No sin worth sinnin' ain't already sinned

I'll miss you

I'll dream of you
And I'll cry a million tears
But the sorrow will pass
And the one thing that will last
Is the love that you've given to me

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know he'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile and tell them he told me so
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so

Now if I call him on the telephone
And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
He kisses me and he holds me tight
He tells me ""baby, everything's all all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him so"

A new day shines like the sun

You give me songs to sing
You give me dreams to dream
All I ever wanted I find here with you
Forget the world is the world
Forget the world is in pain
Somehow it got out of hand
Somehow I don't comprehend

A new day has begun
A new day shines like the sun

Your lips are sweet
It's all I need from life

I know I will never let you go
I will never let this go

It takes all my strength just to keep it calm
I hove to tell myself, just let it breathe
holding it inside will only help to do me in
Each time I close my eyes I see another chain
it's one I can't forget, something I can not break out of

I need a second skin, something to hold me up
can't seem to get out of this hole
I've dug myself right back in

Just to wake up tells me I must be brave
It hits me like a drug shot into my vein
It's not as delightful of a pain
immobilizing me
almost makes me think I'm dead

I need a second skin
something to hold me tough
Can't do it on my own
sometimes I need just a little more help
I want that chance to give every drop that's left in me
I need a second skin
something I can not break out of

I tell myself, just let it breathe
It's a calmness I'm always searching for
But the dirt it gets so heavy
it falls above my head
seeping from under my feet
it just keeps on getting deeper

I need a second skin
something to hold me up
Can't do it on my own
sometimes I need just a little more help
I've got that chance to give every drop that's left in me
I need a second skin
something I cannot break free of

Though no one ever said it'd be easy
Still one's left to deny the choice that comes
between your willingness to survive
Though you're knowing what you stand up against
a world set to deceive
You need a special strength

I've got that second skin
I've got that chance to give
I've got the only way that I know how to live with it
I need a second skin
something to hold me tough
I need a second skin
something I cannot break out of"

Wash him from me

Along comes the wind
A big bone shaker
Blows off my clothes
Completely naked
What to do
When everything's
Left you

Out of the blue
It is he
Vision to me
Bearing leaves
Petals green
Covers me
In all my shame

Hand in hand
He's my big man
Stays with me
Some forty days
No words
Then goes away
I cry a-gain

On my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind X5"

Today is your birthday if I'm not wrong
If I'm not mistaken you're fifty today
How are you doin', Bob? What do you say?

Well, it musta been about '62
I heard you on record, and you were brand-new
An' some had some doubts about the way you sang
But the truth came through and loudly rang
Yeah, you were hipper than Mitch Miller
And Johnny Mathis, put together

So I got some boots, a harmonica rack
A D-21, an' I was on the right track
But I didn't start writing until '68
It was too damn daunting, you were too great
I won a whole lot of Bob Dylan imitation contests, though, huh

Yeah, times were a-changin'
You brought it all home
""Blonde On Blonde"", ""Like a Rolling Stone""
The real world is crazy, you were deranged
An' when you went electric, why, everything changed
A shock to the system

Had a commission at yer motorcycle wreck
Holed up in Woodstock, with a broken neck
The labels were signin' up guys with guitars
Out to make millions, lookin' for stars
Well, I figured it was time to make my move
Songs from the West Chester County Delta country

Yeah, I got a deal and so did John Prine
Steve Forbert and Springsteen, all in a line
They were lookin' for you, signin' up others
We were ""new Bob Dylans"", your dumb-ass kid brothers
Well, we still get together every week at Bruce's house
Why, he's got quite a spread, I tell ya it's a twelve-step program

Well, but we were just us and of course you were you
""John Wesley Harding"" sure sounded new
And then ""Nashville Skyline"" was even newer
'Blood On the Tracks', an' the ringin' got truer
Let's see, there was another one in there somewhere
Oh, I got it, I got it, ""Self Portrait""
Well, it was an interesting effort

Yeah, had to stop listening, times were too tough
Me bein' the new me was hard enough
You keep right on changin' like you always do
An' what's best is the old stuff still all sounds new

Yeah, today is your birthday, have a great one, Bob!
Bein' the new you is one hell of a job
My kid cranked up her boom-box to almost grown
When I heard you screamin' from her room
""Everybody must get stoned""
Thanks a lot, Bob

Boys kissed the girls, then made them cry
That's a man's job, that is why
When you cry, you're just a clone
Of every woman I have known

And every Harry, Dick and Tom
Gets all of this shit from his mom

Because of a wall that dad had

Scriviamo i nostri nomi per essere eterni
Ma arriverà l'inverno e i nostri nomi la pioggia prenderà
Restiamo e di notte riprende la tua monotona e lenta regia

Ma restiamo ancora qui in due davanti a questo grande sogno
E apriamo i nostri occhi per dirci s'è vero o no
Ma scivolando nella luce questo sogno finirà
Rinchiuso in una stanza o perso dentro un bar
Restiamo ancora qui in due, davanti c'è soltanto un'ombra
Cerchiamo di spostarla ma è troppo pesante
E non c'è niente per scalfire un'ombra o per buttarla giù

He was whipping through the pit,
knocked her onto the stage,
She said, ""Have your fun, but stop being so lame.""

He must have wieghed a ton
Said, ""Get outta here girlie!

So you wanna have some fun?
Well, break out the big guns.

His fists started flying
They dodged each punch
As he kept trying

Tripped on his own feet and hit the floor

Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass,'till mc's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep...
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

Don't Sweat the Technique

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

But don't sweat the technique

I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something  brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never  irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

Don't sweat the technique (2x)"

I'm hungry still
To see what's down another road
Beyond the hill
And do it all again

And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Funny how the time just flies
How love can go
From warm hellos
To sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories
You've memorized
To keep your winters warm

For there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings
Or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game
I want to play
For laughs 
For life
For love

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
Here's to life
For dreamers and their dreams

And all that's good get better

Is this the moment of truth

Is that the last man down 
Is that the last life laid to waste 
Can we find in our hearts 
Each and every dream we've misplaced 
Before Heaven cries tears 
On the mountain we climb 

Farewell to arms 
Rest in peace 
May the rain of freedom be released 
Farewell to arms 
We just can't walk away 
We're all sharing this Earth at the end of the day 

So when the cold wind bites 
And the mad dogs speak 
However dark is your night 
Just keep turning your cheek 
'Cause when the last shot's fired 
It is then the world will be free 
And still we are asking 
Just how long will it be 
Though we're blown by the crosswinds 
We stand like a tree 

Farewell to arms 
Rest in peace 
May the rain of freedom be released 
Farewell to arms 
We just can't walk away 
We're all sharing this earth at the end of the day 

Down this road we've wandered for so many years 
With every step we take 
We can tear down all frontiers 
Make no mistake 

Farewell to arms 
Rest in peace 
May the rain of freedom be released"

You made the night seem endless
You cast a magic spell
You played the part so well
Your music blew away the darkness
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse
The night that the stars didn't show
You made me stand so proud
I was lifted from the crowd
The fire inside me burning
The figure dressed in black
Sending shivers down my back
Deep inside my soul was stirring
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
The sweet inspiration that you gave us
And i can remember we didn't rehearse
The night that the stars didn't show
Mountains may crumble

And worlds fall apart
Lovers and friends may desert me
The road may be long
But I know in my heart
Your spirit will always be with me
The thrill to be up there
A sea of faces everywhere
I look I find you
We loved you for better
We loved you for worse
But we never took you for granted
Your lives were a blessing
But they carried a curse

Ma come è dolce certe sere 
A volte no, senza pietà 
Mi chiude in una stanza mi fa sentire solo 

Una città, senza pietà, la mia città 
Non la conosco mai fino in fondo 
Troppi portoni, troppi cassetti 
Io non ti trovo mai tu dimmi dove sei 

Adesso dove si va, cosa si fa, dove si va 
Siamo sempre dentro a qualcosa 
Un'auto che va o dentro un tram 
Senza mai vedere il cielo e respirando smog 

Ma guarda là, che cazzo fa, ma pensa te 
Ma come guida quel deficiente 
Poi guarda qua, che ora e' già 
Ma chi ti ha dato la patente che ti scoppiasse un dente 
A te 

Siamo sempre di corsa sempre in agitazione 
Anche teche anche se lecchi il gelato 
C'hai lo sguardo incazzato 

La mia città, senza pietà, la mia città 
Ma come è bella la mattina 
Quando si sveglia, quando si accende, 
E ricominciano i rumori promette tante cose 

Ma dimmidove sarà, prima era qua 
C'è un nero che chiede aiuto 
Dove sarà questa città 
E' sparita senza pietà c'ha troppi muri la mia città 

Ma guarda che civiltà la mia città 
Con mille sbarre alle finestre 
Porte blindate, guardie giurate, 
E un miliardo di antifurti che stanno sempre a suonareperché 

C'è chi ha troppo di meno e chi non si accontenta 
E c'èchi si deve bucare in un angolo di dolore 
E c'èche c'è bisogno di un trucco c'è bisogno di tutto 

Senza pietà, la mia città 
""Signora guardi che belle case 
Però a lei no, non gliela do 
Mi dispiace signora mia è tutto uso foresteria"" 

Una città la mia città, senza pietà 
Ti dice che non è vero 
Che non c'è più la povertà 
Perché è tutta coperta dalla pubblicità 

C'è chi a lavorare è obbligato a imbrogliare 
E c'èchi per poterti fregare ha imparato a studiare 
E c'èche c'è bisogno di tutto c'è bisogno di un trucco 
E c'èbisogno di più amore dentro a questa prigione"

As the waves plain near her feet
Looking over the distant horizon
At a ship in this silent retreat

As a sad moon shines down upon her
She whispers a fond farewell
To the man she loves aboard the ship
For she's a seaman's girl

A seaman's girl lives a life that is lonely
While her man is gone out to sea
The smile that she wears as she's seeing him on
Seems to hide her fuse and misery

And a love that she bears for her seafaring man
Will live on for evermore
Though the life beloved gives on the sea
And her lives on the shore

True is the love that is burning
In the heart of a seaman's girl
It's the waiting gain but she never complain
She wouldn't trade him for all of this world

Her tears she hides from her seaman
Though they may never kiss nomore
While he meets with the dangers of a deep rolling sea
A seaman's girl must wait on the shore"

79,The Disposable Heroes Of Hiphoprisy,Language Of Violence,TRDGKTY128C7196B77,1992,"The first day of school was always the hardest
The first day of school the hallways the darkest
Like a gauntlet
the voices haunted
Walking in with his thin skin lowered chin
He knew the names that they would taunt him with
Faggot sissy punk queen queer
Although he'd never had sex in his 15 years
And when they harassed him it was for a reason
And when they provoked him it became open season
for the fox and the hunter, the sparks and the thunder
that pushed the boy under, then pillage and plunder
It kind of makes you wonder
how one can hurt another
But dehumanizing the victim makes things simpler
It's like breathing with a respirator
It eases the conscience of even the most conscious
and calculating violator
Words can reduce a person to an object,
something more easy to hate
An inanimate entity, completely disposable,
no problem to obliterate
(CHORUS:)
But death is the silence
in this language of violence
Death is the silence
But death is the silence
in this cycle of violence
death is the silence
It's tough to be young, the young long to be tougher
When we pick on someone else it might make us feel rougher
Abused by their fathers but was at home though
so to prove to each other that they were not homos
The exclamation of the phobic fury
executioner, a judge and jury
The mob mentality, individuality was nowhere
Dignity forgotten at the bottom of a dumb old dare and a numb cold
stare
On the way home it was back to name calling
Ten against one they had his back up against the wall and
they reveled in their laughter as they surrounded him
But it wasn't a game when they up jumped and grounded him
They picked up their bats with their muscles straining
and they decided they were gonna beat this fella's brain in
with an awful, powerful, showerful, an hour full of violence
Inflict the strictest brutality and dominance
They didn't hear him screaming, they didn't hear him pleading
They ran like cowards and left the boy bleeding
in a pool of red 'til all tears were shed
and his eyes quietly slid into the back of his head
dead...
(CHORUS)
(2x)
You won't see the face 'til the eyelids drop
You won't hear the screaming until it stops
The boy's parents were gone and his grandmother had raised him
She was mad she had no form of retaliation
The pack didn't have to worry about being on a hitlist
But the thing they never thought about was that there was a witness
to this senseless crime, right place wrong time
Tried as an adult one of them was gonna do hard time
The first day of prison was always the hardest
The first day of prison, the hallways the darkest
Like a gauntlet
the voices haunted
Faggot, sissy, punk, queen, queer
Words he used before had a new meaning in here
As a group of men in front of him came near
for the first time in his life the young bully felt fear
He'd never been on this side of the name calling
Five against one they had his back up against the wall and
he had never questioned his own sexuality
but this group of men didn't hesitate in their reality
with an awful, powerful, showerful, an hour full of violence
Inflict the strictest brutality and dominance
They didn't hear him screaming
They didn't hear him pleading
They took what they wanted and then left him bleeding in the corner
The giant reduced to jack horner
But dehumanizing the victim makes things simpler
It's like breathing with a respirator
It eases the conscience of even the most conscious
and calculating violator
The power of words, don't take it for granted
when you hear a man ranting
Don't just read the lips, be more sublime than this
Put everything in context, is this a tale of rough justice
in a land where there's no justice at all ?
Who is really the victim ? Or are we all the cause, and victim of it
all ?

My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talkin
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalkin
This slimmy caught me peepin, this means she wasnt sleepin
On who I was, so she crept in like a hawk
In a minutes time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note cause of the way that she was walkin
We got into the groove, I didnt bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought wed be forever
Didnt have an um-ber-ella, now Im soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall itll be together
Never sympin, and leave your love life limp
Therell be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
Cuz you know theres otha fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

(chorus 3x)
(in the sea) you know theres otha fish in the sea that is

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be olive oyls number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
Shes heavy on the mind sometimes its more than I can handle
But men arent supposed to tumble into the den b
Macho, but I hancho like pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper, are they fakin or for real?
Whats the deal dabbers? will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because Im sick of this
Bitch lickin drip drip from a niggaz benefits
He doesnt even suit ya and hes surely not ya size
Im surprised that you slept on a heart thats worldwide
And when ya open up ya eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That ya dont bruise a limb, as ya swim with otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

(chorus 3x)

Now, if there aint no mountain high enough
Why aint you climbin up?
My hand has been extended every since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didnt even know ya
Bro, youre stupid, cause ya thought youd catch a cupid
And you found that love aint two wiffs of shit
So I resign or quit
It aint even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussywhip, elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didnt fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
Id charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they steppin with my lady
They workin on a baby, Im pushin up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I wont play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me big gibraltor miss
No, I wont diss, Im just like on to otha fish in the sea
In the sea that is

(chorus 3x)

You know theres otha, you know that theres otha
(chorus repeats 20x)

In the sea, baby (4x)"

Couldn't paint a picture to illuminate his heart
But I knew what he had seen
He tried to trace the changes that had taken place
I saw them written all over his face
And I knew what he had seen

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He saw the shape of grace

There was a time he'd said that he could never believe
In the kind of mercy he did not need
And he drew himself away
It was a broken heart and an endless thirst
That drove him to the love he did not deserve
And he knew what he had found

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape of grace
(What did he find?)
In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape
Of grace

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He saw the shape of grace

In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape
Of grace"
87,Tom Cochrane,Brave And Crazy,TRELXNL128F145C7AB,1992,"He sat down with his guitar in a distant place
When a man walks up and tells him
""Buddy there are some things you cannot say""
I'll be damned if you'll tell me
What I can and cannot feel
I won't be no puppet here none of your back room deals
Modern love was invented by the minstrels in the dark ages
Where they used to hunt them down from town to town
Man what deck are we dealing from here
When a girl walks up and says
""You got something we've got to hear""

Brave and crazy...brave on
Brave and crazy...brave on

Along the boardwalk of this burned out tourist town
The ghosts of another day stalk the barren beaches
Where all come to hide from the rattling of the sounds
Of skeletons in the closet
Hoping nothing brings them down
She says ""I have lived nearly all my life""
""I scare them to death because I say what I like""

Brave and crazy...brave on
Brave and crazy...brave on

There's a war here between freedom and the hypocrites
Who will try on all disguises just to see what fits
Truth is the one thing to live love and die for
The rooftops of the world

Brave on...

He packs his car and picks a course upon a map
Maybe east of eden or maybe farther west than all of that
Writes down everything he's seen, everything that he feels
Then rips it up it doesn't say enough then throws it is a passing field

Brave and crazy...brave on"

And this night so much colder than every night
And she says, she likes winter and winter-trees
And the sun seens so far away tonight
In the dark and deep, frozen water the light
Of the moon under which she dies
O the moon under which we cry

...death knocking at the door... I must let him in...
Life like a river flows... outside... stay alive!
Ten-thousand good reasons to survive...

And warm friendships grow cold,
There'll be someone waiting for you. 

And if you ever find,
That fate is unkind,
An' the devil starts takin' his dues.
When your fair weather friends,
Leave when fair weather ends,
There'll be someone waiting for you. 

You'll always have someone who loves you.
You're never alone, don't you see?
And when your world's slowin' down,
You'll need someone around:
Let that someone always be me.

Won't they learn they'll never win
Play into the hands of the media vultures
We must learn to unite our cultures
Violence constantly tears us apart
Show the world that we've got heart
Chorus:
Blood is spilled on black and white
Different colors, why do we fight
Face the facts, stone cold sober
Black and white and red all over
Thousands die and kill each other
Someone rapes and stabs their mother
I think it's sick to count the death toll
On and on the media rolls
Drive by shootings, homicide
Nobody cares about the mother who cried
A family's grief stepped on by ratings
Understand why I keep hating
It makes no sense for us to be pawns
In the chess game that the media plays
If the streets are where you run
There you die, why ? Find yourself a way out
Black and white and red all over
Ruling out the positive and any hope for peace
This will only kill the moral, paper sales increase
This shit has got to cease
Black and white and red all over
Believe half of what you read and half of what you see
Put two and two together and you'll have reality
Can't you see my reality ?

I was not in full arrest
And the symptoms were induced by something

Some loose track

Come on let's go
You started learnin'
What you don't need to know

Run from the past

Whistle still blowin'
But the train is gone
Ain't no wheels
Gonna take me from my home

We are waiting for ground zero

The wall is high beyond is much to find
A barrier we built so long ago
With fearful hope and a faith that is not blind
From clouds of joy we'll see the depths below

Across the sea and far away
The eyes of all the world await the Passion Play
The final act at last begun
The new is born the old is bound to pass away
No more the turn of the pages
And now the hope of the ages
For all the bondage is broken, all who see

The oracles, the prophets of the past
The miracle of knowledge was revealed
The plan was laid upon a strong foundation
So long ago the future was sealed

You boogied down to the Stones and the Beatles and shit 
You used to lay in the park, relax and kick off your shoes
Perhaps light up a joint and listen to Rhythm and Blues yeah 
I'm Stevie Bee, Maroon Town with me 
And don't forget the devious drummer will amaze
Because time won't stop
Because time will fly
But time will answer every question why
Why every woman, every man in the sixties span
Will always have a dance for their favourite band And if you're thinking what the hell do we know 
While we play this funky shit on our stereo 

You know we're speaking of Nostalgia
You see we're speaking of Nostalgia
I'm speaking, Maroon Town speaking, II hope you're speaking
Can't you see we're speaking yeah, yeah oh yeah
That's Nostalgia 

So take time out, scream and shout
Because the fabulous brother and sisters 
Are turning it out 
Do you remember when you used to go bopping 
You would sit back down to watch Batman and Robin 
All those silly crazy things that you thought you were doing 
Coz you used to watch the Prisoner with Patrick McGoohan 

That's right hold tight
We're speaking of Nostalgia
I'm speaking, I hope you're speaking
Can't you see we're speaking 
Are you speaking, yeah, oh Nostalgia 

Chelsea boots and mohair suits
Trendy people flashing their loot 
Taking the blues watching the news 
Demonstrations, airing your views 
Doctor Spock, Captain Kirk 
Generation that loved to flirt 
Getting down to the funky sound of the one and only James Brown 
Mods and Rockers having fight
Zooming around on your Vespa bike 
Out of touch out of reach
Out of their heads on Brighton Beach
Flower Power, paint your face Baby boom for the human race
Mini skirts and magazines
Goodbye Miss Norma Jean 
Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet, Doris Day
Walking, walking down the street 
Talking to someone you meet
Talk about the Go Go beat
Twist and shout, stamp your feet 
Crazy colours, kaleidoscope blue
And don't forget the goddam Who 

We're speaking of Nostalgia
I' m speaking, I hope you're speaking
Can't you see we're speaking Are you speaking, yeah, oh on Nostalgia"

And I take my medication
And I spend the rest of the day

Every night I stay up late
And make my state more desperate
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Every now and then
I get an urge to drive around
Get into my car then I'll
Maybe go uptown
Take my medication
Do my best to get it on
And I spend the rest of the night
Waiting for it to wear off
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Every time I say this
I just know this time I mean it
But a feeling deep inside
Says it's okay one more time
I'm waiting for a time when I can be without
These things that make me feel
This way all of the time.
Makes me feel so good
Makes me feel so fine
Makes me feel so good
Leaves me fucked up inside

Medicate my eyes
Medicate my life

Gonna feel so good
Gonna feel just fine
Don't feel so good

So far from where I intended to go

Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
So far from where I'm determined to go

Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way

Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
But you see, I've got no charm

Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Oh, this is very clear to you

And you can tell I have never really loved
You can tell by the way I sleep all day

And all of my life no one gave me anything
No one has ever given me anything

My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
You must be such a fool to pass me by"
111,Pavlov's Dog,Did You See Him Cry,TRAZAXN128F92D2C50,1992,"How many times has he waited there
Beneath the boughs of angel hair
Woollen coat pulled tight against the wind
That whipped and chafed his face
And left him not much more
Apart from his old dreams
That new lovers cannot own
Or hope to ever know
What's behind an old man's lonely tears

When he's alone and the sun is high
The children laugh and he'd like to hide
Days like these seem to hang on for so long
They seem to drag him down
And leave him that much more apart
And he wishes someone would invite him home
To pass the time or to maybe find some time
Or maybe...

And did you see him cry?

Did you ever watch him pace
And all the ways he tries to hide his face
Misplaced all in a world not like his own
And did you ever stop to speak
Or hear him try to tell about
How she and he were lovers just like you
And they were just like you

Did you ever watch him pace
And all the ways he tries to hide his face
Misplaced all in a world not like his own
Did you ever stop to speak
Or hear him try to tell about
How she and he were lovers just like you
And they were just like you"

a religious belief of magical fate
Necronomic tribes of the secret societies

Conducting ceremonies of the Vodoun faith
Revenge in store for enemies they hate
Soon to die awaiting to arise

Doomed to die by a malevolent curse
Carnival of chaos
Symbolic designs
carved in the earth to beckon LEGBA

(Rites of the Petro)

Reflections of rage and violence
Thundering drums echo unforgiving

Tribal chants grow louder
Dancers travel throughout the fire

Deity of fire OGU
Protects skin from the flames

Divine horsemen arrive
mounting the initiation of possession

Tearing glass / utter pandemonium
spirits indulge in burning torches

Spinnig dancers wake to reality

Vodoun - cannot be abstracted from the day to day life - of the Believer
All is whole - no separation between material and spiritual

The Bokor concocts the powder with the poisonous Datura
sprinkled upon the way of his victim
Body racked with terrible convulsions -
Mucus flowered from the nose and mouth shaking horrible

The edge of consciousness
criteria of poison
Lethargic coma
Indistinguishable from death

Comatose
Mentally alive / pronounced phisically dead
Nails driven into the coffin buried prematurely
Mind slips / disoriented / complete amnesia
Three days fermented incarnation of Evil

Baron SAMEDI
Guardian of the cemetery
Preparing the victim's soul
for Zombification

The fear initiates the victim
Psychologically vulnerable
Powder does not secure
Fate / its the mind
Baron unleashes cadaver
A soul trapped in a vessel
Blood spilt offering
Resurrection of zombie
Body without character
Aimlessly wandering through time
Servant to the Bokor
Le culte Des morts"

Too much attraction, kiss of passion
Strong reaction, lots of action

We're alone at last

You know how to love me, like no one has before
You've got what i need and you give me so much more
Boy now i hear you calling, voices in the wind

Pay! Paying! Paying to play!

But a tour or a show was always in the works
With coc, the dks, or the circle jerks
We would play for beer, for food, and for gas
Eating government cheese and trading blood for cash

I was always hungry, tense and weird
Trench coat, mange, half a beard
I slept on park benches and I'll never forget
The cold and rain and all the shit
Everyone with money and me with none
When you don't have any, it's not much fun

What's happening, it's been so long, what's going on
And what's going wrong? The good old days are gone
You forgot your plot and your plans as a young man
You invented a scam even you don't understand
You rig the enigma, can't figure it out
You change the route, now you're in doubt
You use to cut class, smoked grass, still passed,
Figured you was all that but that ain't last;
The times is harder, the drugs is heavier
You say whatever, the more, the merrier;
Smoke chokes your dreams and blurs your scenes,
Now a young man fiend change his plan to schemes;
No more good times, no more time,
Too far to find, you're almost blind,
You can't see what spot that the trap is in...

You had it mapped out, your plans get torn,
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond

My neighborhood don't look so good
I'll find a way out.. yeah, I would if I could,
But the government is doing a project...
so I live in the projects;
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom,
Try to live long but you die too soon,
I might not be alive to see 25,
Taught at ten to make money and strive;
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends,
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run wit,
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun wit;
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test,
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress!
And then shake hands like a man,
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand!
But you had a one on one fight wit drugs,
When we ain't cool no more, we buss slugs,
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone...
(Hey bra!) what's going on?

Yo, what's going on?

The crime rate in New York State elevate,
A city filled wit hate, more deaths accumulate,
Drug wars daily, alot of blood spilt,
Kids on the playground shot down and kilt!
Nobody wants to live on the 1st floor no more...
'Cause stray bullets explore!
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely,
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out!
Half of the projects is dead or locked up,
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up.
Human abortion create distortions...
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are  addicted to drugs when they are born....!

The way that your fingers run through my hair,
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there.

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh,
And how you enjoy your two hour bath.
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane.

But I love the way you love me.
Strong and wild, slow and easy.
Heart and soul, so completely.
I love the way you love me.

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
an' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key.
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me.
Strong and wild, slow and easy.
Heart and soul, so completely.
I love the way you love me.

And I could list a million things I love to like about you,

When I'm sad
To get a hole
Like no one else can do

And all
My child life
Bitterness
Tangled envy
He'd fake it if he could be

And we'll
Call the night sky
Stolen memories
As they fake

There's a key
To open up
Your mind!
I can see 
Your mind!
I can see 
Your mind!

If 
You can float
Get that feeling 
I know that feeling
Sometimes lifes too old

And then
Save our hard love
Passionate
Pain it comes
Sometimes it hurts like hell

And will
We find that meaning ?
Feeling numb
Feeling cold


(I doubt these lyrics are right,
but it was the best I could do trying
to understand what he was saying)

There's a key
To open up
Your mind!
I can see 
Your mind!
I can see 
Your mind!
I can see
Your mind!

I can see 
Your mind!
I can see 
I can see your mind"

I wanna know, where to go if I get scared... and...
I wanna be, in a place where no one cares, and...

I, i, I wanna know you!

I wanna feel like Im floatin in the air... and...
I wanna know if the sunss gonna bleach my hair... and
I wanna know why lifes so unfair and...

I wanna know you!
Because youre so damn cool!
Yeah, youre so damn cool!

Who knows what Im feelin inside of me!
And who knows if Im feelin all right!
Who knows what Im feelin inside of me
Who knows what is runnin around in my brain

Now that Im done and I seen it
And dont think that Im tryin to complain
Dont think Im lyin cause I mean it
N all you people out there dont look at me to lay
All of your blame cause you need me
And you want me to go down
In flames with the rest
But Im so sick of denyin
What is runnin around in my brain"
132,Tracy Chapman,Matters Of The Heart (LP Version),TRQCIIR128F92EDA65,1992,"I lose my head
From time to time
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

We should have been holding each other
Instead we talked
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

But I asked before
Your reply was kind and polite
One wants more
When one's denied
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

I won't call it love
But it feels good to have passion in my life
If there's a battle
I hope my head always defers to my heart
In matters of the heart

I guess I'm crazy to think
I can give you what you don't want
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

Make myself sick
I can't think of anything else
I can't sleep at night
I make a fool of myself
In matters of the heart

I wish that I had the power
To make these feelings stop
I lose all self control
In matters of the heart

I can't believe
It's so hard to find someone
To give affection to
And from whom you can receive
I guess it's just the draw of the cards
In matters of the heart

You caught me off guard
Somehow you reached me
Where I thought I had nothing left inside
I've learned a lesson I've been edified
In matters of the heart

I've spent my nights
Where the sleeping dogs lie
Not by your side
It feels so lonely
Once again I've left too much to chance
In matters of the heart

Here I sit
I'm feeling sorry for myself
It's quite a sight
But I have you to blame
For reminding me
We're all alone in this world
In matters of the heart

I'm already missing you
Although we won't say good-byes
Until tomorrow afternoon
Maybe when and if I see you again
We'll see eye to eye
In matters of the heart

I have no harsh words for you
I have no tears to cry
If the moon were full
I'd be howling inside
It only hurts
In matters of the heart

If today were my birthday
I'd be reborn
As Bronte's bird
A bird that could fly
And all accounts would be settled
In matters of the heart

Matters of the heart"

Snarling, growling, snapping
At the tails of others
I've been feeding
Off the scraps they left behind
And begging for more
Maybe I've been whimpering
And scratching at the door
But now I'm
A dog with sharper teeth
A dog with sharper teeth

Gnawing at the bones
Of those you know
Can only moan when bitten
Chasing my own tail
A rabid dog
Whose on the trail of nothing
Dragged round on a leash
Until I'd chewed through
No more hesitation
A dog with sharper teeth
A dog with sharper teeth

Whipped and beaten down
By words you know aren't
What they sound like meaning
I stuck with the pack
With my paws crossed
Behind my back
But now I'm
A dog with sharper teeth
A dog with sharper teeth

I'm not your dogsbody
I'm not your dogsbody
I'm not your dogsbody
I'm not your dogsbody

Jos on heikko ne hyökkää sutena kimppuun

Katso johtajaa ja katsot johtajan sorkkaan ja sarveen

Vain äiti on äaiti ja lapsi on lapsi ne yhdessa nyyhkyttää

Break away the chains that bind you

Feel the engines burning hot
Pounding out the sound
A free man proud

Forever free, riding with the wind in your hair (*)
Forever free, forever free

Take me where the four winds blow
Let me see the magic in your eyes
Just take the shackles from your soul
Imagination soaring to the skies
Journey to the rainbow's end
Searching for the freedom in your heart

Take me to the open plains
Let me drive along the desert road
Break away the chains that blind you
Now you're free to make it on your own
Feel the engines burning hot

136,David Byrne,Twistin' In The Wind ( LP Version ),TRWAOKZ128F9341F5B,1992,"Now Washington, DC's
A funny little town
The further you look into it
The further things stick out

You oughta be ashamed
You oughta be destroyed
I'll chop you into little bits
And feed you to my dogs

Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

Now can you picture this?
A taste of what will be
The weatherman is wrong again
It looks like rain to me

I heard the whistle blow
The train has jumped the track
The mighty engine's outa gas
Bureaucratic heart attack

My sister likes the boys
They kinda like her, too
My mama says, ""Be careful""
Sister says, ""Now, that ain't cool""

My daddy fell in love
Down at the factory
And me, I like to sit around
Get high, and watch TV

Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

Now I can take a joke
I'm laughin' at myself
I faked my way through college
And I faked my way through sex

I've been falling down too long
I've been bangin' up my head
And if I could stay on my feet
I'd prob'ly go right back again

Now Harry's got a gun
And he just turned fourteen
He dresses like a gangster
And he's livin' on the street

They kicked him in the balls
They shaved off all his hair
They put a current through his head
And left him lyin' there

Well well well well well
What have we got here?
What have we got now?
Hey hey hey hey hey
Twistin' in the wind
Twistin' all night long

They say that crime don't pay
The judge does not agree
'Cause if you got the money
He will surely set you free

I'll watch you burn in hell
I'll see you in your grave
I'd like to watch you suffer for
The evil that you made

Hi-dee hi-dee ho
What a funny clown
The fat man he fell off the wall
And he can't get up again

It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodnight
Whoever is the last one out
Well, please turn out the light"

Small minds wear me down
Spreadading salt on fertile ground
Honest pleasures now forsaken
Drastic measures to be taken

It's time so let your future unfold

Dangerous walls are closin' in
They twist the truth
Then give it a spin
Love's a grenade, I'll pull the pin

Shadows flower into the light

You think I'm bad
You think I'm bad
Well I'm the most fun that you ever had
So good, so good
But people say I'm a bad influence
Wide mouths, narrow minds
Can't accept your difference
Open season on new ideas
They call it bad influence

It's time for liberation to flow
Free mind, free soul
It's time so let your future unfold

My bad my bad influence
Just a bad influence
My bad my bad influence
Call it bad

Wide mouths with narrow minds
Narrow minds, creak and grind
Rally to a peaceful sound
Let the barriers tumble down

I want to run outside and shed my clothes
But I want to stay with you
Long enough to love you right
And I want to say to you
I love the patience in your eyes

Here I am standing in a circle of quiet
Where a truce is tactily observed
Standing in a circle of quiet
Waiting for the world to turn
Waiting for the world to turn
Waiting for the world to turn

And a hundred days and night could find me scattered
All around the world without a name
But you're more than just a feather in my hat
More than just a fetter on my frame

I want to go out and chase the stars

I want to stay where you are

There is no shadow of turning"

Looking for love but you settle for a kiss and unknown arms to hold you tight
But it seems no matter what you do it never turn out like you wanted it to
You wanted love, real true love, if you want love don't go to strangers

Every night I have this dream you're gonna wake up and understand
That all the love you've been looking for is right here in your hand oh my love

How many nights are you gonna lay down your sweet love to someone you don't really want

your big brown booty

I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
should I pursue to do you
or just stroke my knot
while my girl is asleep
I'm caught in a jam
went to the bathroom
with cocoa-butter in my hand
closed the door behind me
locked it very tight
thinkin' of all the naughty things we did last night
slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
and let the hand I hold the mike with
take control
closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
as my thoughts get deeper
and a little more intense

hit him in the heart with my (night struck a) slug

peep this

he climbed in my window
grabbed me around the neck
said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil

he was a brother
but this brother had the devil in his eye
he was out to get i-m-a-n-i
first I (took) my trigger finger with a wiggle
the devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
in the back of my head

I've got my nine I said
with my millimeter go bang
I got him
he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
he's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
bang bang bang
yep I got 'im again
his story's soundin' sad

Sometimes I can touch upon
The wonders that you see.

And pictures you've designed.

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,

Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.

You don't need directions,
You know which way to go
And I don't want to hold you back,
I just want to watch you grow.
You're the one who taught me
You don't have to look behind.

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,
Child of mine,
Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine.

Nobody's gonna kill your dreams
Or tell you how to live your life.
There'll always be people to make it hard for a while
But you'll change their heads when they see you smile.

The times you were born in
May not have been the best,
But you can make the times to come
Better than the rest,
I know you will be honest
If you can't always be kind,

Oh, yes sweet darling,
So glad you are a child of mine,
Child of mine,

Oh, yes sweet darling,

II. Stones of Years

Has the dawn ever seen your eyes?
Have the days made you so unwise?
Realise you are

Had you talked to the winds of time
Then you'd know how the waters rhyme
Taste of wine

How can you know where you've been?
In time you'll see the sign
And realise your sin

Will you know how the seed is sown?
All your time has been overgrown
Never known

Have you walked on the stones of years?
When you speak, is it you that hears?
Are your ears full?
You can't hear anything at all

IV. Mass

The preacher said a prayer
Save every single hair on his head
He's dead

The minister of hate
Had just arrived too late to be spared
Who cared?
The weaver in the web that he made

The pilgrim wandered in
Committing every sin that he could
So good

The cardinal of grief
Was set in belief he'd be saved
From the grave
The weaver in the web that he made

The high priest took a blade
To bless the ones that prayed
And all obeyed

The messenger of fear
Is slowly growing nearer to the time
A sign
The weaver in the web that he made

A bishops rings a bell
A cloak of darkness fell across the ground
Without a sound

The silent choir sing
And in their silence bring jaded sound
Harmonic ground
The weaver in the web that he made

VI. Battlefield

Clear the battlefield and let me see
All the profit from our victory
You talk of freedom, starving children fall
Are you deaf when you hear the season's call?

Were you there to watch the earth be scorched?
Did you stand beside the spectral torch?
Know the leaves of sorrow turned their face
Scattered on the ashes of disgrace

Every blade is sharp; the arrows fly
Where the victims of your armies lie
Were the blades of grass and arrows rain
Then there'd be no sorrow, be no pain

Now everything is destroyed 
Underneath us are the nothings
Underneath them is a void
Beyond that void is a place
Where figments from bad dreams are banished
Childhood nightmares all come seeking
And adult logic nearly vanished


Chaos
Inside-down, upside-out (This is what they sing in concert.) 

None of this is what I wanted
I truly asked for what I got
Bang the gavel, it's lawlessness
I can't unravel the knot


Half this wretched town is starving


While the other half are bloated
Everybody hates the bastards in power
But their pill is sugar coated


I didn't need any of this
I feel anxiety in my neck
The consequences now apparent
Feeding back unchecked
Incessant blue in spiral coils
Fingers underneath the skin
Adrenaline is not my mistress
But she always knows just where I've been"

I’m hungry for mercy, thirsty for slack,
Out in the outland, flesh and the dust,
Weight of the tired earth breaking my back,
Hope - where I left it under the skin,
Countenance of maidens, stance of the laddies,
The healing of old wounds, trust of my kin,
The voices of children calling me Daddy.

And your love never can fail to pierce me,
Hammers and nails,
Rhythm of passion, louder than Hell,
Thunder of Heaven,
Hammers and nails.

Light in the dark eyes, coal into diamonds,
Shelter from heavy skies, sand into pearls,
Bread for the breathless, cloth for the fresh wounds,
Order and chaos orbit the half-world,
The taste of a colour, flavour of light,
None but a blind man can measure that weight,
I am a deaf-mute, idle as statue,
Music of hemispheres lost in the half-haze.

And your love never can fail to pierce me,
Hammers and nails,
Rhythm of passion, louder than Hell,
Thunder of Heaven,
Hammers and nails.

Hum in the graveyard, whistle in the dark,
Stains on the stained glass, pains in the heart,
In darkened corners, love lies forgotten,
In the heat of the moment it waits to be spotted,
How could I slight you?
How could I turn?
How can you take it when I’m blind to your pain?
The burning of fingers, the smouldering nerves,
How can you take me back over and over again?

And your love never can fail to pierce me,
Hammers and nails,
Rhythm of passion, louder than Hell,
Thunder of Heaven,
Hammers and nails."

played out of style out of rhymes
he's out his mind
lost his way lost his pay
I'm takin' his props so call the cops
you can call 'em but I know 'em
Sweet MCs I think I'll ho 'em
cuz they front so very hard and big or small
I'll break 'em all
Ain't gotta say that I'm the best
my skills will show I passed the test
when it comes to beats and rhymes
we come correctly everytime
and stay tuned

Chorus:

stay tuned...

Verse Two:

with information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
the rest is up to you to choose
the bottom line is win or lose
suckers suckers suckers don't be listening
so I can't be waitin' on 'em
I ain't got no time to play, do you?
look at the state of things and tell me true
in the city any city life's a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
living by the gun or by the rifle
think they got a reason that ain't really sure
the death toll rises more
it's trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
but for a fool I have no pity
there'stoo much suffering too much struggle
too much injustice and don't it bug you
enough for you to press on harder
against the odds the wayn our forefathers
made away but foolishly we go astray
think about it and stay tuned

Chorus

Verse Three:

What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
as my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
just for you to blast around the way
play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting '92 and on
showing how to make a dope rap song
doing this while some disperse
then dissolve like specs of dirt
our music pertains to those who remain
down with the real not wealth or the fame
peace out, we'll be back, stay tuned...

Outro:

Please stay tuned"

sits in his 37th floor suite
and swivels to gaze down
at the city he made me in
he allows me to stand and
sollicit graffiti until
he needs the land i stand on
i in my darkened threshold
am pawing through my pockets
the receipts, the bus schedules
urgent napkin poems
and matchbook phone numbers
all of which laundering has rendered
pulpy and strange
loose change and a key
ask me
go ahead, ask me if i care
i got the answer here
i wrote it down somewhere
i just gotta find it
i just gotta find it

somebody and their spraypaint got too close
somebody came on too heavy
now look at me made ugly
by the drooling letters
i was better off alone
ain't that the way it is
they don't know the first thing
but you don't know that
until they take the first swing
my fingers are red and swollen from the cold
i'm getting bold in my old age
so go ahead, try the door
it doesn't matter anymore
i know the weakhearted are strongwilled
and we are being kept alive
until we're killed
he's up there the ice
is clinking in his glass
i don't ask
i just empty my pockets and wait
it's not fate
it's just circumstance
i don't fool myself with romance
i just live
phone number to phone number
dusting them against my thighs
in the warmth of my pockets
which whisper history incessantly
asking me
where were you

i lower my eyes
wishing i could cry more
and care less,
yes it's true,
i was trying to love someone again,
i was caught caring,
bearing weight

but i love this city, this state
this country is too large
and whoever's in charge up there
had better take the elevator down
and put more than change in our cup
or else we
are coming
up"

When I am walking through the night
Each time I see the visage of the moon
Dead cities amongst the sands
Under the black abyss of seas
Does madness seize my soul?
The elder race
From beyond the stars
Etarnal watchers
Of sphere no return
Seven seals
Of seven mighty gates
Abominations
That come true within ,e
Here's the key by which i can summon the forgotten world
Unnatural desire of the knowledge of the gods
Lust eating up the brain wherein there isn't fear yet
I break the sleep of spectral friends
Tear open the unseen, ghostly screen
Imake free all ways for demons now
And ruin the tombs of sacred souls.....
An epileptic trance is entering my body
To break all control rule of this mind
A boiling braind addicted to madness
In which every night is like a horror dream
Shudder in the dark breath
Old evil blowing icily in the dark
Wrapped in a shroud of mistery
Faint voices from beyond the spaces
Sample a dark universe
Domain of the strange races
With the angry gods
best forgotten and left discovered
You know, of course
I'll be back from the dead
Blessing the blackness in glory
Of billions of years
On collapsed stars
In rituals of the ancient race!"

Harmful, to your heart when you're left all alone

We laughed in the faces of kings never afraid to burn

Here nearly 37 Times

And am I getting through

Get up, get back up
Get up, get back up

I thought I heard you laughing
I thought I heard you scream
I thought I heard some wailing
Like lovers in heat
I thought maybe we'd been


Somewhere that we've never seen
Still you lie so still like
A china doll lost in a summer dream

Here I am way down here
Way down upon my knees
You're looking awfully blue
We were having such a good time
We were having so much fun now
We'll lock the door change the sheets
But how do I get to you

Get back up, get up babe

Are closing in get back up

So pale and so thin
Get back up and make me laugh

Last time I did it was the wrong thing
You make me like country music
You make me doubt that I'm not stupid

But I blacked out some words
It's not worth explaining
Nothing you ain't heard

But you can read my mind

If you couldn't read my mind
I couldn't show you how

191,The Disposable Heroes Of Hiphoprisy,Television The Drug Of The Nation,TRKRRLM128C7196B76,1992,"One Nation under God
has turned into
One Nation under the influence
of one drug

Television, the drug of the Nation
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation

T.V., it satellite links
our United States of unconciousness
Apathetic therapeutic and extremely addictive
the methadone metronome pumping out
a 150 channels 24 hours a day
you can flip through all of them
and still there's nothing worth watching

T.V. is the reason why less than ten percent of our
Nation reads books daily
Why most people think Central America
means Kansas
Socialism means unamerican
and Apartheid is a new headache remedy

absorbed in it's world it's so hard to find us
It shapes our minds the most
maybe the mother of our Nation
should remind us
that we're sitting to close to. . .

Television, the drug of the Nation
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation

T.V. is
the stomping ground for political candidates
Where bears in the woods
are chased by Grecian Formula'd
bald eagles

T.V. is mechanized politic's
remote control over the masses
co-sponsered by environmentally safe gases
watch for the PBS special

It's the perpetuation of the two party system
where image takes precedence over wisdom
Where sound bite politics are served to
the fastfood culture

Where straight teeth in your mouth
are more important than the words
that come out of it
Race baiting is the way to get selected
Willie Horton or
Will he not get elected on . . .

Television, the drug of the Nation
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation

T.V. is it the reflector or the director?
Does it imitate us or do we imitate it
Because a child watches 1500 murders before he's
twelve years old and we wonder how we've created
a Jason generation that learns to laugh
rather than abhor the horror

T.V. is the place where
armchair generals and quarterbacks can
experience first hand
the excitement of video warfare
as the theme song is sung in the background

Sugar sweet sitcoms
that leave us with a bad actor taste while
pop stars metamorphosize into soda pop stars
You saw the video
You heard the soundtrack
Well now go buy the soft drink
Well, the only cola that I support
would be a union C.O.L.A. (Cost of Living Allowance)
On Television.

Television, the drug of the Nation
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation

Back again, ""New and Improved"",
we return to our irregularly programmed schedule
hidden cleverly between heavy breasted
beer and car commericals

CNN ESPN ABC TNT but mostly B.S.
Where oxymoronic language like
""virtually spotless"" ""fresh frozen""
""light yet filling"" and ""military intelligence""
have become standard

T.V. is the place where phrases are redefined
like ""recession"" to ""necessary downturn""
""crude oil"" on a beach to ""mousse""
""Civilian death"" to ""collateral damages""
and being killed by your own Army
is now called ""friendly fire""

T.V. is the place where the pursuit
of happiness has become the pursuit of trivia
Where toothpaste and cars have become sex objects
Where imagination is sucked out of children
by a cathode ray nipple
T.V. is the only wet nurse
that would create a cripple

Television, the drug of the Nation
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation
On Television . . ."

Des manèges à la fête
Vaut mieux pas y penser
Y´a des Jeudi sous la pluie
Des mots d´amour qu´on dit
Faudrait les oublier

C´est du chagrin, d´ la romance
Tous mes souvenirs d´enfance
Y´a qu´ sur les photographies qu´on a l´air d´ s´amuser

L´accordéon
Moi, ça me fait pleurer
Et puis tous ces violons
Je peux pas les écouter
Tous ces p´tits bals de province
Ces fiancés de 15 ans
Faudrait les faire danser

C´est du chagrin, d´la romance
Ces amours adolescentes
Ca t´prend vite un goût de larmes et de baisers volés

Moi j´ donne du rêve à tous les gens qui traînent des souvenirs cassés
D´la dentelle bretonne à ceux qu´ont des habits troués
On a tous partout pareil
Quelque chose à regretter
On s´ frotte les yeux au soleil
Quand nos larmes ont séché

Y´a des rendez-vous d´automne
Dans un café personne
Vaut mieux pas y retourner
On reste tout seul en somme
Avec un téléphone qu´on n´ose plus appeler

Ca t´ bousille toute la tendresse
Quand tu changes tout le temps d´adresse
C´est pas une vie d´être acteur dans une bande dessinée

Moi j´ donne du rêve à tous les gens qui traînent des souvenirs cassés
D´la dentelle bretonne à ceux qu´ont des habits troués
On a tous partout pareil
Quelque chose à regretter
On s´ frotte les yeux au soleil
Quand nos larmes ont séché

Y´a des histoires de retrouvaille
Des regards qui font mal
Vaut mieux pas se regarder
Y´a des trucs qu´on voudrait dire
Des mots-bateaux qu´inspirent
Mais on n´ sait plus parler

Ca t´ fout du blues dans ton âme
De s´appeler Monsieur-Madame
Ca t´ prend au coeur la douleur de l´amour-amitié

Moi j´ donne du rêve à tous les gens qui traînent des souvenirs cassés
D´la dentelle bretonne à ceux qu´ont des habits troués
On a tous partout pareil
Quelque chose à regretter
On s´ frotte les yeux au soleil
Quand nos larmes ont séché

I never knew it 'til then
My friend, my friend

You hold my hand,
You might not say a word
But I see your tears when I show my pain

You're--- my, my friend
I never knew it 'til then
My friend
I feel your love,
When you're not near
It helps me make it knowing you care



The thought of you helps me carryon 
When I feel all hope is gone
I see the world wit brand new eyes
Your love has made me realize
My future looks bright to me, 
Oh because you are my friend
Da, da, da, da (ad lib)

I've been looking around and you were here all the time.

When you shake them
Precious things just shatter 
When you break them

Dreamers don't believe in explanation
Songbirds don't explain their intonation

A little rain may fall around you
Life and all its turns astound you
How you felt when love first found you
How you love to see the blue sky
And to reason why

I can't help believing
In this perfect feeling
Like a dizzy fairground ride
Senses come alive
I'm happy!

Melodies collide with situations
Ecstasy defines its invitation
Sweeter than a fulfilled promise
Beautiful and always honest
How you feel when love surrounds you
How you love to look in her eyes
Something never dies

I can't help believing
In this perfect feeling
Like a dizzy fairground ride
Senses come alive
I'm happy!

Just give in to the madness
The only way to feel your joy
Is to first feel the sadness

Go ahead and sail now
Just give in to the ocean
The only way to tame your fear
Is to feel her rocky motion

You're a long way from somewhere you call home
There's a place in your heart, you're not alone

All of the happiness you seek
All of the joy for which you pray
Is closer than you think
It's just 100 tears away

Go ahead and listen
Just give into the voices
You think you're backed into a corner
But you've got so many choices

You're a long way from some place you feel safe
Peace of mind comes from just one place

All of the happiness you seek
All of the joy for which you pray
Is closer than you think
Is just 100 tears away

You're a long way from somewhere you call home
There's a place in your heart, you're not alone

All of the happiness you seek
All of the joy for which you pray
Is closer than you think
Is just 100 tears away

Whatever it is that'll make you feel good
You can have if you want, if you knew that you could

Is closer than you think
Is just 100 tears away"

By the other's selfish rage 
She made love 
She didn't get laid 
She made love 
She didn't get laid 

And the drum was always going 
When the beer was free and flowing 
Reminiscing of the wild times, the wild times 
Reminiscing of the wild times, the wild times 

Well she was hot 
A hot girl, hot night 
Yeah she was hot 
All right 

Lyin' fucked up on the floor 
Yeah she was fucked up on the floor 
She put her head into the pain, into the pain 
She put her head into the pain, into the pain 
And then she pulled back, the bloody remains 

Well she was hot

Yeah she was hot 
Well all right"
198,Alison Krauss / Union Station,New Fool,TRCNDLS12903CAC8D5,1992,"Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart
Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered
You'll learn your lesson well
When you finally play a heart that plays for real

There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old-fashioned heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new some way

Leaving was so easy
But old hands do make fancy moves
And I for one fell victim to your game
But someday you'll see that cold hearts can be broken too
What goes 'round must come around your way

There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old-fashioned heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new some way"

I'll always stand and wait for you at night
We will create a world for two
I'll wait for you the whole night through
For you, Lili Marlene
For you, Lili Marlene

Bugler, tonight, don't play the call to arms
I want another evening with her charms
Then we will say good-bye and part
I'll always keep you in my heart
With me, Lili Marlene
With me, Lili Marlene

Give me a rose to show how much you care
Tied to the stem, a lock of golden hair
Surely, tomorrow, you'll feel blue
But then will come a love that's new
For you, Lili Marlene
For you, Lili Marlene

When we are marching in the mud and cold
And when my pack seems more than I can hold
My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light
It's you, Lili Marlene
It's you, Lili Marlene

My love for you renews my might
I'm warm again, my pack is light

I try a little bit of that and more

So tell me why, tell me why
Why you keep your distance

Why do you try to resist
Every time I insist
My love, my love, my love, my love

Do you really want me
Do you really want me

Every time you bring me up
You bring me down
It really breaks my heart
I could never say goodbye
Never stay apart
It's a crime, it's a crime
We can't stay together
Cause I got nothing to hide
I just want you to try
My love, my love, my love, my love

Do you really want me
Do you really want me

That you keep your distance
Why do you try to resist

for whom the world has just begun...."
212,Billie Holiday,Without Your Love,TRJDZSD12903CDAA40,1992,"Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love
Fine sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

I've rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love"

Lyrics: Esposito, Brown, Mason, Olsen


From the cradle to the grave
Lord, how much longer till I'm saved
Eyes once opened, never closed
That's the gateway to your soul
There's no honor ever shown
In every world

We can't hold the secret any longer
(But) I know he'll never tell
I swear he'll never tell

Shadows ragin' on the wall
Sounds of screamin' down the hall
Bonds that break and rules to bend
Will the beatings ever end
Time for sorrow, time for pain
In every world

We can't hold the secret any longer
(But) I know he'll never tell
The night becomes his hell

We can't hold the secret any longer
(But) I know he'll never tell
I swear he'll never tell

We can't hold the secret any longer
(But) I know he'll never tell
The night becomes his hell"

Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

She cries to the heaven above
There is a storm in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes
Hurts like brand-new shoes

There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl
Allelujah !!!
Allelujah !!!

Hurts like brand-new shoes"

Goin' to learn to give
I'm goin' down, down by the sea market side

Just one slip and you tumble down
The ropes wrapped around
Just one slip and you tumble down

Soon begins bewitching me

It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and your glance
Makes this romance too hot to handle
Stars in the night blazing their light
Can't hold a candle to your razzle dazzle

You've got me flying high and wide
On a magic carpet ride full of butterflies inside
I just wanna cry, wanna croon, wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think I'm free as a dove
Old evil moon deep in your eyes blinds me with love"

As promising? the things I do
Really don't seem to lead to you

Away
Chase the clouds away
Chase the clouds away
Chase the clouds away

If you stumble on the way
I'll be there to comfort you
To pick you up when you are down

You know that my aim is true
No matter what the world will do

smokin' weed, 'cause we smoke lots of mad weed all the
time...mad mad mad...so Tre, Tre since we smoke a lot of
mad weed...you got what you want coppenhagen,
give the people buddah...indoe gentlemen...a lovely yell oh
that old boy...you must love the buddah...listen man your
mother's (weed beat) is hip-hop...you gotta (scrosho
bard)...man)

trapped in the cockpit
at forty thousand feet
the sky is the limit
but we superscede
the greed for the speed is like
way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with like
forks and spoons in it
and I'm falling
I'm falling
my heart rapid rushes
death before my eyes
oh why did I trust this
my reactions are repeated
over and over and over
oh it seems like I will never be sober

(get up, pack it in...high...I love gettin' high...Im'a get high
'till I die...can I have a light my brother...where is my bud)

the pipe, the pipe
let's pack the pipe
(x4)

I look in every hip-hop magazine
it seems
that the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
and the common man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance to pass it like Fouts
but his pass is incomplete 'cause I can tell in the smell
to let the dutchie pass me by
to the left catch hell
if I wanted to smoke tobacco I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
because the only itch I have is for the indoe or sens
so don't pass me that mess
or try to even protest
that it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
won't you pack the pipe
and keep it movin' down the line

the pipe, the pipe
let's pack the pipe
(x4)

I got a big ol' blunt
I'm lampin' on my front porch
about to put a torch to it
then Coco said don't do it
please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son
she sent him inside the house meanwhile my Sheri steadily rolled one
(what are you doing (daddy)?)
after the other
then another
'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
so we rolled in the indoe
as if the kid didn't know
he's lookin' through the windoew yo while we tryin' to hide it
to make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
about the bud
now I have to play the part of the advisor
because the bud is just the tasty tantalizer
the bud not the beer 'cause the bud makes me wiser
(figaro)
so I said come're little man
(whatcha want old man)
and with his little hand
he grabbed the pipe
a lesson in buddah blessin'
not too young
just right
so he started blazin'
it was amazin'
my lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
but who am I to deny the kid a try
at nature's little way of sayin' hi?
(thank you old man)
so pack

the pipe, the pipe
let's pack the pipe

twisting turning burning
rings of fire when I come into ya layer
say ya pay yer fare for the fee
I see
the pipe
the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it
I really want to smoke it

I choke it

well where's Quinton, Quinton, Quinton where are you?
yo Quint, Quint come're who got a lighter?...Imani got a
lighter...ah kick somethin' on the mike)

why does your mother smoke pipe
with crack on the inside
she likes to take a bus ride with a (shern) stick in her mouth
preachin' about
what the world's goin' on
I don' know what's up
the bitch smokes
a lotta heron
every day a hard
basehead
I don' know what to say

Who played with the world at the end of a string
But he only loved one single thing and that was just a peanut butter sandwich)

Now his scepter wand his royal gowns his regal throne and golden crowns
Were brown and sticky from the mounds
And drippings from each peanut butter sandwich
His subjects all were silly fools cuz he had passed a royal rule
That all that they could learn in school was how to make a peanut butter sandwich
He would not eat his sovereign steak he scorned his soup and his kingly cake
And told his courtly cook to bake
And nothin' nothin' nothin' but an extra-sticky peanut butter sandwich
And then one day he took a bite and started chewing with delight
But found his mouth was stuck quite tight
From that last bite of peanut butter sandwich
His brother pulled his sister pried the wizard pushed his mother cried
Oh my boy's committed suicide from eating his last peanut utter sandwich
The dentist came and the royal doc the royal plumber banged and knocked
But still those jaws stayed tightly locked oh darn that sticky peanut utter sandwich
The carpenter he tried with pliers the telephone man tried with wires
The firemen they tried with fire but couldn't melt that peanut utter sandwich
With ropes and pulleys drills and coil with steam and lubricating oil
For twenty years of tears and toil they fought that awful peanut bbutter sandwich
Then all his royal subjects came they hooked his jaws with grapplin' chains
And pulled both ways with might and main
Against against that peanut butter sandwich
Each man and woman girl and boy put down their ploughs and pots and toys
And pulled until kerack oh joy they broke right through the peanut utter sandwich
A puff of dust a screech a squeak the kin's jaw opened with a creak
And then in voice so faint and weak the first words that they heard him speak
Were how about a peanut butter sandwich"

You know the hardwood floors and all that penniless rough

Twist your fingers soon as break your back

Bringin' you headaches and all those mental sores
Take a little have some need some for yourself
Like the needy and the greedy always seem by themselves
Well you must be have to be one of these
Hidin' on the shade under your family tree

Didn't I meet you once in a liquor store?

Handing out programs to the family theater
Deprived a role so you don't mistreat her

Cause you miss another time
When all your friends were still divine
Now all of them have gone or changed
Do you still live in angry days?
Do you still live in angry days?

But if you lost someone you love
If your mask is taken off
Does life cut you down to size?
Does it open up your eyes?
Because they all have found their way
As you struggle through your maze
You built those walls of hate
Don't tell me it's too late

She lost both her arms in a wrestling match

I shouldn't have come
No i shouldn't have come
Why did I come, hey! 

The clouds were gathering
And the temperature rising
Be no turning back all my bridges were burned
Then it hit me, jumped up and bit me
Now I'm under your spell I can never return 

This is your paradise
Now you must pay the price
You should have flown
When the coup was blown
Welcome to paradise
Did somebody say ...

There's a coup coming on
There's a coup coming on
There's a coup coming on

254,Blue Rodeo,Western Skies,TRDMZAF128F92C5AF6,1992,"Well I'd rather be
walking through the tall pine trees
high
up above Lake Louise
And I'd rather be
chasing after shooting stars
than waiting for this dumb 503 TTC
I'd like to see
the sun set behind Saddle Mountain
and listen to the wind whisper my name
yea this world and me don't fit
one of us is going to have to quit
oh how I miss those western skies
And I'd rather be
back in the Rocky Mountains
than sitting in some bar on Queen Street
And I'd rather be
walking through the high meadow
than watching the latest war on my TV
So please don't you stand in my way
I just got to get out of this place
if I waste another day
I'm sure the sun will forget my name
Oh how I miss those western skies
oh to see the sunset in her eyes
oh to see the sunshine in her eyes
And I'd rather be
lying by the Bow River
just watching the clouds go by
Yea I'd rather be
anywhere else than here tonight
than stuck in the city
but through the pain
good things will come
after the rain the sun
but that don't mean much to me
stuck in the city
oh how I miss those western skies"

""What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy.""
And when you were born, they looked at you and said,
""What a good girl, what a smart girl, what a pretty girl.""

We've got these chains hanging around our necks
People wanna strangle us with them before we take our first breath
Afraid of change, afraid of staying the same
When temptation calls, we just look away

This name is the hairshirt I wear
And this hairshirt is woven from your brown hair
This song is the cross that I bear
Bear with me, bear with me, bear with me
Be with me tonight
I know that it isn't right...
But be with me tonight

I go to school, I write exams
If I pass, if I fail, if I drop out does anyone give a damn?
And if they do, they'll soon forget
'Cause it won't take much from me to show my life ain't over yet

I wake up scared, I wake up strange
I wake up wondering if anything in my life is ever gonna change
I wake up scared, I wake up strange
And everything around me stays the same

It's the hairshirt I wear
And this hairshirt is woven from, it's woven from, your brown hair
This song is the cross that I bear
Bear with me, bear with me, bear with me
Be with me tonight
I know that it isn't right...
But be with me tonight

I couldn't tell you that I was wrong
Chickened out, grabbed a pen and a paper, sat down and I wrote this song
I couldn't tell you that you were right
So instead I looked in the mirror, I watched TV, laid awake all night

We've got these chains hanging around our necks
People wanna strangle us with them before we take our first breath
Afraid of change, afraid of staying the same
When temptation calls...

This name is the hairshirt I wear
And this hairshirt is woven from, it's woven from, it's woven from hair
This song is the cross that I bear
Bear with me, bear with me, bear with me
Be with me tonight

And when I was born, they looked at me and said,
""What a good boy, what a smart boy, what a strong boy.""
When you were born, they looked at you and said,

I wish I was guessing but I know that I'm right
She walked in the place with a smile on her face
And I wondered why she was alone

Every man watched her as she swayed on by
The way she was looking every woman could cry
Then I saw her sit down with a lawyer
And I knew what was going on

She's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend
She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Is this number 4
Is this number 5
How many husbands has she buried alive
She uses the favors that the good Lord gave her
With the devil's desire

Well I bet she's thinking
She's on top of the world
And I've seen her working
So I'm warning you girls
She's single again
She's got a way with men
But she better get away from mine

'Cause she's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend

Said ""What'cha doin' in Denver?

260,Roger Waters,Watching TV,TRRBYWN128F4267165,1992,"We were watching TV
Watching TV
We were watching TV
Watching TV

In Tiananmen Square
Lost my baby there
My yellow rose
In her bloodstained clothes
She was a short order pastry chef
In a Dim Sum dive on the Yangtze tideway
She had shiny hair
She was the daughter of an engineer
Won't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow rose
In her bloodstained clothes
She had perfect breasts
She had high hopes
She had almond eyes
She had yellow thighs
She was a student of philosophy
Won't you grieve with me
For my yellow rose
Shed a tear
For her bloodstained clothes
She had shiny hair
She had perfect breasts
She had high hopes
She had almond eyes
She had yellow thighs
She was the daughter of an engineer
So get out your pistols
Get out your stones
Get out your knives
Cut them to the bone
They are the lackeys of the grocer's machine
They built the dark satanic mills
That manufacture hell on earth
They bought the front row seats on Calvary
They are irrelevant to me

And I grieve for my sister

We were watching TV
Watching TV
We were watching TV
Watching TV

She wore a white bandanna that said
Freedom now
She thought the Great Wall of China
Would come tumbling down
She was a student
Her father was an engineer
Won't you shed a tear
For my yellow rose
My yellow rose
In her bloodstained clothes
Her grandpa fought old Chiang Kai-shek
That no-good, low-down dirty rat
Who used to order his troops
To fire on the women and children
Imagine that; imagine that
And in the spring of '48
Mao Tse-tung got quite irate
And he kicked that old dictator Chiang
Out of the state of China
Chiang Kai-shek came down in Formosa
And they armed the island of Quemoy
And the shells were flying across the China Sea
And they turned Formosa into a shoe factory
Called Taiwan

And she is different from Cro-Magnon man
She's different from Anne Boleyn
She is different from the Rosenbergs
And from the unknown Jew
She's different from the unknown Nicaraguan
Half superstar, half victim
She's a picture star, conceptually new
And she is different from the Dodo
And from the Kankabono
She's different from the Aztec
And from the Cherokee
She's everybody's sister
She's symbolic of our failure
She's the one in fifty million
Who can help us to be free
Because she died on TV"

That's all I have to say to make the mob swarm like locusts (YEAH!)

Girls try to sweet talk, but bullshit walk
For those who try to hawk I stab clit like a fork
I'm very intelligent, so don't try to play me
Try to press the issue and I'll bust that ass baby

And their dreaming time

Because we've broken down the

And we've blackened up the skies
And we cry 'cause we've got no vision left
While the smoke gets in our eyes
And there's no more time
And the dream is dying

But I love you baby
And I know you and I
Can find a way to heaven
Just like Orion in the sky
He's the long lost hero
He's the guardian of your son
But can he protect us baby
From all the sad things we've done

Now I know there's no sense in hiding
And we can't escape this war
And I have made my peace with dying
Down here on this killing floor
In a world gone blind
Where there's no more time

But I love you baby
And I know by and by
We gonna find a way to heaven
Just like Orion in the sky
He can walk upon the water
He can shine for everyone
But can he protect us baby
From all the sad things we've done

Is it too much to ask in a lifetime
For just one shot at happiness
Do you just have to laugh at the right lines
Until you come face to face
With the looking glass
To be reckoned with the sins of our time

I love you baby
I can see you and I
As we fly away together
Up to Orion in the sky
He's the last of the fallen angels
He's the light of the Southern Cross
Maybe he can take us baby
Back to the paradise we've lost

So I'll see you darlin'
Now fly baby, fly
Down across the Fiji Islands
To where the Seven Sisters cry

For all the sad, sad things

I've boudless energy too. I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky

When I touch your sky, I want my joy to be discreet
Can't seem to to hide the feeling that you knock me from my seat
When I'm talking with my friends, you're the subject every time
I know I bore them but they do it to me sometimes

I've seen you exposed your thoughts are nude
Come on take off your pride baby
You should wash your attittude
I'm sitting here watching you baby
Trying to pretend your cool and calm
Come on now you can tell me baby

Was a jolly happy soul,
With a corncob pipe and a button nose,
And two eyes made of coal.

Frosty the Snowman,
Is a fairytale, they say.
He was made of snow,
But the children know
How he came to life one day.

There must have been some magic in
That old silk they found,
For when they placed it on his head,
He began to dance around!

Oh, Frosty, the Snowman,
Was alive as he could be;
And the children say
He could laugh and play,
Just the same as you and me.

Frosty, clumsy as he can be
See him lopping along!
Off he goes on an icicle spree
With a happy song!

Frosty the Snowman,
Knew the sun was hot that day,
so he said, ""Let's run, and we'll have some fun,
now, before I melt away.""

Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Runnin' here and there,
All around the square,
sayin', ""Catch me if you can.""

He led them down the streets of town,
Right to the traffic cop
And only paused a moment,
when he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Hmm, Frosty the Snowman,
Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye, sayin' ""Don't you cry,
I'll be back again some day.""

Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump
look at Frosty go!
Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump
Over the hills of snow!"

And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Did we fly to the moon too soon
Did we squander the chance
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Have we lost what it takes to advance?
Have we peaked too soon?
If the world is so green
Then why does it scream under a blue moon
We wonder why
If the earth's sacrificed
For the price of it's greatest treasure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

And when we shoot for stars
What a giant step
Have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite"

I'm walkin' mighty close to the edge 

It's not too late to turn around
But I'm feeling quite concerned
One more kiss might take me
Past the point of no return

And all sorts of crazy things

A fourteen-carat ring

You can't tune a radio to heaven
You can't live seven lives
You can't win money at the horses
And you can't fight the armed forces

Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's got to bed

Head [Repeat x4]

You can't feed the hungry
Can't talk Shakespeare to a monkey
You can't stand the bomb
And there's no way to stay calm
You can't sue Buddha for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth
And can't put your finger on the truth

Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's got to bed

Oh, ah

And you can't influence
And you can't influence
And you can't influence
Mmm, let's go to bed

You can't sing underwater
You can't have the boss' daughter
You can't make missiles out of mud
You can't purify bad blood
You can't feed the hungry
You can't pretend to have fun
You can't read a robot's mind
And you can't expect vultures to be kind

Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Let's go to bed
Let's go to bed
Ooh let's go to bed

Do you love your mother
The way I love mine
Expecting nothing of her
'Cause she was changing all the time?
I couldn't take my mother
And I'll never hate my home
But I learned to rock myself, child
And get on (carry me)

Do you feel your mother
The way I feel mine?
I tried to change the nature
But now, I like it, 'cause it's mine
And I let you love me up
And I let you bring me home
And I could go away
But I don't wanna (carry me)

I don't wanna be too smart
I don't wanna talk too fast
I don't wanna look too precious
First impressions never last
There's always complications
Weird vibrations
Frustrations
Have patience (carry me)

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (carry me)

Do you love your mother? (yeah)
'Cause, God, I love mine
In a dream she let me love her
Gotta hand it to my mind
In case you never meet her
I'll tell you what it is
She was lonely like a woman
But she was just a kid (carry me)

Oh, Mama, yeah
What are ya doin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oo (carry me)
Oh
What are ya doin'?
Yeah, yeah, yeah (carry me)
Mama, oo
Oh
Shit
Yeah, oh, yeah (carry me)
Uh-huh, Mama
Don't know what to do (carry me)
Oh
Oh, Ma
In a dream she let me love her
In a dream she let me move her

minding my own news
For everything that someone said
someone else had a different view
I watched the whole thing there
unfold upon my T.V. screen
""A new World Order is on its way""
Well pass the popcorn please
You don't mean to tell me
no one here is going to get hurt
When there's folks at home who
eat dog food they can't afford a shirt
Sure find out real fast who's a sitting duck

Shake your hands and say good luck.  It's a . . .

I cannot believe this stuff.  It's a . . .
Mad mad world
Getting madder every day
Mad mad world
Get involved and they blow you away
Sure find out real fast when you're a sitting duck
That it's a mad mad world

A little man sits up way high
way up above the crowd
Can you make them dance real fast
Can you make them cheer real loud

Money doesn't talk it swears
It sounds like a big machine
A voice on high says you reap what you sow
Just keep your own nose clean

More smoke fills up the air
More toxins up the creek
And that's when the cash it changes hands
so we turn the other cheek
Sure find out real fast just when you've

He walks into the office and
he finds a big pink slip
It says ""You are no longer needed here

he's loaded up for bear

Mistadobalina Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mistadobalina Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mistadobalina Mr. Bob Dobalina

Mistadobalina Mistabobdobalina Mistabobdobalina won't you quit
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat
Take a little tip from the tabloid
Because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a
Brother who could look like Mista Mista Mistadobalina

CHORUS

Ooh ooh Mistadobalina
You thought ya could manipulate
You thought you could fool me
Ooh ooh Mistadobalina
Changes put me on a stump and then he schooled me
Friends can be fraudulent just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip
Then he stole my honeydip
Mistadobalina is a serpent
Don't you agree the little two-tima
Resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake
Or wouldn't disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes
Even though last year they was GQ
Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask all I had to do is ask the heather wall Akwame
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester
Dobalina because ya don't impress me
Dobalina the style of dress is not the key
Dobalina it's all in the mind and the heart
So you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee dobalina"

I've seen the worst of times
'Been around and I've taken my chances
(But) I could never be tied down
Too many questions--not enough answers 

Then I laid eyes on you
I knew right there and then
This would be more than a passing encounter
My fate is bound to yours
I've found a cause right here 

And if this is the last place God made
And yours is the last face I see
Just feeling close to you
That's good enough for me 

We've seen the best of times
We've seen the worst of times
Been through hell and high water together
Diamond bright and tear stained mem'ries
These are the times I'll remember forever 

If you believe in me--like I believe in you
Without a care for the why or the wherefore
I will be there for you
And you'll be there for me 

And If this is the last place God made
And yours is the last face I see
Just feeling close to you
It's good enough for me 

If this is the last place God made
You know it's the only place I want to be
Just feeling close to you
That's good enough for me 

If this is the last place God made
You know it's the only place I want to be
Just feeling close to you 
It's good enough for me"

At least it's gotta be somewhere 
There's a long dark cloud just moving around 
Moving around 
Over nothing town 
And it's always something 
And it's always a touch of the same 
Well, the light is on 
And I have to see you 
But it wasn't glowing 
And it wasn't on 
I'd love to know 
How much it glows 
And it's always something 
And it's always something 
And it's always something, touch of the same 
And it's always something 
And it's always something, touch of the same 
touch of the same, touch of the same"

Lyrics: Mason, Esposito, Brown


You light a fire in the rain
And I feel it burnin'
You swore you'd never hurt again
I remember
Under the spell of a different role
A secret whispered
No one around to keep you home
The night is waiting

You can't resist it
When the darkness       
Calls out your name
You keep insisting
That it's black or white
Show me tonight

Smoking candles light your way
They glow like angels
Words you just don't understand
That can change your future
It's too late to turn back now
Can you fight all your feelings
Frightened little girl you keep inside
But she's left in tears 

You can't resist it
When the darkness       
Calls out your name
You keep insisting
That it's black or white
Show me tonight

Well, there's two sides to living
Oh, it ain't always left or right
But you're only giving
What you're taking out of the night"
299,The Gits,Wingo Lamo,TRGHQYR128F4269092,1992,"When I'm going into the bar,
I'm there trying to ignore
this terror in me, I can't set it free
I can't make any sense
unless it's in a song
and every time I try to feel
I only seem to wake up lifeless
where would it ever end
when we fall to our own demand
It takes up your life
and throws it like dice
each time we fail,
it never gets over looked
When you're thinking that the cards lay forward
it takes up your answers
with no second chances
Immobilized by the torment
it hits so hard, there's nothing more I can take
Needing each breath just to make it through
there's nothing more I'm expected to do
there's nothing worse than hating yourself
and parading around like you're somebody else
I wish that it would just all go to hell
Wanting some time just to be by myself"
