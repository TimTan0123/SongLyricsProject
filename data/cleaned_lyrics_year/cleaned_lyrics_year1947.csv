0,Billie Holiday,I'll Look Around,TRHGRJB128F427FDBD,1947,"I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you

I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear
I look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Won't be the old love I always knew"
1,Billie Holiday,There Is No Greater Love,TRDPPGU128F92FE2EB,1947,"There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than that you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you"
2,Dinah Shore,Buttons And Bows,TRMUKIY12903CD7C60,1947,"East is east and west is west
And the wrong one I have chose
Let's go where I'll keep on wearin'
Those frills and flowers and buttons and bows
Rings and things and buttons and bows

Don't bury me in this prairie
Take me where the cement grows
Let's move down to some big town
Where they love a gal by the cut o' her clothes
And I'll stand out in buttons and bows

I'll love you in buckskin
Or skirts that I've homespun
But I'll love you longer, stronger where
Your friends don't tote a gun

My bones denounce the buckboard bounce
And the cactus hurts my toes
Let's vamoose where gals keep usin'
Those silks and satins and linen that shows
And I'm all yours in buttons and bows

(Silks and satins and linen that shows)
(And I'm all yours in buttons and bows)

Gimme eastern trimmin' where women are women
In high silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes
And French perfume that rocks the room
And I'm all yours in buttons and bows

Buttons and bows
Buttons and bows
(Frills and flowers and buttons and bows)
(Rings and things and buttons and bows)"
3,"Eddie ""Cleanhead"" Vinson",Kidney Stew Blues,TRBDVYQ128F92D631E,1947,"Crazy about you baby, but I just ain't got the price
Crazy about you baby, but I just ain't got the price
You're a high class mama, so I guess it ain't no dice

Goin' back home, and get my old gal Sue
Goin' back home, and get my old gal Sue
She ain't the caviar kind, just plain old kidney stew

Old kidney stew, old kidney stew is fine
Old kidney stew, old kidney stew is fine
You can save your money, and keep your peace of mind"
4,Frank Sinatra,Time After Time,TREBTJO128F1499B40,1947,"What good are words I say to you?
They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you"
5,Frank Sinatra,Embraceable You,TRDKKRJ12903CB1727,1947,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want these arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

So don't you be a naughty baby
Come to papa do
My sweet embraceable you"
6,Gene Autry,Here Comes Santa Claus,TRQZDUJ128F92EA877,1947,"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, oh what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor, he loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows we're all God's children, that makes everything right
So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when chimes ring out that it's Christmas morn' again
Peace on Earth will come to all if we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to the lord above, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers, 'cause Santa Claus comes tonight"
7,Hank Williams,I Saw the Light,TRBCCXT128F9341987,1947,"I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light.

I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light."
8,Leon Payne,Lost Highway,TRSNZHB12903CDD5C4,1947,"I'm a rollin' stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway

For a deck of cards and a jug of gin
And a woman's lies built this road of sin
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
Started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a guy like you
Now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I take the cost on the lost highway

Now boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You paid the price on the lost highway"
9,Merle Travis,Nine Pound Hammer,TRHSPGF128F426977A,1947,"This nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, baby, for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
But I ain't comin' back, well, I ain't comin' back

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Tell me, how can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
Now, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?

It's a long way to Harlan, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Well, when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal, outta number nine coal

Hey, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull your load of coal
Tell me, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?"
10,Merle Travis,Sixteen Tons,TRAVHUC128F429B62B,1947,"Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said: ""Well, a-bless my soul!""

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store"
11,Tex Williams,Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette),TRCSANG12903CC893F,1947,"Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
The kind of fellow that wouldn't even harm a flee

But if me and a certain character met
The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son-of-a-gun in the first degree

Cause, it ain't cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon into your health
I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop while they smoke the cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

In a game of chance the other night
Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
The kings and the queens just kept on comin' around

I got a full and I bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept on raisin' and layin' that money down

He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
He finally called, didn't raise the bet

I said ""aces full pal, how 'bout you?""
He said ""I'll tell you in just a minute or two
Right now, I just gotta have myself a cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had me a date
With the cutest little gal on East 50 States
One 'em high-bred, uptown, fancy little dames

She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That everything's were like it oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
Our smoochin' party was goin' real nice
So help me, Hannah I'm thinking I've been there yet

I give her a kiss, a little squeeze
She said, ""Tex, excuse me please
But I just gotta have a filtered cigarette""

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've just gotta have another cigarette"
12,The Mills Brothers,Across the Alley from the Alamo,TRMUSYS128F933A26D,1947,"Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian ""Hi-de-ho""
To the people passin' by

The pinto spent his time a-swishin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passin' by

One day, they went a-walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not a-lookin'
Toot, toot, they never came back

Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian ""Hi-de-ho""
To the people passin' by

Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto a-pony and a Navajo
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough
For the people passin' by

They thought that they would make some easy bucks
By washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux
A pair of very conscientious clucks
To the people passin' by

Then they took this cheap vacation
Their shoes were polished bright
Though they never heard the whistle
Toot, toot, they're clear out of sight

Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the starlight beams its tender glow
The beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough
For the people passin' by

One day, they went a-walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not a-lookin'
Toot, toot, they never came back

Oh, across the alley from the Alamo
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian ""Hi-de-ho""
To the people passin' by

Across the alley from the Alamo"
