0,Betty Hutton,It's Oh So Quiet!,TRWXSDC128F429ADBE,1955,"Shh! Shh!
It's oh so quiet.
Shh! Shh!
It's oh so still.
Shh! Shh!
You're all alone.
Shh! Shh!
And so peaceful until

You fall in love!
Zing boom!
The sky up above
Zing boom!
Is caving in!
Wham bam!
You've never been so nuts about a guy.
You want to laugh, you want to cry.
You cross your heart and hope to die.

It's over and then
Shh! Shh!
It's nice and quiet.
Shh! Shh!
But soon again
Shh! Shh!
Starts another big riot.

You blow a fuse.
Zing boom!
The devil cuts loose.
Wham bam!
So what's the use
Wham bam!
Of falling in love?

Shh! Shh!
It's oh so quiet.
Shh! Shh!
It's oh so still.
Shh! Shh!
You're all alone.
Shh! Shh!
And so peaceful until

You ring the bell
Bim bam!
You shout and you yell:
Oh oh!
You broke the spell.
Gee this is swell,
You almost have a fit.
This guy is George and I got hit.
There's no mistake
Cause this is it!

Till it's over and then
Shh! Shh!
It's nice and quiet.
Shh! Shh!
But soon again
Shh! Shh!
Starts another big riot.

You blow a fuse.
Zing boom!
The devil cuts loose.
Wham bam!
So what's the use
Wham bam!
Of falling in love?

The sky caves in.
The devil cuts loose.
You blow blow blow blow your fuse,
When you've fallen in love!
Shh! Shh!"
1,Betty Hutton,Doctor_ Lawyer Indian Chief,TRFYMWW128F429ADB5,1955,"There's a doctor living in your town. 
There's a lawyer and an Indian too.
But neither doctor, lawyer, nor Injun chief could love you any more than I do.
There's a barrel of fish in the ocean.
There's a lot of little birds in the blue.
But neither fish nor foul says the wise old owl 
Could love you any more than I do.

No, no, no it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do.
I'm gonna warn all the dead-eye dicks
That you're the chick with the slickest tricks.
And every tick of my ticker ticks for you,
Follow through.

Tell the doc to stick to his practice.
Tell the lawyer to settle his case.
Send the Injun chief and his Tommy- hawk back to little Rain-in-the-Face.
Oh you know know know it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do.

No, no, no, it couldn't be true 
That anyone else could love you like I do.
And confidentially I confess.
I sent a note to the local press 
That I'll be changing my home address
For you, follow through.

Tell the doc to stick to his practice.
Tell the lawyer to settle his case.
Send the Injun chief and his Tommy- hawk back to little Rain-in-the-Face.
Cause you know know know it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do.
No, no, no it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do. 
I'm going to send a hot communique
To the boys down in Cripple Creek
That every dimple on your dimpled cheek
Is mine, so to speak.

Tell the doc to stick to his practice.
Tell the lawyer to settle his case.
Send the Injun chief and his Tommy-hawk back to little Rain-in-the-Face.

Cause you know know know it couldn't be true
That anyone else could love you like I do.
Like I do.
Like I do.
Like I do.
Like I do!"
2,Betty Hutton,She's A Lady (with Perry Como),TRTPIQH128F429ADB8,1955,"She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady!
She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady!
She's as quiet as a mouse
Why, she would never ever raise her voice to a shout
Not unless somebody else is drownin' me out!

Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady!
High floutin' ~ You're darn tootin'!
And her manners are superb
Yesterday I wore a gown of satin an' lace,
You took me out dinin' to the ritziest place
And when they brought the finger bowl,
Why you washed your face!
Ah! I'm a Lady! ~ She's a Lady ~ Oh yeah!

He's a Lover! ~ I'm a Lover!
He's big hearted! ~ Once I've started!
Nothin' is good for you!
Say, how do you mean that?
I bought you a golden necklace fit for a Queen
If that's a golden necklace, why's my neck turnin' green?

He's Romantic! ~ I'm Romantic!
He's the shy type! ~ Yes, it's my type!
He's the kind that girls can't trust!
Some guys take a girl out ridin' an' when they do,
She may have to walk home, that don't happen to you!
That's because I take them riding in a canoe
Oh! He's a lover! ~ I'm a lover ~ Oh yeah!

She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady!
She's the fine type ~ Home at nine type!
She's as gentle as a lamb!
She's the most refined girl that the city has got
I will beat up anyone who says that I'm not!

She's a High-Brow ~ I'm a High-Brow!
You're what 'class' is! ~ You need glasses!
You know just how things are done
In a crowded bus, you find a guy with a seat
Then you drop your hanky so it lands at his feet
When he stands up to get it, that's when I grab his seat!
Yes, She's a Lady ~ I'm a Lady! ~ Oh yeah!

He's a Singer! ~ I'm a Singer!
Like Caruso! ~ Learned to do so,
In a barber-shop quartet
I once gave a hair-cut to a fellow one day
I started singing ""Mammy"" an' kept cutting away
Yeah, now they call him 'baldy' an' he wears a toupee!

You're a Lady! ~ You're a Barber!
You're a High-Brow! ~ You're a Sin-ger!
Hee hee, I'm a Sin-ger? ~ Ha, ha ha ha!
She's a Lady ~ Ah! He's a Sin-ger! ~ Oh yeah!

3,Betty Hutton,Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad,TRKZGFO128F429ADD7,1955,"I've got a guy, I like him fine
But he takes me for granted all of the time
To teach him a lesson and make him mad,
I went out on a date with the best friend he had
That made him mad boy, hot dog, that made him mad
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again

Oh, late last night when I came in, he demanded to know just where I'd been
But I really put him right in his place
Instead of an answer, I laughed in his face
That made him mad boy, hot dog, that made him mad
So he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again

He said my heart is on my sleeve, and if I didn't change that he would leave
Well, you shoulda seen him, was his face red,
when I laughed and told him just go right ahead
That made him mad boy, hot dog, that made him mad
So he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again

Well, the moral is, to play it cool
Let your guy know you're nobody's fool
When he gets to thinking you're all his own,
Let him know that you can take him or leave him alone
That makes him mad boy, hot dog, that makes him mad
And he'll hug you and he'll kiss you and he'll ask you not to do it again

Yeah, he'll hug you and he'll kiss you
He'll squeeze you and he'll please you
And he'll ask you not to do it again"
4,Big Maybelle,Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,TRJQDHH12903CC9292,1955,"When there one drum
I'm an old bass hun
An' someone beatin' on a ding dong

Come on over baby
Whole lotta shakin' going on
Come on over baby
Baby you can't go wrong
Ain't nobody faking
Whole lotta shakin' going on

Come on over baby
Whole lotta kickin' in the barn
Come over baby, baby

Shakin' we shakin' and shakin' the place
Come on over, baby, come on
We done found that ding dong

Come on over baby

Cake then found the plate
Makin' it, makin' it shake
Shakin' in the jams, (but case)
Sweet, oh, baby come on..."
5,Big Maybelle,One Monkey Don't Stop No Show,TRDBPPR128F42394FB,1955,"You wanna get rich you got to get out and dig
You want long hair go buy yourself a wig
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
It's a real true sayin', ""One monkey won't stop no show"".

You can live in the country
You can come to town
What goes up
Is bound to come down
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Well pick up on what I'm sayin', ""One monkey won't stop no show"".

You can travel by bus
You can come by train
Travel by thumb
But you will get there just the same
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Yeah, dig what I'm sayin', ""One monkey won't stop no show"".

You don't have to be rich
Now to have plenty friends
Keep some cash on hand
If you pay off in the end
Please believe me, gonna tell it to you slow
Pick up on what I'm sayin', ""One monkey won't stop no show""."
6,Bill Haley & His Comets,Burn That Candle,TRZWJOK128F932F935,1955,"Keep that candle burning bright, 
Mother,
I'll be kind of late tonight, mother,
There's a yellow moon above, mother,
Shining on the one I love, mother.

Burn that candle, night and day,
Burn that candle, light our way,
Keep that doorway open wide,
Until we come slowly strolling, 
Side by side.

While that candle's burning high, 
Mother,
I'll be with my sugar pie, mother,
We'll be coming home, you know, 
Mother,
Looking for that candle glow, mother.

After we have had the wedding, mother,
To that candle we'll be heading, 
Mother,
So before we'll wine and dine, mother,
Start that candle light a' shining, 
Mother.

Burn that candle, night and day,
Burn that candle, light our way,
Keep that doorway open wide,
Until we come slowly strolling, 
Side by side.

'Til I'm strolling through that doorway, 
With my bride."

I got a rock, rock, rocking chair on the moon
Oh, rock away my troubles, rock away my blues
In my rocking chair on the moon

When the moon is shining, shining from above
Shining on the couples, all a-making love

Just friends, but not like before

We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died"

Until you’ve learned the meaning of the blues
Until you’ve loved a love you had to loose
You don’t know what love is

You don’t know how lips hurt
Until you’ve kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you’ve flipped you’re heart and you have lost
You don’t know what love is

Do you know how lost hearts fear
The thought of reminiscing
And how lips tasting of tears
Loose the taste for kissing

You don’t know how hearts yearn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you’ve faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
How could you know what love is"

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coup De Ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side to side

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've just started back doing the things you used to do

The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and it started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

You've started back doing the things you used to do

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?

You've just started back doing the things you used to do

The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten, a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

If your love was ever true

In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
I wonder if you still remember
All the things we used to do

The only one for me"

A million or more times?

I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Si spengono i rumori 
Si spegne anche l'insegna 
Di quel'ultimo caffè 
Le strade son deserte 
Desterte e silenzione
Un'ultima carrozza 
Cigolando se ne và

Il fiume scorre lento 
Frusciando sotto i ponti 
La luna slende in cielo 
Dorme tutta la città 
Solo và un'uomo in frack

Ha il cilindro per cappello 
Due diamanti per gemelli 
Un bastone di cristallo 
La gardenia nell'occhiello 
E sul candido gilet 
Un papillon, 
Un papillon di seta blu 
S'avvicina lentamente 
Con incedere elegante 
Ha l'aspetto trasognato 
Malinconico ed assente 
Non si sa da dove vien 
Ne dove và 
Chi mai sarà 
Quel'uomo in frack

Buon nuite bonne nuite 
Buon nuite bonne nuite 

Bouna notte 
Va dicendo ad ogni cosa 
Ai fanali illuminati 
Ad un gatto innamorato 
Che randagio se ne va

E' giunta ormai l'aurora 
Si spengono i fanali 
Si sveglia a poco a poco 
Tutta quanta la città 
La luna s'è incantata 
Sorpresa ed impallidita 
Pian piano 
Scolorandosi nel cielo sparirà 
Sbadiglia una finestra 
Sul fiume silenzioso 
E nella luce bianga 
Galleggiando se ne van 
Un cilindro 
Un fiore e un frack. 

Galleggiando dolcemente 
E lasciandosi cullare 
Se ne scende lentamente 
Sotto i ponti verso il mare 
Verso il mare se ne và 
Chi mai sarà, chi mai sarà 
Quell'uomo in frack

Adieu adieu adieu adieu 
Addio al mondo 
Ai ricordi del passato 
Ad un sogno mai sognato 
Ad un'attimo d'amore 
Che mai più ritornerà"
22,Doris Day,Secret Love,TRMQUAB128F428B4EC,1955,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore"

But the boys in the band just smiled,
Heard it all before,

And as they're starting to serve champagne,
To the folks at the front of the plane,
I can hear the engines roaring, we're on our way, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight... The movie reminds of my lady,
As she waits, ""where are those guys?""
Yes it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky,

And now the sun is beginning to rise,
It's like looking down on Paradise,
There's a ball of fire that's burning, giving life, And we are flying home,
I feel the freedom in my soul,
Flying home at last;
Flying home,
I've got the freedom in my soul,
And it's four in the morning,
My world is calling,
Speeding through the universe tonight..."
24,Ella Fitzgerald,How High The Moon,TRPEMNN12903CDF512,1955,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How high the moon
is the name of this song
How high the moon
Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it 
Because you ask for it
So we're swinging it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars
How high the moon
Does it reach up to Mars
Though the words may be wrong
to this song
We're asking how high, high, high
high, high is the moon

But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes"

Always hear, when you sigh,
never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
in a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Lullaby, Lullaby

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow

That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love"

You play the same love song - it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning - just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson - in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light - one after another
Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you - constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor - and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break - you're learnin' the (those) blues"

A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray 
Some one will come to show the way
I believe,  I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer 
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere 
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry 
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
I believe, I believe

I believe the lord in heaven  he is my guide 
My sins he'll hide 
I believe on calvary that jesus died 
That pierced side 
I believe in death we'll part to rise again
And meet in heaven to that loud amen
Then I know why, I believe."
34,Frankie Laine,Granada,TRLUAHT128F933B7B6,1955,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell,
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today. 

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song. 

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,
Romantic and gay."

When tears come down, like falling rain 
You'll toss around and call my name 
You'll walk the floor the way I do 
Your cheating heart will tell on you
Your cheating heart will pine someday 
And crave the love you threw away 
The time will come when you'll be blue

Till one day the angels they called her that debt we all have to pay
And she'd call me close to her bedside these last few words to say

Son don't start drinking and gambling promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting that promise I've broke I must say
I started in gambling for past time and then I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money not dreaming that I'd ever fall

One night I've bet all my money nothing was left to be seen
All I needed to break them was one card and that was a Queen
The cards were delt round the table each man took a card on the draw
And I drew the card that would beat them I turned it here's what I saw

I saw mother's picture and somehow she seemed to say
Son you roken your promise so I threw those cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy I knew I was wrong from the start

From the love I had I'm feelin' mighty bad and I can't go on this way

Cause my rudder's broke and it ain't no joke won't you reach and pull me in

Well, I'm sittin' here on the back porch, don't know which way to go
The gal that I'm so crazy about, she don't love me anymore

And home I go

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me

He heard a light
And gentle voice behind him say:

Where you go, my heart goes with you.
Matelot, Matelot,
When you go down to the sea.
For a year and a day 
You may sail away,

Yet through the wind and the spray 
You will hear me say,
""No love was ever free.""
You will sigh when horizons appear,
""Something that is dear 
To me
Cannot let me be.""

Where you go, my heart goes with you.

Could not resist
This loving, roving rover.

Ever pursued a new love,
'Til in his brain
He heart a strain
He knew to be his true love
Song:

'Matelot, Matelot,
Where you go, my heart will follow.
Matelot, Matelot,
When you go down to the sea.
When there's grief in the sky
And the waves fly by,
My heart to yours will say,
""You can be sure that I'm true
To my love for you,
Though half a world away.""
Never mind
If you find
Other charms.
Here within my arms,
You'll sleep,
Sailor from the deep.

The candles gutter, the starlight leaves the sky;
It's time for little boys and girls to hurry home to bed,
For there's a new day waiting just ahead.

Life is sweet,
But time is fleet
beneath the magic of the moon.
Dancing time
May seem sublime,
But it ended all too soon.

The thrill has gone,
To linger on
Might spoil it anyhow;
Let's creep away
From the day,
For the party's over now."
63,Noel Coward,Mad Dogs and Englishmen,TRZYLAU128F92D30FD,1955," As recorded in London, September 20, 1932

In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire
To take their clothes off and perspire.
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey,
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultry-violet ray.

The natives grieve when the white men leave their huts
Because they're obviously definitely nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun,
The Japanese don't care to, 
The Chinese wouldn't dare to.
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one,
But Englishmen detest a siesta.

In the Philipines 
They have lovely screens 
To protect you from the glare.
In the Malay States 
There are hats like plates 
Which the Britishers won't wear.
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done,
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun.

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, 
They're quite impervious to heat.
When the White Man rides every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he 
Will impale his solar topee on a tree.

It seems such a shame 
when the English claim 
the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
He-he-he-he-he-he-he
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun.
The toughest Burmese bandit 
Can never understand it.
In Rangoon the heat of noon 
Is just what the natives shun,
They put their Scotch or Rye down 
And lie down.

In a jungle town 
Where the Sun beats down 
To the rage of man and beast
The English garb 
Of the English sahib 
Merely gets a bit more creased.
In Bangkok 
At twelve o'clock 
They foam at the mouth and run,
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun.

Mad dogs and Englshmen go out in the midday sun.
The smallest Malay rabbit 
Deplores this foolish habit.
In Hong Kong 
They strike a gong 
And fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate
Who's in late.

In the mangorve swamps 
Where the python romps 
There is peace from twelve till two.
Even caribous
Lie around and snooze, 
For there's nothing else to do.
In Bengal 
To move at all 
Is seldom if ever done,
But mad dogs and Englishmen go—
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday,
Out in the midday sun.

64,Noel Coward,World Weary,TRIPULZ128F930D7F1,1955,"As recorded at Las Vegas in June, 1955

When I'm feeling weary and blue, I'm only too
Glad to be left alone
Dreaming of a place in the sun when day is done
Far from a telephone
Hardly ever see the sky
Buildings seem to grow so high
Give me somewhere peaceful and grand 
Where all the land
Slumbers in monotone

I'm world weary, world weary, living in a great big town
I find it so dreary, so dreary
Everything looks grey or brown
I want an ocean blue
Great big trees
Bird's eye view of the Pyrenees
I wanna watch the moon rise up 
See the great red sun go down
Watching clouds go by through a windy sky fascinates me
But if I do it in the street every cop I meet simply hates me
Because I'm world weary, world weary
Tired of all these jumping jacks
I wanna get right back to nature and relax

I'm world weary, world weary, living in a great big town.
I find it so dreary, so dreary,
Everything looks grey or brown.
I want a horse and plow, chickens too,
Just one cow with a wistful moo,
A country where the verb ""to work""
Becomes a most improper noun
I can hardly wait till I see the great open spaces.
My loving friends will not be there I'm so sick of their damned fool faces
Because I'm world weary, world weary, 
I could kiss the railroad tracks,
I wanna get right back to nature,
Assume a horizontal stature,
I wanna get right back to nature and relax."
65,Noel Coward,Alice Is At It Again,TRDTWNH128F4294C70,1955,"In a dear little village,
Remote and obscure
A beautiful maiden resided.
As to whether or not 
Her intentions were pure,
Opinions were sharply divided.
She loved to lie
Out 'neath the darkening sky,
And allow the night breeze 
To entrance her,
She whispered her dreams 
To the birds flying by
But seldom received any answer.

Over the field and along the lane
Gentle Alice would love to stray.
When it came to the end of the day,
She would wander away,
Unheeding.
Dreaming her innocent dreams she strode,
Quite unaffected by heat or cold,
Frequently freckled or soaked with rain,
Alice was out in the lane.

Who she met there
Every day
Was a question
Answered by none,
But she'd get there,
And she'd stay there,
'Til whatever she did
Was undoubtedly done.

Over the field and along the lane
Both her parents would call in vain,
Sadly, sorrowfully, they'd complain,
'Alice is at it again.'

Although that dear little village,
Surrounded by trees,
Had neither a school, nor a college,
Gentle Alice acquired
From the birds and the bees,
Some exceedingly practical knowledge.
The curious secrets that nature revealed,
She refused to allow to upset her,
But she thought,
When observing the beasts of the field,
That things might have been organised better.

Over the field and along the lane,
Gentle Alice would make up
And take up
Her stand.
The road was not exactly arterial,
But it led to a town nearby,
Where quite a lot of masculine material
Caught her rolling eye.

She was ready to hitchhike,
Cadillac or motorbike,
She wasn't proud or choosy.
All she
Was aiming to be
Was a pinked-up,
Minked-up,
Fly-by-night floozy.

When old Rogers
Gave her pearls as large as
Nuts on a chestnut tree,
All she'd say was
'Fiddle-di-dee!
The wages of sin will be the death of me!'

Over the field and along the lane,
Gentle Alice's parents
Would wait,
Hand in hand.
Her dear old white-headed mother,
Wistfully sipping champagne,
Said 'We've spoiled our child,
Spared the rod.
Open up the caviar and say ""Thank God!""
We've got no cause to complain!
Alice is at it again!'"

75,The Platters,I'm Just a Dancing Partner,TRAGLAE12903CDF2CB,1955,"Am I just another
Dancing partner?
Do you smile
At every boy this way?

Do you hold them all until
They're breathless?
Do you always find
Nice things to say?

When this dance is over
Will you dance with me once more?
My heart tells me you're
The love I'm longing for

If I'm just another
Dancing partner
Then I wish this dance
Would never end

When this dance is over
Will you dance with me once more?
My heart tells me you're
The love I'm longing for

If I'm just another
Dancing partner
Then I wish this dance
Would never end"
