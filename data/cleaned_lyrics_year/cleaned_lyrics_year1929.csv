0,Annette Hanshaw,I Have To Have You,TRGIISJ12903CEC992,1929,"Lovin, I have to have lovin 
But when I'm having my lovin 
I have to have you 

Moments, I have to have moments 
But when I'm having my moments 
I have to have you 

Sometimes I get so blue 
Waiting for you to take me 
I can't go on like this, 
Give me a kiss 
And make me happy 

New thrills, I have to have new thrills 
But when I'm having my new thrills 
I have to have you 

Weekends, I have to have weekends, 
But when I'm taking my weekends 
I have to have you 

Night boats, I hate to take night boats 
But if I have to take night boats 
I have to take you"
1,Bessie Smith,Don't Cry Baby,TRZFMWS128F426C169,1929,"Honey, please don't cry, listen to me
There's no reason why we shouldn't agree
If I hurt your feeling, I apologize
You're the only one that I idealize

Don't cry, baby, don't cry, baby
Dry your eyes and let's be sweethearts again
I didn't mean to make you feel blue
Honest, I'd never do it again

Won't you forgive, won't you forget, do as I ask you to
I never let you regret, just start a new
You know I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Don't cry baby, there's no one but you

Don't cry, baby, don't cry, baby
Dry your eyes and let's be sweethearts again
I didn't mean to make you feel blue
Honest, I'll never do it again

Won't you forgive, won't you forget, do as I ask you to
I never let you regret, just start a new
You know I'm sorry, oh, so sorry
Don't cry, baby, there's no one but you"
2,Bessie Smith,Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out,TRPJNKI128F93401BE,1929,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, didn't have any care
Took all my friends out for a mighty good time
Bought bootleg whisky, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out

When you finally get back upon your feet again
Everybody wants to be your good old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you
Nobody knows you when you're down and out"
3,Bessie Smith,He's Got Me Goin',TRKWIWK128F426BB63,1929,"Don't know what come over me,
Done lost my self control;
He's the sugar in my tea,
The jelly in my roll!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Gee, I've got a lovin' man,
One o' them handsome brutes,
He's built 'ccordin' to a plan,
Too bad when it suits.

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

I can't sleep a doggone wink
Unless he's by my side;
Mind's so different I just can't think
Without my easy ride!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Lay and listen to the clock,
Ticks loud as a drum,
Hear the crowing of a cock,
Still my man ain't come!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Wouldn't be no two-time gal,
Just one man's enough,
I don't need no two men 'cause
My one man knows his stuff!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

Got a heart for just one man,
Knows how to get to it,
For he's got the only key
That's the perfect fit!

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!

'Fraid to adverise my man,
Simply scared to death!
He's xxxxx by him,
And tryin' for there self.

Got me goin',
He's got me goin',
But I don't know where I'm headed for!"

Because my man he mistreated me, Lord he have done me wrong

The man that I'm a-loving, Lord he going get me killed
The man that I'm a-loving, Lord he going get me killed
Because love is a proposition, that's got many a poor girl killed

I woke up this morning, feeling mighty bad
Ohh, feeling mighty bad
I done lost my daddy, best man I ever had

It's your time now, be mine after a while
Oh, be mine after a while
You know that you hurt me, daddy because I seen you smile

My mama's dead, papa throwed me away from home
Oh, papa throwed me away from home
My man don't want me, that's why I weep and moan

If you don't want me, please don't dog me around
Oh, please don't dog me around

The little girl about four feet four, come on papa and

I went out and walked around, somebody yelled, said,

Went to church, put my hand on the seat, lady sat on it

Mister Diddie Wa Diddie

I wish somebody would tell me what Diddie Wa Diddie means

I said, ""Sister, I'll soon be gone, just gimme that

7,Blind Blake,Sweet Jivin' Mama,TRJFPDU128F427F905,1929,"Did you ever know a woman with a red ....... smile
Did you ever know a woman with a red ....... smile
Sometimes you thought she ought to be buried alive

When a woman act right she's sweet as sweet can be
When a woman act right she's sweet as sweet can be
A sweet talking woman made a chump out of me

I got a sweet woman, she sure got me on the floor
I got a sweet woman, she sure got me on the floor
She hears me coming, get her husband out of doors

Sweet jivin' mama, make a man done gone and...
Sweet jivin' mama, make a man done gone and...
But a jivin' woman, make a man...

8,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Pneumonia Blues,TRUDNZU12903CAF55B,1929,"Achin's all over, believe I've got the pneumonia this time
I'm achin' all over, believe I've got the pneumonia this time
And it's all on account of that low-down gal of mine

Sneakin' 'round the corners, runnin' up alleys, too
I say, I'm sneakin' 'round corners and runnin' up alleys, too
Watchin' my woman, tryin' to see what she gon' do

Stood out in the street one cold, dark stormy night
I stood out in the street one dark and stormy night
Try and see if my good gal gon' make it home all right

I believe she's found something, that probably made her fall
She must've found something, and I believe it's made her fall
I've stood out in the cold all night and she didn't come home at all

Wearin' BVDs in the winter, prowlin' round in the rain
Wearin' BVDs in the winter and prowlin' round in the rain
Runnin' down my baby give me this pneumonia pain

Now, when I die, bury me in a Stetson hat
I say, when I die, bury me in a Stetson hat
Tell my good gal I'm gone, but I'm still a-standin' pat"
9,Blind Willie McTell,Drive Away Blues,TRUOSVX12903CEC905,1929,"I believe that if I had my sweet woman's heart, in my hand, in my hand
I believe that if I had my sweet woman's heart, in my hand, in my hand
I believe I could teach her, how to treat a real good man

I drink so much whiskey mama, I can't hardly talk, hardly talk, sweet mama hardly talk
I drink so much whiskey mama, I can't hardly talk, hardly talk
Well it's done addled on my brain, people I can't hardly walk

How my poor heart weeped and worried, baby when you drove me away, sweet mama drove me away
How my poor heart weeped and worried, baby when you drove me away
It was crying for poor boy McTell, some old rainy day

Climbing on the Lookout Mountain, look dived in Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, sweet mama Niagara Falls 
Climbing on the Lookout Mountain, look dived in Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls
Seem like to me, I can hear my Atlanta mama call

Don't grieve and worry, and don't fret after me, after me
Don't fret and worry, and don't grieve after me, after me
Don't you scream and cry, because I'm going back to Tennessee

Can't read and write, can't even spell my name, spell my name
Can't read and write, can't even spell my name
You drove me away, and drove my heart insane"
10,Blind Willie McTell,Love Changing Blues,TRKVUJW128F421EE29,1929,"My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing
My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing done
And if I backbite you
I don't mean no harm

What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a rooster
When he won't crow 'fore day

If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
And if I take you woman
I just be made my run

Going in one of these alleys
Get me some lonesome booze
Going in one of these alleys
Get me a quart of this lonesome booze
My woman done left me
I got these love changing blues"

If you having family troubles and your woman's of a fussy kind
