0,Beginner,Scheinwerfer,TRIMSDJ128F92F44D2,2003,"Hamburg zwei-null-null-drei
Es ist dunkel hier, aber manche haben Scheinwerfer.
Ja, Mann, ja, ja, ja, ja
Deutschland im Dunkeln, dass sind Warsteiner- und Stoiber-Fans
und New-Balance-Botten, die abhotten zu Eurodance.
Das ist Partystimmung bei Grabschändern und Brandstiftern
und seit neustem hören die deutschrappende Tonguetwister.
Deutschland im Dunkeln ist die 6er-Packung Jever.
Die Tüten mit Videos voller Sex mit Lack und Leder,
Jede Menge Flachmänner, ein paar Waffen-Fachblätter,
denn der Spießer und seine Hand feiern Orgien im Verborgenen
Deutschland im Dunkeln, dass sind gebrochenene Nasen,
Vollkontakt, statt Kennenlernen, Motto des Abends
Hier 'ne Blonde Sippe, da 'ne Herde Primaten.
Aggro und unter Strom wie verzerrte Gitarren
Deutschland bei Nacht 'ne Plage wie Heuschrecken,
Einladend wie fremde Betten mit Keulflecken.
Ich seh' nur Nieselregen statt Liebesleben, 
statt Nächstenliebe Depressive, die sich mit Füßen treten.

(Refrain:)
Aber manche haben Scheinwerfer
und die haben 120 Kilowatt
Und sie fahren ihre eigenen Filme,
haben davon mehr als jedes Kino hat.

Deutschland im Dunkeln, dass sind glattgeleckte Innenstädte,
Menschenleer, nur Straßenfeger mit Pinzette,
Ansonsten registrieren die Bewegungsmelder 
nur die Typen vom Sicherheitsdienst auf dem Weg zu ihrem Bewährungshelfer.
Geschlossene Gesellschaft, bitte alle Tür'n versperren!
Sie wünschen sich den Führer her und gründen 'ne Bürgerwehr.
Geil auf Gesetze und im Fernseh'n laufen Strafverfahren.
Wo andre ein Herz haben, hat Deutschland 'ne Alarmanlage.
Deutschland im Dunkeln ist 'ne Arschkarte ziehen,
ist wie besoffen im Straßengraben zu liegen.
Tätowierte Polizisten die 'rumkommandieren 
und jedem der unter ihnen steht in den Mund onanieren.
Deutschland im Dunkeln die ganze Nacht zechen, Schnaps exen
in verstaubten, verrauchten und verbrauchten Gaststätten.
Gelittene, verbitterte saufende Dumm-Prolls.
Die Möbel wie die Gesinnung aus braunem Kunstholz,
oder im trauten Heim mit Möbeln aus Mahagoni.
Mama redet nie, Papa prügelt wie Trapattoni.
Sie ersticken in den vier Wänden in den sie leben
während wir die Dinge mit andern Augen sehen wie Chinesen.

(Refrain)

Ja, Deutschland im Dunkeln, in den Hügeln sind wieder Wandertage
und die Wiking-Kameraden marschier'n über Trampelfade
Formiert in Fackelzügen schwingen sie ihre Fahnen
Die Hemden glattgebügelt singen sie Lieder der Germanen
ums Feuer aufgereiht, ordentlich den Becher schwenken
hoch mit den rechten Händen und Rudolf Hess gedenken.
Doch gekommen sind sie aus einem ganz andern Grund:
Am Ende schieben sie sich kollektiv den Schwanz in den Mund.
Deutschland im Dunkeln was für ein wildes tolles Leben,
Konfettiregen, überall bilden sie Polonaisen. (Bei Nacht)
Am lautesten schrei'n die Pimmellosen, 
schwitzende Idioten, die stinken wie Pinkel-Proben.
'n Trauerzug statt Powermoves
Mit Leuten die Scheiße fressen, wie es 'n Staubsauger tut
ja viele müssen frier'n, trotz Treibhauseffekt.
Doch Licht an, Mann, jetzt wird ins deutsche Scheißhaus getagged!

(Refrain)

Das ist 'ne Kopfnuss in Cottbus,
oder n Anschlag in Darmstadt,
oder 'ne Schelle in Celle,
ein gebrochenes Schlüsselbein in Rüsselsheim,
und Flaschen mit Benzin 
in Maschen und Schwerin."
1,The Concretes,Warm Night,TRFMJIG128E0781679,2003,"follow you down on this warm night
down to a certain color
altough I'll make sure we fall on safe ground
I wouldnt lay your faith in my hands
snare me well with all your charms
bring out some amber to warm me
only kiss me if the light is right
otherwise we'll wait a while"
2,31Knots,Darling_ I,TRQFLPR128F92FBE55,2003,"More water
So the blood will not boil
setting course for
The crooked straights
Make me smile

The destination
is never where
I want to be

Thus what's spoken
Never has
Its own remorse

What I mean is I
offer no, no

Trust

Darling, I am letting go
Without a word to justify
'Cause studies show
More than half the time
We move our mouthes, we're full of shit

It's a renaissance of language
A renaissance of language
A renaissance of language
A renaissance

More water
So the blood will not boil
open road
Take us in and drive a while

A renaissance of language
A renaissance of language
A renaissance of language
A renaissance
We're full of shit
A renaissance"
3,goldenhorse,Northern Lights,TRSAQZQ128F1497489,2003,"Stones like these
Are just like fuel underground
You stop my feet
From floating up when I come down

I go up
And watch the world spinning round
But I came down

You can't see
That I'm like dust on the ground
The wind picks up
And then it blows me around

I go up
And watch the world spinning round
But I came down

Finding out the northern lights
Flicked up a single switch called rocket
Finding out the northern lights
Flicked up a single switch called rocket

Finding out the northern lights
The northern lights

Stones like these
Are just like fuel underground
You stop my feet
From floating up when I come down

I go up
And watch the world spinning round
But I came down

Finding out the northern lights
Flicked up a single switch called rocket
Finding out the northern lights
Flicked up a single switch called rocket

Finding out the northern lights

The northern lights

4,Steven Delopoulos,Runaway Train,TREJGPO128F14A2CF3,2003,"I was riding on a runaway train
She was flying like a seagull
Caught wind and shadow, and I called out for her name
The rock, the bird, the steeple

She was looking for a Saturday dance
I was hoping not to mumble
Just then she took me, and she kissed me in a stance
Guess we're headed for a tumble
Whoa...
We're gonna turn the page

She was looking for a circular event
We were aware of the spiral
And paranoia made us social as cement
We faded in colors and styles

A cup of tea for the Mrs. Little Man
Me, I'll have me a whiskey
You should have seen us when we very first met
The gun, the hat, the risky

Looking back I think she took me for a ride
I thought that I was jiving on the water
Walking side by side
But every drama dreamer never really drowns and dies
'Cause drama dreamers tumble, but we fade
And then we fly high

I was riding on a runaway train
She was flying like a seagull
Caught wind and shadow, and I called out for her name
The rock, the bird, the steeple
The rock, the bird, the steeple
The rock, the bird, the steeple
Whoa..."
5,Dido,White Flag,TRALLSG128F425A685,2003,"I know you think that I shouldn't still love you or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it, where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble, I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet, which I'm sure we will
All that was there will be there still
I'll let it pass and hold my tongue
And you will think that I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be"
6,Cilla Black,Anyone Who Had A Heart (Late Night Version),TRWVDYE128F42B3DBF,2003,"Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
Who couldn’t be another heart that hurt me?
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do?

Every time you go away I always say
This time it’s goodbye, dear
Loving you the way I do I take you back
Without you I’d die, dear
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
Who couldn’t be another heart that hurt me?
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do?

Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me too
Who couldn’t be another heart that hurt me?
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
Anyone who had a heart would simply take me
In his arms and always love me, why won’t you?
Yeah, anyone who had a heart would love me too
Anyone who had a heart would simply take me
In his arms and always love me, why won’t you?"
7,Eva Cassidy,God Bless The Child (Album Version),TRVWCLI128F42922ED,2003,"Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Hanging round your door
Then it's gone, and the money ends
They don't come around no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself baby
Oh don't you take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child who's got his own
Who's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Hanging round your door
Then it's gone, and the money ends
They don't come around no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself baby
Oh don't you take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have

8,Linea 77,Alienation Is The New Form Of Zen,TRJYNRT12903CDD64F,2003,"Surprise
cover your eyes
green light from my tv-screens
in my hidden place i find a world
this mellow sound fucked up my mind
fucked up my mind
under a different light
silence fills my brain
from mind to suburbia
i've lost myself in

Alienation is the new form of zen
Smart people waiting for their turn with the cash

white noise in my brain
i don't understand
switch off all my senses
NUMB 'till tomorrow

under a different light
silence fills my brain
from mind to suburbia
i've lost myself in

Alienation is the new form of zen
Smart people waiting for their turn with the cash"
9,Devics,You in the Glass,TRPVJFT128F4220580,2003,"deep in the woods
it was grey all around
only one rose
that never was meant to be found
""this is for my love who is no longer here""
inside these words were written in ink and tears
first story from you
now you awake when I begin to dream
I open my eyes and you turn off machines


you should be here with me
I know you are near


in through my hearts twisting and winding chords
there is a place where love soaks in all it's pores
under the sea deep in it's water core
you will find me weightless and waiting


in a car at night for a long way home
the saddest song on the radio
her in your arms on the seat next to me
reflection in glass wishing she was me
all happy with you


cause you should be here with me
I know you are near
you should be here I know you are near"
10,Frankie HI-NRG MC,Le Perdute Ali Dell'Olecrano,TRRXKYB128F42905A3,2003,"Ogni giorno dobbiamo dedicare un po' di tempo a noi stessi, isolandoci dal mondo per un breve riposo rigenerante.
Raccogliamoci in noi stessi.
(oooohhhmmmm)
Stringiamo le mani a pugno, irrigidiamo tutti i muscoli del corpo, allentiamo i muscoli del polpaccio, portiamo l'attenzione della mente alla mano sinistra, pieghiamo la parete muscolare che separa la cavità della coscia da quella della spalla sinistra.
Portiamo il piede sinistro oltre il ginocchio sinistro, all'inizio possiamo appoggiare un dito a una parete, oppure la schiena e la colonna vertebrale alla spalla destra. 
Espiriamo lentamente. Spingiamo la spalla destra al torace con rotazione del gluteo, restiamo così con tutti i muscoli allentati.
Ripetiamo alternando l'atto.
La posizione del cobra non è per colui che mengia troppo o che non mangia affatto, né per colui che dorme troppo o che si mantiene desto in eccesso.
Addome a terra, mani giunte avanti al petto, in modo di essere abbandonati in posizione ferma e comoda. 
Inspirando gonfiamo leggermente prima l'addome, poi gli occhi, le reni, la nuca. La lingua, lunga, leggera, punta in basso, con la pianta contro il lato interno della coscia, per stimolare le emozioni intestinali. 
Chiaramente resta a terra sangue, mascelle e denti si allentano, il fegato non lo sentiamo quasi più.
Con la mano destra afferriamo il cervello, un senso di calore si diffonde nelle membra e nel corpo. Dall'osso pubico allo sterno un stato di benessere invade ogni cellula dell'organismo.
Se abbiamo difficoltà eseguiamo come possibile.

(Grazie a Giò per questo testo)"

13,Autopilot Off,Raise Your Rifles,TRVZEGC128F92F6E8B,2003,"All my trials and tribulations
Have led me to one realization
That no matter where I've been
I'm still stuck inside my skin

And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in
Cause I won't end up twisted and insane

All those fears and reservations
Ended up as amputations
Cause no matter where I've been
I'm still stuck inside my skin

And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in
Cause I won't end up twisted and insane

And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in
Cause I won't end up twisted and insane

And all my insecurities
And my anxieties
Tore out my insides

And it took a while to find
That I don't really mind
Life on the outside

So take up your aim
And raise your rifles
Fire Away!
Cause I don't really care at all

And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in
Cause I won't end up twisted and insane

And I'm not trying to be something I'm not
Letting their thoughts get in
Cause I won't end up twisted and insane"
14,Karl Bartos,Life,TRHTZDR128F427F938,2003,"We've had a good time
Easy living like on a summerday
We got along fine
Even though we haven't had a lot to say
It's been alright
But much to my regret
I know that if I remain by your side
I might as well be dead

So glad we made it
Time will never change it
But finally 
I have to get on with my life

Life is a game
That one plays according to the rules
Forget my name
Maybe it will help you feeling cool
I have to move out
Got to carry on
Don't you know that only time will tell
If I'm right or wrong ?

So glad we made it
Time will never change it
But finally 
I have to get on with my life

I feel a rush in my blood
While I listen to the sound of music
Who you are and what you want to be
It doesn't matter much to me

So glad we made it
Time will never change it
But finally 
I have to get on with my life

Finally
I have to get on with my life
Finally
I have to get on with my life
Finally
I have to get on with my life
Finally
I have to get on with my life"

I never return to love somebody
Now all that I need is all I see in you
And only you
And if you get lost I'll always find you
You're all that I need your heart will keep you true
My only you

You make me fall and I can't sleep
You want it all but it's too deep
And I can't give it away
I just can't give it away

(Chorus 1)
When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
Just give it away
Just give it away
When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
Just give it away
Just give it away

(Verse 2)
Don't ever forget to tell somebody
The feelings inside to make your dreams come true
I dream of you
To feel so alive and want somebody
It's not make believe my world would be for you
And only you

(Bridge)
You make me fall and I can't sleep
You want it all but it's too deep
And I can't give it away
I just can't give it away

When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
Breathe in and give it away
Breathe out and give it away
When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
Breathe in and give it away
Breathe out and give it away

quello che metti ma come lo vesti
non è
quello che rappi ma come lo rappi

la rabbia che bruci ma come la sfoghi
non è
ciò che dici di sentire ma quello che provi
siamo dei prodi in battaglia cani di paglia
cani da caccia per te un cazzo di dramma
chi dubitava del vero ce l'ha davanti
la luce dei miei occhi è come quella dei diamanti
vivo solo per questo e non puoi togliermelo
sul disco doppio c'è un senso e devi cogliermelo
non puoi permettere a qualcuno di rubarti una chance
in questa vita si pedala come al tour de france
perchè con gli anni qualcosa l'ho imparato
tutto ciò che dico è meditato non spreco il fiato
e nel gioco ho visto cose 
che sembrano rap ma sono finte come il black nel black jack
un bel check un bel live un bel set
nessuno li regala se prima non vede il cash
le cose più belle devi lottare per averle
e se le ottieni devi lottare ancora per tenerle

La gente ruba ti fruga nelle tasche
lo so B, non sempre ho tempo di occuparmene
ho cercato di investire il tempo senza alcun presentimento
l'interrutore sempre spento costa troppo riscaldare questo posto
da quando son finiti i soldi non ti riconosco
non eri quello che faceva rap produceva beats
ci mangeremo anche i tuoi soldi che hai lasciato qui
ero costernato ho capito poi che l'essere infottato è un fattore innato
se ce l'hai ti rimane non ci sono cazzi
se non ce l'hai ti scompare mano a mano che cresci con gli anni
è la forza dell'hip hop che spacca questa società di merda
che vive come nelle soap
è la forza della strada che non vivo ma respiro e spingo sempre per il beat che ha più tiro
e non mi vedi in giro con la giacca e la cravatta 
ho deciso di tenermi vivo e lasciare una traccia
e se è vero che lo scrivo e l'ho deciso per primo lo faccio per ciso

e guarda che ti sbagli che chiami Old School Bassi solo perchè ho il doppio dei tuoi anni
non ho ancora dato a sufficienza sono un tipo che ha pazienza
e ho fatto un altro pieno di benza e non ti ho mai lasciato senza
tanto che hai dovuto scegliere tra prepotenza e coerenza
e sano biz ti fa ancora strano perchè sul beat siamo fratelli come ???
e dimostriamo ciò che siamo
la musica che amiamo
i dischi che ascoltiamo e che suoniamo
sono un maestro nella mia stessa classe
perchè la mia merda ti fa ancora esplodere le casse"

Trying to catch up on last night
Not just me' her again'
I turn my head to see

'Thank you, it was fun!' she wrote
Again, these words stuck in my throat
It's coming back, we're at the club
We'd taken a few and ended up

Wined and dined, then up she jumped
She drove me mad, she gave me head
She blew my mind, I got behind
'Watch out for this killer-babe!'

Hello she says, Hello and goodbye
The morning after she'll be gone
She and I, Hello and goodbye
The morning after she'll be gone

On and on
Too hard, too hot
She damn well knew to hit that spot
There's no way out, 'Man! I'm screwed'
She new exactly when and what she'd do
How do you do?

Hello she says, Hello and goodbye
The morning after she'll be gone
She and I, Hello and goodbye
The morning after she'll be gone

Don't make the face you do every time

So I smiled

You really deserve someone better than me
Who'll love you and be what you want them to be

You won't feel so empty it won't feel so bad
It's so hard to leave while you're looking that said

Didn't know where he was but a
purpose he had to follow
There was laughter all around him
People mocking his visions and
prophecies deemed as hollow

Then the sky crashed down
And the spheres collide
They would hide in fear
Feel the darkness near

Hey now, fallen star
Your soul was not meant to be free
Fire, across the sky
This time he knows it's for real
Hey now, fallen star
Breaking up seven seals
Fire, across the sky
This time he knows it's for real

Riding on through endless skies
On a steed pearly white as the
sun-sparkling mist of morning
With a mind set on just one mission
Save the earth from the void, be a
guardian of all that's righteous

Then the sky crashed down
And the spheres collide
People hide in fear
Now the darkness is near

Struggling with the beast for an age
A final blow falls hard through his heart
Silently they fall to the ground
United, both as one, one as all"

26,Rolf Harris,A Pub With No Beer,TRDWNHG128F423D09A,2003,"It's lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer.

Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
And there's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
Oh what a terrible place is a pub with no beer.

Then the stockman rides up with his dry dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar and pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
As the barman says sadly ""The pub's got no beer.""

Then the swaggy comes in smothered in dust and flies
He throws down his roll and rubs the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told he says ""What's this I hear?
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer"".

There's a dog on the verandah for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer.

Old Billy the blacksmith the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen she says ""You're early my dear""
But then he breaks down and he tells her ""The pub's got no beer"".

It's lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothing so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer."

Run through Little Havana yelling ""Viva Fidel!""
Jerking off with the sheets, when I stay at hotels
Drinking Bacardi at AA meetings, smoking an L
I'm broke as hell, my attitude is no good
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture nigga, I'm the best of both worlds
Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Let's face it you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl? Bitch get over here, give me some brain!
I'll bust off on her face, and right after this segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro-lifers, that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war, when niggas know that your puss
A fucking hypocrite draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me nigga, cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Send a death fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way

Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said hip hop was dead, but I invoking the spirit
We're taking it, back in the day to the Golden Age
When whack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the Internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A raging alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgusting flows like third world country tap-water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
Cause I'm a prank call, Cop-Shot, just for kicks
Pay back, for everytime that they called me a spic
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco (crazy)
And Dominican women call me the rompe toto (pussy destroyer) 
They call me osioso (obnoxious), I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize, the way that I spit
You coffee shop revolutionary son-of-a-bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggas speculate, what the fuck Pac would say
You don't know shit, about a dead man's perspective
And talking shit will get your neckbone disconnected
Disrespected, niggaz don't ""show no love""
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo thug
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you, to prove that you be falling off
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire

Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics, I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it

We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

Daaaaamn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she think you a phony
I'll take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam

Fuck you and I'm gone, fuck ya'll niggas!

If you want to be a lady

Paint your lips a touch too wide
Hide secrets in your mouth
Stand on corners for too long
Just to have a look-see
Hang your purse on your left
Your lover’s photo turn it right
If you want to meet a lady
Well then, offer her a ride

All these men are looking
Looking at me
Giving me the once over
With a big old look-see

Carry the world by its knees
Keep the porch-light burning bright
You sell yourself for nothing less than
One grandstanding night
If take it from me

Or doing all the walking
I'm stuck here in the middle
At war with good and evil

I can hear you talking 
I'm doing all the walking now
And change ?your?(all)? advice, we'll
Believing you can fly


Rhythm of mind
Don't want to spend my time
Being afraid of dying
I really want to be good

Drowned in a world of pity and sorrow
Then a burst within the light
What was I looking to find?
Run along to the sea

I want love 
If love wants me

I want God 
If God wants me

Just can't hold on to what I believe"

Ich schliesse die Augen und weiss wo Du bist

Ich kann es fühlen, muss es nicht sehen
Ich will es nur sein, will's nicht erklären

Denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht
weil Du mich überall erreichst
weil Du mich siehst und mir vergibst
und so unbeschreiblich liebst
denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht

Ich werd nichts versäumen,lauf nichts hinterher
hab alles gefunden, suche nicht mehr
Ich lasse mich fallen, berühre den Grund

Ich denke nicht nach und lass Dich gewähren
Ich bleibe unversehrt, vermiss nichts mehr

Denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht
weil Du mich überall erreichst
weil Du mich siehst und mir vergibst
und so unbeschreiblich liebst
denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht
weil Du mich jeden Tag befreist
weil Du, gewacht während ich schlief
und Du unbeschreiblich bist
denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht
mich so leicht, so leicht
weil du mich überall erreichst und Du mich jeden Tag befreist

denn alles an Dir macht mich so leicht

Wenn Hoffnung zerbricht
Wenn die Zeiten sich drehn

You've made your bed
Now sleep in it
Talked a lot of shit
But you never lived up to it
You like the game
Then take the pain
Arsenal of anger and a hate for authority

I'm watching the world collapse around me
I don't even care no more
I'm watching you all collapse

Collapse
Well here we go again
A different kind of killer with a brand new initiative
A social rape
You like to take
You stole control
Benefited on apathy
You fear the light
But want the life
Not allowed to touch it
But it's dangling in your sight
Look past yourself
Too blind to see
Every single person owns a different reality

There's a chill in the air and a howl of a wolf
While the rain beats at the door

Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry

When the dawn of a new day will see the light
Then the strongest hearts grow old
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell
No-one heard what once was said
And the eagle fly through the clouds while
The earth bleeds dark and cold
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold

When the color of night will fade to light and
The weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day
Never giving in until we find the words, till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say...

Burning starfire, shine in the sky
For the lives of great men, who stand by your side
When the night falls, on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

Acoustic Solo: Sam

Dark night on the valley below still
The horsemen follow through
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill
That inside the magic holds
Seven strong they ride on along to the place
Where sorrow lies
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide
All their mysteries come undone

When the color of night will fade to light
And the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day
Never giving in until we find the words...
Till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say...

Burning starfire, shine in the sky
For the lives of great men, who stand by your side
When the night falls, on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

MAAILMALLE

Kuun vielä varttuessa
kulki kuiskaus päällä veen kaukaa.
Aallot levotonna löivät
vasten sateen pieksemää rantaa.

Kauan hiljaisia lienneet
salot alla pohjoisen taivaan.
Vain yksinäinen vire tuulen soi.

Keihäs karhunkaatajan
maassa saaliin vierellä vartoi
vaiti suurta laivaa saapuvaa.

Ei kukaan tiennyt nähdä sarastukseen
ja päivä laski taas.

Kuulkaa huuto korppien
halki taivaiden,
näin saapuu tuho jumalten
maailmaamme.

On tullut se aika jolloin auringon pyörä
veren vuodatuksesta katkeaa.

Liput kauniit liehuen
airut rantakiville astuu.
He miekoin meitä tervehtivät,
vapaudesta puhua saavat.

Loimet vieraat yllänsä
puiseen ristiin veriveli tarttuu.
Hän suden mahdin mielii taltuttaa.

Keihäs karhunkaatajan
vastaan käärmekieltä nyt nousee
ja iskee läpi kurjan sydämen.

Vaan eivät sankarit enää nouse raunioille
ja laulumme tuuli vie.

Kuulkaa suru metsien
halki aikojen,
on pyhät kivet kaadettu
ja kansa voipunut.

Valtaa kuoleman sylistä
uhmaa teräs välkkyen.
Tuoni käsissä jumalten,
maine miehen ikuinen.

Jo syttyvät nuo soihdut, ne ruumiit kärventävät
ja syyttömien sielut tuomitaan.
Kuinka riistävät he jumalat nyt viereltämme,
vaikenevat tuhannet edessä murhaajan.

Kirveenkuva rinnalla
karhun lailla taistellen,
Ukon voima sydämessä
vielä kaatuu viimeinen.

I spent most of it trying to breathe in
Always ill at ease, too willing to please

And too phoney to celebrate wins

65,Tom McRae,A Day Like Today,TRTAXBJ128F4288909,2003,"""Welcome back,""
Says the voice on the radio.
But I never left;
I was always right here.

In your hand all the colours
You thought were kings
At the turn of a card
Can just disappear.

I wish I could comfort you,
If love is our defense,
It's alright, I can comfort you,
If you let me, I could love you to death.

Need to see, need to say,
Need to be something beautiful.
I can't get today
Out of my mind.

Need to say, need to call,
Need to love someone beautiful.
A day like today
Has stained my eyes.

All I ever say,
And all I ever do,
Is just a message to you,
And all i ever play,
Are the cards you gave me,
It's just my version of the truth.

All I ever say,

Just hope there's altitude and prayer
And if we survive the takeoff
The chances of accident are small
As long as there's some procedure
For fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

So now we're drawing straws to see
Just who will get the duty free
When you're on auto-pilot
And running on fumes and alcohol
The moment of truth deciding
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

And I'll go down in flames just for the hell of it all
Because I couldn't take
Standing in place
Waiting to fall
Fighting the stall
Fighting the stall

So we'll attempt the landing
And spiral into a fireball
'Cause that was the understanding
Fighting the stall

After 4 bottles of Don
The kid start feelin' woozie

You write what you've seen in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me

Now ash yourself, yeah, out on the insides, said I loved you but I lied

I wouldn't piss to put you out
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you

So bury me in memory

So wrap it tight around your throat

On the drive home
Joke about the kid you used to see
And his jealousy
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool
As when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth (his teeth)

The boy's eyes were red
But he could see that skyline

Stella's going up to New York City and
I'm getting the pieces stuck in my heart
She said that she don't need me this time
This time I'm fallin'
Stella's leaving me for someday
She's got it all worked out
It ain't cool where the sun don't shine at all

There's no rest for the wicked child
And Stella hadn't slept in days
Her mind was haze of New York City, sunshine, JD, and cocaine
She was just a crazy child born
Another sign of a revolution
Sifting through the sin for who knows who

She was like ""Let's go downtown tonight
I need voodoo so I don't mind dying,
Please don't let me fall asleep alone.""

Still they don't like the way I play

Betapa aku telah lama tinggalkan binar di hatiku
Aku mungkin kan tertawa
Namun jiwaku terasa jauh

Tak lelah kupandang langit
Berjuta harap ku menanti
Penuh harap kumenanti
Keajaiban datang dan menghampiriku

Aku masih menunggu
Dan menunggu

Berharap akan datang
Keajaiban.

Tak lebih dari sebuah perjalanan

Semoga tak lelah aku terus berpeluh

I never put a mudpack onmy face.
Oh, who'd have thought
That I'd walk in the daze now?
I never go to shows at night,
But just to matinees now.
I see the show
And home I go.

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire,
Uneasy in my easy chair.
It never entered my mind.

Once you told me I was mistaken,
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one.
It never entered my mind.

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself.

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you where there again
To get into my hair again.
It never entered my mind."

Hombres que pierden la tierra sin saber la razon
Madres que lloran la ausencia de hijos perdidos

Piratas que pudren los mares de aguas critalinas
Leones que comen las carnes estando en el nido
Hombres que ensayan cohetes en tierras sufridas
Lacras, ambiciosas, de mal proceder
Hoy en la tierra molesta el que piensa en la paz
Hombres que pierden la vida por manos oscuras

Madres que lloran hijos cuando viene la muerte

Je ne peux pas m'imaginer que tout est à jamais figé

Better you save your files in time
No matter what they say

Some get hunted, some live a single day
Some are just like birds of prey

The more life's in vain
I'm caught in this place
I'm lost in the space of an endless maze
The small human race
The god that we choose - unfortunately gone

Pintando las paredes con tantos recuerdos
Rayandome la vida con tanto silencio
Por que hace mucho tiempo que ya no te tengo
Es que un maldito imbecil me robo mi sueos
Tengo herido el corazon y me sangra la razon
Ay ya no puedo estar sin ti.
Por tu amor renuncie a mi vida por vivir tu vida
Rebate mis sueos por vivir tus sueos

I disgrace clowns who make frowns
Smile in your face but hate and deliver fake pounds
I'm a animal, in a cannibal sector
With chicks that give you brains like Hannibal Lector
Peep logic - there's nothin you can do to stop this
You have a better chance catchin bullets with chopsticks (WAHH!)
Wait for the avalance - then you'll get down
Spit rounds, my sitcom's a full clip now
Murder shows, practiced and unrehearsed, dead on point
Like a convertible cactus hearse
It's mucus fluid, when I spit exclusive music
I believe in dirt, SO I DO IT STUPID
I move units, like {?} and white rose

Roll red carpets in darkness through Death Valley

To drink booze in the House of Blues
Doin the JAMES, in Elvis Presley shoes
From the belly of BK, where the drama's at
All the way to Saudi Arabia - where the llamas at
Trapped in central bookings - for a chronic sack
Feelin worse; I'm really here, for killin a verse
Homicide comes to ask &amp;quot;Who did it?&amp;quot;
I step to the next +Iron Galaxy+ like astral physics
I'm spiked with no sugar, natural image
Thirst is nothin, burst you for frontin at the scrimmage
Vampires suck, you stuck once bitten
Off the head I'm fed, my freestyle eats my written
I need that dollar like Chris Rock - just kiddin
I'm down to earth like sunlight, and alien visits
In the club with {?}, guzzlin water
Trainin my daughter to be a soldier, I taught her
to put six in your chest - like Julius Earving

So many mistakes made, in so little time
Girl I'm so regretful
I must've been outta my mind

Chorus

I don't wanna live another day
Without you by my side
I don't wanna run any more
Runnin' outta places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen 
That I Should've got down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me

Verse 2

And what I'm feeling for you
Never could I try to hide 
The fact that I had told you
Always seems to come outside
You are my heart beat
The reason I breathe (ohhh)
Please baby forgive me
While im down on my knees

Chorus (x3)

I don't wanna live another day
Without you by my side
I don't wanna run any more
Runnin' outta places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen 
That I Should've got down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me

I don't wanna Sleep
I don't wanna fall
I can see the night
From my heart 'n' soul"

It's hard to dig it all too happily
But I can see
It's not always that real to me
A funny thing
Is always a funny thing
Though sadly things
Just get in the way

Open to suggestion
Falling over questions

Hopefully
But that's as well as maybe
A shaking hand
Won't transmit all fidelity
Your golden smile
Would shame a politician
Typically
I'll apologise next time

Bonds will break and fade
Go snapping all in two
The lies that bind the tie
Come sailing out of you

Realistically, 
Hard to dig it all too happily
But I can see, 
Not always that real to me
A funny thing
Is always a funny thing
And those sadly things
Is always a sadly thing

Bonds will break and fade
A snapping all in two
The lies that bind the tie
Come sailing out of you

A show of strength
Is all you want
You can never set it down...

Guts and passion
Those things you can't
Even set down
All those things you think might count
You can't ever set them down
Don't ever set them down
Never set them down
Hey, I came in right on cue
One is me and one is you...
Hey, I came in right on cue
One is me and one is you..."
90,Broadcast,The Little Bell,TRIQJYX128F92FFD53,2003,"The little bell lies on the ground 
Although it tries it cannot sound 
It used to ring across the air 
Its sweetened tone would linger there 

But from a careless hand it rocked 
Its shell is only made of crock 
Although it lies there split in two 
It still tries to ring out to you 

Now deep inside my wooden clock 
There is a tick but not a tock 
Although into the room it chimes 
It only tells me half the time 

Why do you leave me so confused 
I'll miss my bus, my job I'll lose 
Oh what is wrong my wooden clock 
It breaks my heart to see you stop"

When we hungry we be thieving
Be on some mask and black glove shit in the evening
My hustlers struggling on the block y'all know the reason
Son when the price of coke go up it's robbing season

When we hungry we be thieving
Be on some mask and black glove shit in the evening
My hustlers struggling on the block y'all know the reason
Son when the price of coke go up it's robbing season
Ya feeling me?

(Verse One)
Ain't no more money on the block, got 2 felonies and grams to measure
Been tryna move this coke for a while and get the treasure
In this hustling shit, we barely survive week to week
Ain't tryna starve in the street, nigga we robbing to eat
What the fuck you think all the guns are for
Whenever there's a coke drought
Everybody's kissing the fucking floor
When shit get hot at night niggaz will pick a lock
Run in and vick a spot, you flip we lick a shot
Gimme the yayo and the loot poppi (a nigga hungry)
Or catch a halo when we shoot poppi (don't try to starve me)
Only been home a minute and my lieutenant turned informant
D's be kicking my door in 6 in the morning with a warrant
My team be out of state rushing gates dressed like jake
Geisting cakes, leaving niggaz handcuffed to the fire escapes
Thieves in the nite, we on the run nigga we homeless
Quick to run up in ya crib with a wig and catch a bonus

(Chorus One)

Put the money in the bag nigga
Give up the goods and surrender!

(Chorus Two)
Thieves in the nite, sneaky like the rook
Face wrapped like a sheik, when it's time to do a jook
Got you looking down the barrel of the gun of a crook, from Red Hook
It's a jewel heist don't get ya life took
Put the gat to ya head, blow ya brains out the other side
Slide up in the getaway ride, then we hide
Hit the headquarters, then the goods we divide
Make you deep throat the magnum, here nigga open wide!

(Chorus One)

(Verse Two)
late at night we creep around in cabs looking for suspect
In my mind investing money I ain't touch yet
Pulling out fake badges on workers, we lust that
Strip 'em of their work and gat, so they don't bust back
When our ribs are touching, shit we find another crib to rush in
For that money, niggaz'll give ya fucking kids concussions
Niggaz get launched like rockets
Their shit slapped out the sockets
Don't empty that safe and them fucking pockets
Try to play hero, don't come up off tha dinero
Get a holey sombrero, shit ain't fair but I don't care yo
Us martyrs be on late night train robberies
Don't be that lucky winner in ""BLOW OUT YA BRAIN LOTTERY""
And lose a major vein or artery
We tryna survive and feed a family
And balance the economy
Tuck in ya jewelry and ya valuables
When you see that hungry look on my face
Or you'll see what the double barrel do

(Chorus One)

Put the money in the bag nigga
Give up the goods and surrender!

(Chorus Two)

(Chorus One)

Give up the goods and surrender
Cause when I slap yo ass, you ain't gonna remember!"

strung along the finer rip and tears of your heart. 
And it is there to keep you together where we're all falling apart 

My conscience drifts and sleeps in shifts 
Trading off between my open hand and swinging fists 
And this alcohol, my wrecking ball, 
Keeps me talking to the angels buried in these walls 

But, Contrary to counter culture 
I don't care if the killing stops 
Or if suffocation claims my lungs 

we, walk a nightmare line 
wide awake and dead at the same time 
we, walk a nightmare line 
wide awake and dead the same time 

This ringing room has been raped and ruined 
Completely torn apart by the few who think that they'll find you 
But time and fate, those things i hate 
Both have their ways of playing off the winters weight 
were both older and seven snowfalls 
worth of colder earth has left us reaching 

we, walk a nightmare line 
wide awake and dead at the same time 
we, walk a nightmare line 
wide awake and dead the same time 

(At the same time) 

The cellar door is coming up, coming up 
and we've had time to lock it up, lock it up 
I'm feverish i'm burning up burning 
And i pray to god there's time enough, time enough 
you know that i love you, But now i just can't shut you up, shut you up, so now i'll have to chop you up, chop you up 
And I'll just wait till I get caught"

Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown.

And it's rainin' all over the world
It's raining all over the world
Tonight, the longest night.

She came to me like my friend 
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown.

Save me, oh, save me
It's unreal the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown.

And it's rainin' all over the world

Raining all over the world

The longest night.

And it's rainin' all over the world

Tonight, the longest night.

When I'm ready for save
Oh, I'm fool for you
You know that real that
Go on and save me.

Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?

There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man (For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all)
I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now
It's your boy Kanye to the, Chi-town, what's goin' on? (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah

Kanye West:
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)

Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

Kanye West:
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)

Career is why I think or say the things I do
Relationship in honesty, so here's a little story for you;
Met a girl, I met a girl at random,
Random is as random does
Justify don't ask me why...why?
Just because.

I'm acting like a day old male
Day old female

Saturday, another day, and life's a little give and take
Take and give
I'm staying home, I'm sorry boys I'm a little sensitive
But still you're saying;
'Faggot is as faggot does with every little faggot thing a faggot do'
I'm not insane, I'm not insane...I'm just smarter than you.
You're acting like a day old male
Day old female
Analyze, Compromise.
WHY???

But I'm loving
...And insecure
...And just a little bit violent
But I know for sure,
I'm here for your entertainment
I'm here, for your unbridled entertainment
So lets go.

Far away, in Fantasy
Don't get me wrong I like it too and feel it too
But understand that man or woman, I don't want to sleep with you.
'Cause power is as power does
With every little power trip we pull because;
It's all inside our selfish pride wanting the control of it all
(controlling it all! CONTROL EMOTION!!!)

Analyze.
Compromise. (compromise baby...)

I believe in life there's 
More than wrong or right
I believe in colors there's 
No black or white

And you don't know 
What you have got until you say goodbye
But in my dreams one day 
I spread my wings and I will fly

I believe in visions
I believe in love
I believe in magic
But this is not enough

I believe in freedom (Oh I believe, Oh!)
I believe in dreams (I believe, Oh!)
I believe in heroes
But this is not enough...

(I believe)

I believe my dream can be reality
I believe my time on earth is destiny (Oh I believe)

I wonder if they change their minds
It's an understated sign
Tell me how you see me again 
Now we're swinging to the time
It's a meeting of the minds
It's all unbelievable
Look to play it how we say it
If you're meaning to delay it
Hang on
Cos we're moving all around

Chorus
It's up when the party's over
And we want to free our minds
Now I'm telling you there's no hurry
Cos we're choosing to groove
It's so cool to dance the night way

I choose to live a good life
Have a good time and enjoy the ride
Turn it up, break it down, move on
High times took a good turn
Spinning it around cos you gotta learn
To rectify, justify this song

Now we're swinging to the time
It's a meeting of the minds
It's all unbelievable
Look to play it how we say it
If you're meaning to delay it

122,Julie Doiron,The Songwriter,TRSEMJG128F1497E3A,2003,"I have a jealous heart
It holds your name
It holds your spark
'Till you come home
It stays in touch
Without a right

Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons

I have this coat I wear
It keeps me warm
I wear it well
'Till you come home
I had it cleaned
To remove the smell
To remove you
But it ain't right

Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons
Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons

They call me a songwriter
But you, you're a songwriter
Storyteller, where are you?
They call me the songwriter

Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons
Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons

I have a jealous heart
It holds your name
It holds your spark
'Till you come back
It stays in touch
Without a right

Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away the reasons
Take away all the reasons why I care
Take away all my reasons"
123,Hall & Oates,Breath Of Your Life,TRCEUHN12903CB7759,2003,"I can read between the lonely lines
Every single word brings a tear to my eye
Tell me how did we get here
And where did heaven go

I remember us as strong as stone
Now I see the cracks breaking up a home
And a future filled with fear
But I won't surrender no
We can make it through the fire
I won't lay it down and die
I will be the air, if you are out of breath
And out of time

Baby don't it feel right
Don't you know why
Won't you say what it is
Why you just can't see what's going on
I'll be the Breath of Your Life

See the way the wind blows
No matter how it goes
I'm the air that you need
If you're out of breath and out of time
I'll be the Breath of Your Life
Baby, no no we ain't out of time

I don't want to go around again
Passionate lover turning into friend
I don't want to be back there
Let that heaven go
Explain the things you really need
I can make it happen if you talk to me

Though I cannot read your mind
I can get into your soul
We Could Make it through the Fire
I won't lie down and die
I will be the air if you are out of breath and out of time

Baby don't it feel right
Don't you know why
Won't you say what it is
Why you just can't see what's going on
I'll be the Breath of Your Life

See the way the wind blows
No matter how it goes
I'm the air that you need
If you're out of breath and out of time
I'll be the Breath of Your Life
Baby, no no we ain't out of time

Are you feeling like you're drowning
Are you choking?
And you just don't know what to do
Well I can help you make it through
And I the one to save it?

I really think that we could do this
get through this
Don't doubt it, think about it
Be sure you can depend on me
Let me be the air that you breathe

Baby don't it feel right
Don't you know why
Won't you say what it is
Why you just can't see what's going on
I'll be the Breath of Your Life"

125,Roger Creager,Shreveport To New Orleans,TRNOKJL128F421D5F8,2003,"I met a little gal around Thibodaux, she said she was 18. 
A hometown hottie she was good to go
My little Cajun queen. 

She's as hot as good country cooking. 
She'll drive you wild she's so good looking. 
I ain't seen nothing like that girl 
From Shreveport to New Orleans. 

Her daddy found out about our loving 
He was mad as hell and mean. 
We stole his truck to get away and a tank of gasoline. 
He called the law, we started running
Sirens blaring, heart was pumping, it was a high speed chase and a 
get away from Shreveport to New Orleans.

Chorus: 
She's all I ever wanted. 
She's all I'll ever need. 
I ain't seen nothing like that gal 
From Shreveport to New Orleans. 

I woke up in that motor-court she was nowhere to be seen. She done high-tailed it out of there 
And picked my wallet clean. 
She told the law where I'd been hiding. 
A man came knocking and I went sliding out the window And down the road from Shreveport to New Orleans. 

Chorus

Out of gas and out of luck and out of hopes and dreams, 
Busted by the state police mile marker 118. 
Judge said, ""Son, they'll be no bail."" 
Come midnight I broke out of jail 
And I've been trying to find that gal 
From Shreveport to New Orleans. 

Chorus."
126,Pride And Fall,Extinction Means Forever,TRDHNQQ12903CC548C,2003,"I did not think we'd get this far
Never thought we'd stand apart
The signs you gave to me
Remembered all of them by heart

So now I stand and face the pain
As if it matters once again
I have no time to cry
As if it matters cause it rains

Emasculation is your game
In a sense almost your trade
What made you think of this?
Reign this time while you decide

This means goodbye you've come to this
Thought this time I would not miss
For what you gave to me
Extincted thoughts is what exist"
127,Starflyer 59,Passengers (Old Album Version),TRKOMGG128F427B743,2003,"gifts that give and try to get into my life
with guilts i give into the damage to my lungs
and never look back
i want to be like the passengers
that wave goodbye
just wave goodbye

gifts that give and try to get into your life
with guilts i give into more damage to my lungs
and never look back
i want to be like the passengers
that wave goodbye
just wave goodbye

and never look back
i want to be like the passengers
that wave goodbye
just wave goodbye"
128,Darwin Hobbs,You Are God (Broken Album Version),TRACWYD128F1465B4A,2003,"[Verse 1:]
You are God and King,

129,The Handsome Family,Sleepy,TRHHLSH128F932C91F,2003,"I woke up from a sound sleep
They were all around me
Their black eyes shone, small polished stones
I found I couldn't move, they took me through the roofs

But I was sleepy
And it was easy
To fall back to sleep

But I was sleepy
And it was easy
To fall back to sleep

Blood and glass on my bare feet
I went wild through pine trees
A black car slowed, noises on the phone
The stars came falling down, all the lights went out

But I was sleepy
And it was easy
To fall back to sleep"
130,Labyrinth,The Prophet,TREOMTB12903CF1E33,2003,"It was a nite dark 'n' cold
Same old situation on the streets
No one was thinkin' 'bout what should become
When a strange man started to say
Sinners you are you've got no shame for
The evil you've done Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our souls
Cries in downtown The Ground is shakin'
End is near blindin' fear Cries in downtown
No way to run Thy will is done
Eyes full of dread 'roundthat man
The prophet continued his warning
But in between blades of fire From the clouds
Burn everything that he said
Sinners you are now you will pay for The evil you've done
Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our soul"
