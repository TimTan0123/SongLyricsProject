0,Bessie Smith,The Gin House Blues,TRVIZZD128F424D240,1926,"I've got a sad sad story today
I've got a sad sad story today
I'm goin' to the gin house when the whistle blows
My troubles come like rain 
That's all been poured before

My man keeps me cryin' all night
My man keeps me cryin' all night
I'm goin' to the gin house, sit there by myself
I mean to drown my sorrows 
By sweet somebody else

I've got those worst kind of gin house blues
I've got those worst kind of gin house blues
I'll make one trip there to seek to ease my mind
And if I do I'm gonna make it 
My last time

It takes a good smart woman these days
It takes a good smart woman these days
To hold her man when these gals have got so many tearful ways
I mean to watch my man
Don't care what these other gals say

I've got to see the conjure man too
I've got to see the conjure man too
Because these gin house blues is campin' 'round my door
I want him to drive them off
So they won't come back no more"
1,Blind Blake,Early Morning Blues,TRKQXPL128F424ADCC,1926,"Early this morning, my baby made me sore
I'm going away to leave you, ain't coming back no more

Tell me pretty mama, where did you stay last night
It ain't none of your business, daddy since I treat you right

When you see me sleeping, baby don't you think I'm drunk
I got one eye on my pistol, and the other on your trunk

I love you pretty mama, believe me it ain't no lie
The day you dare to quit me, baby that's the day you die"
2,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Dry Southern Blues,TRWYSVK128F933EC0D,1926,"My mind leads me to take a trip down south
Well, my mind leads me to take a trip down south
Take a trip down south and stop at the fatmouth's house

One train left the depot with the red and blue light behind
Train left the depot with the red and blue light behind
Well, the blue light's the blues, the red light's a worried mind

I hate to tell you, sugar, it 'tain't nobody there
Well, I hate to tell you, it 'tain't nobody there
If a man stay here, he'll stay most anywhere

I got up this mornin', ramblin' for my shoes
I got up this mornin', ramblin' for my shoes
The little woman served me a saucer full of worried blues

Uncle Sam was no woman, but didn't he draft your man
Uncle Sam was no woman, but didn't he draft your man
Tell me them good lookin' womens on the border raisin' sand

Well, women on the border's drinkin' over the water trough
I say, women on the border's drinkin' over the water trough
I wished Uncle Sam would hurry up and pay these soldiers off

I can't drink coffee and the woman won't make no tea
Man, I can't drink coffee and the woman won't make no tea
I believe to my soul sweet mama gonna hoodoo me

Asked the girl did she love me, said, ""Lemon, I don't nohow""
Asked that girl did she love me, said, ""Lemon, I don't nohow""
Cause of me commentatin', ""Yes, I love you sky high""

She had feet like a monkey, head like a teddy bear
Feet like a monkey, head like a teddy bear
And a mouth full of Levi Garrett, skeetin' it everywhere

I got a girl in Cuba, I've got a girl in Spain
I got a girl in Cuba, I've got a girl in Spain
I've got a brown yonder in Dallas, I'm afraid to call her name"
3,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Long Lonesome Blues,TRRDLHN128F930B00A,1926,"Version (2472-2) March 1926

I walked from Dallas, I walked to Wichita Falls
I say, I walked from Dallas, I walked to Wichita Falls
Hadn't have lost my sugar, well, I would not have walked at all

Some women see you comin', man, they go get the rocker chair
Women see you comin', go get the rocker chair
""I wanna fool this man and make out he's welcome here""

So cold in China, the birds can hardly sing
So cold in China, birds can hardly sing
You didn't make me mad till you soak my diamond ring

Hey, mama and papa, and papa's papa 'deed double do love you, doggone it
Somebody's talkin' to you, mama and papa 'deed double do love you
What you cryin' 'bout, sugar, papa don't care what you do

Well, I know my baby, she's gonna jump and shout
Said, I know my baby's gonna jump and shout
When she gets a letter Lemon have rolled them few days out

Would you tell me what's the matter, baby, I can't get no mail
Baby, tell me what's the matter, Papa Lemon can't get no mail
Mama, dreamt last night, pulled a black cat across your trail

Excuse me, baby, from knockin' on your door
Well, excuse me, baby, from knockin' on your door
If my mind don't change, I'll never knock here no more

I got up this mornin' with the blues all around my bed
I got up this mornin', blues all around my bed
Fixin' to eat my breakfast, the blues all in my bread"
4,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Got The Blues,TRBFMCN128F423625D,1926,"Well the blues come to Texas, lopin' like a mule
I say, the blues come to Texas lopin' like a mule
You take a high brown woman, man, she's hard to fool

You can't ever tell what a woman's got on her mind
Man, you can't tell what a woman's got on her mind
You might think she's crazy about you, she's leavin' you all the time

She ain't so good lookin', teeth don't shine like pearls
She ain't so good lookin' and her teeth don't shine like pearls
But that nice disposition carries that woman all through the world

I'm goin' to the river, carry my rocker chair
Goin' to the river, gonna carry my rocker chair
Gonna ask that gal from Crowell, how's the worried blues rest here?
Gonna ask that gal from Crowell, how's the worried blues rest here?

Lord, I think I heard my good gal callin' me
Hey, hey, my good gal callin' me
She doesn't call so loud but you hear her say Lemon so plain

I was raised in Texas, schooled in Tennessee
I was raised in Texas, was schooled in Tennessee
Said, woman, you can't make no fatmouth outa me

Sayin' a woman acts funny, quittin' you for another bald man
I say that a woman acts funny, quittin' you for another man
She don't wanna look at you straight but she's always raisin' sand"
5,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Beggin' Back,TRJEWFJ128F429F3B8,1926,"Oh, my baby, take me back
Why won't take me back?

Listen here, mama, I'll be good
Make your fire and cut your wood

When I had you, you wouldn't do
I got another and I don't want you

Oh, go on old joker, every time it gets cold
You commence to beggin' me to take you back
You know I don't care anything for you
Why do you worry me so?
You treats me like, like you uhh fixin' to leave me now
Baby, now I wants to tell you, you ain't been actin' right for the last thirty days
Now, and when I come home after noon my meals is not ready
And you know how I'm a man who can't stand such as that
I want to eat when eating time comes
And shu- sugar, now listen here, you sure is worrying my mind
I want you to stop that because you gon', you gonna find everything outdoors

Every evening, half past eight
I'm laying around rich man's gate

Workin' and studying, thinkin' out the plan
How to get that biscuit out that rich man's hand

Rich man's hand, rich man's hand
How to get that biscuit out the rich man's hand

Listen women, tell me what in the world is the matter with you
You is actin' awful funny, gal, you actin' plumb naughty
Now listen, I'm gonna tell you one thing, I ain't gonna tell you no more
You've gotta use a new system, baby, the way you've been actin' the last thirty days
Now, if you don't, tonight when you come home you'll find a moon wagon
At your gate and your clothes at the front gate
And the man sittin' up there, Lord, he wont quit
And, honey that's all

You needn't think, babe, 'cause you're black
I ain't gonna beg you to take me back

Then I went a-walkin' down the line
To see would this woman change her mind

She turned round two or three times
""Take you back in the winter time"""
6,Blind Lemon Jefferson,Booster Blues,TRKUNOI128F429F3AF,1926,"Honey, my left foot itchin', somethin's goin' on wrong
My right foot itchin' mean I just can't be here long

I thought I'd write, but it's the best to telephone
I say I thought I would write, it's best to telephone
For that fast mail train can carry your sugar so far from home

Girl, I can't live right, I ain't gon' try no more
Well, I can't live right, ain't gon' try no more
This woman's left town and she ain't comin' back no more

I went to the depot and I set my suitcase down
Well I went to the depot and set my suitcase down
I thought about my baby and the tears come rollin' down

I said, ""Ticket Agent, how long is your train been gone?""
Oh, I said, ""Ticket Agent, how long's your train been gone?""
Say, ""Yonder go the train that your fair brown left here on""

I couldn't buy no ticket but I walked on through the door
I couldn't buy me no ticket but I walked on through the door
Well my baby's left town, she ain't comin' here no more

I got up this mornin', my sho' enough on my mind
I say, I got up this mornin' with my sho' enough on my mind
Had to raise a conversation with the landlady to keep from cryin'

Excuse me, woman, I won't say this no more
I say excuse me, woman, I won't say this no more
I'm fixin to leave town and hang crepe on your door"
7,Sippie Wallace,I'm A Mighty Tight Woman,TRHKTCY128F9309AEF,1926,"I've come to you sweet man
Falling on my knees
I've come to you, pretty papa
Falling on my knees
To ask, if you ain't got nobody
Kind darlin', take me please

'Cause I'm a mighty tight woman
I'm a real tight woman, I'm a jack of all trades
I can be yo' sweet woman an' also be yo' slave
I can do things so good
'Til you will swear that I have a halo over me

I hear ev'rybody saying
That I'm tight in ev'rything that I do
I've got all the men cryin'
I'm a broad that never feels blue
All I want is a good man
And I will make him happy too

If you a married man
You ain't got no business here
'Cause when you out with me
I might make yo' wife shed tears
'Cause I'm a mighty tight woman
And there is nothin' that I fear"
