0,Pennywise,Waste of Time,TRNKPCU128F428A4EC,1995,"I got a question, for all you sinners 
Have you ever wondered is this all there is to life? 
A quick adventure, not much to mention 
A slow procession leading us to die! 

Is there a heaven, a distant valley,
A golden meadow waiting for us in the sky? 
No one right answer, spirit seems broken 
Still I just can't help but wonder why?
Seems like a tragic waste of time, 
Who cares what happens when you die? 
Life's too short to wonder why,
Get on with your life 

In towering churches, and holy temples 
They all conspired to tell me how to live my life,
But no religion, or new theism 
Could ever provide proof to quench my mind
And now I wonder, who's sky I'm under 
Is there a heaven waiting for me when I die 
No one right answer, spirit seems broken 

Still I can't help but wonder why 
Seems like a tragic waste of time 
Who cares what happens when you die? 
Life's too short to wonder why 
Get on with your life 

So many questions I can't tell the difference 
Too many abstract thoughts now wrestle in my mind 
Through the darkness somewhere should be waiting 
A final truth to shower me with light 
Their pearls of wisdom, and tales of glory 
They feed me nicely until I found it was all a lie 
No one right answer, spirit seems broken 
And still I can't help but wonder why?

Seems like a tragic waste of time 
Who cares what happens when you die? 
Life's too short to wonder why 
Get on with your life 

Your life!"
1,Radiohead,Street Spirit (Fade Out),TRYORLV128F4252D01,1995,"Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again
And fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes

All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love"
2,Zeni Geva,Burn Your Flesh Out,TRCQPYK128F425843D,1995,"The light explodes, darkness blows up
Agony thrusts through your retina
What can you see beyond it ?
That's your last ?

Time explodes, the sky blows up
Scream thrusts through your eardrum
What can you hear beyond it ?
That's your last ?"
3,Alannah Myles,Family Secret,TRXHUWP128F92E80D5,1995,"Sweet breeze, blowin' through a summer dress 
Seen from a window above 
Captured in the eyes of love 

Shivers, in the cool forbidden dawn 
Where the Iris and Jasmin run wild 
She was young and he was a child 

He vanished like July 
Some folks, they wondered why 
But old money has its friends 
Ain't it funny how the truth will bend 

It's the family secret, don't pass it on 
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong 
It's the family secret of her mystery... 

Whispers, how they sound like raindrops 
Hush now we'll make it alright 
She's framed by the front porch light 
Uuuhuh, suspicion, raising up like dragonflies 
They say there's a story to tell 
Buried in the family well 

Now the congregation prays 
Save us from our evil ways 
But old money has its friends 
Ain't it funny how the truth will bend 

It's the family secret, it's the family secret, don't pass it on 
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong 
It's the family secret, just let it be 
I know the secret of her mystery... 

It's the family secret, it's the family secret 
It's the family secret, don't pass it on 
Daddy's angel 'til something went wrong 
It's the family secret, just let it be 
I know the secret to her mystery 

Keep it in the family now, behind closed doors 
Past the rows of cypress trees, through the Spanish moss 
Those old stone walls 
It's the family secret, it's the family secret"
4,Sophie B. Hawkins,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,TROLQBF128F427276F,1995,"Virgil Cain is my name
And I served on the Danville train
Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry
Just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond had fell
It was a time I remember oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went... ""La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la""

Back with my wife in Tennessee
One day she came to me
""Virgil, Look, come see! There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Well I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
But you take what you need and leave the rest
And they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went... ""La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la""

Like my father before me
I am a working man
And like my brother above me
I took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen
Proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood beneath my feet
You can't raise the cane back up when it's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing

(La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la)

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing

(La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la)

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la..."
5,Broken Hope,Pitbull Grin,TRNDVUI128F934ABF0,1995,"A beast spawned from a deadly lineage
Maiming impulses descend
Instilling urges to mutilate
Tiny brain only programs rage
Horrendous jaws bite down on your wetting crotch
Unrestrained chompers bite clean to the bone
Lips curl back to reveal a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws locking down, never let go
With a rabid instinct it viciously shakes you apart
Fierce teeth flash as it furiously growls
Soon you will feel the agony of its piercing jowls
Easily it rips out your soft, fleshy throat
It bites your naked face and goes berserk
Bones break friend is a canine nightmare
Blood lust is the nature of this beast
It only knows its own intercine ways
Torn and biting like a human chew-toy
Lips quivering, curling back, revealing a pitbull grin
It relentlessly pounces with inhuman aggression
Tooth and nail gouge making you a masticated mess
The dog backs away as you lay and die
It can now take its time to play
Your terminal distress is the pitbull's amusement
It possess a very sick sense of humor
But before you endure any more pain at the teeth of the animal
Your luck comes in as your bloodless heart stops
Your punctured eyes take in one last fanging sight
The threatening attack of a snarling, toothy muzzle
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws lock down, never let go
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin"
6,Lee Roy Parnell,Heart's Desire,TRMUROS128F4292F64,1995,"I can't think straight
Girl you're always on my mind
It's keepin' me up late
Can't even get to work on time

Got a fever burnin' up inside
I see your face each time I close my eyes

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

You walk by I can barely speak your name
You bat your eye and my courage goes down the drain
My chest is poundin' and I must confess

Girl, you're givin' me a cardiac arrest

You're my heart's desire, always thinking of you
Heart's desire, girl I want you so bad
Like a car spinnin' out of control with a blown out
Tire
You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you
Heart's desire, best I never had
Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire

Like a sweet tooth craving candy
I got such a longing I can hardly stand it

You're my heart's desire, I do believe I love you

Got a yearning down deep and I don't want to put out
The fire
Cause you're my heart's desire"

I love you
I need you.

I want you

Tell you a story, straight from my heart

8,Chris Isaak,Go Walking Down There (LP Version),TRCMDVC128F4280C1E,1995,"I go walking down there, I go searching down there,
There's nothing left for you and me.
I go walking down there, I go searching down there,
But nobody there remembers me.

It dosen't matter now to me cause I lost my baby.
Nothing means that much to me without my baby anyway.

Oh. Oh. Oh.Oh Look at all you lucky people, think of all the things you do.
Look at all you happy people, wish I could be like you. Oh.Oh.Oh.Oh.Oh.Oh

I'm just an ole' jukebox junkie
Spendin' my time, spendin' my money
Feedin' this habit with hardcore country
I'm just an ole' jukebox junkie
I can't stand to hear the music stop
I keep droppin' my quarters in the slot
I play every song from A to Z
I'm just an ole' jukebox junkie 

Some are dancin' fools, some are hooked on booze
Some get their fix on an ole' bar stool
A handful of quarters is all I need
It don't take much to satisfy me 

(Repeat chorus) 

I lose control, I can't say no
I play 'em fast and I play 'em slow
I like the sound that a jukebox makes
It's an ole' habit that I can't break

Spendin' my time, spendin' my money
Feedin' this habit with hardcore country

11,Five Fingers of Funk,The Mindstraights,TRYYJKB128F421D3A0,1995,"Kids are caught going the wrong way Mindstraights tapping you
Worried in a flurry about the clout and kids capping you
Only thirteen another dream seems unreachable
Reality's a salary morality's unreachable
Look at his environment what stimulates learning
A look in a book or real cash money earning
Yearning for a fast break papes and all that
Hard work is for jerks what kind of life do you call that?
He takes a look around the neighborhood is good and run down
Last night a kid got gunned down 'cause there's money after sundown
Wants to get his share so he dares to take a bold step
Knowing where he's going showing a grill a right and a cold left
He doesn't need school to act a fool and create cash
Getting juice like Tropicana clocking a grand and a fan with each flash
And smoke from the flamer gaining game at a high rate
Now he spends all his time on a climb to a high state
The Mindstraights
A brief look around reveals the reason for the Mindstraights
Conditioned by living a life that's given to find papes
The only indication of respect success happiness
And if they don't find that they find stress
The quest for the look pollutes the young mind quick
""I've got a target on my back and a gun on my hip""
There's no peel under my heel and I'm not trying to slip
He's straight fighting tooth and nail just to get that grip
He came equipped and flipped on the next one
Gun to face laying waste or just to test one
Run scadaddle or battle and show some heart kid
Or come to where I live and get torn apart quick
It takes just a second of thought to get a knot or shot
Or get caught by a rock or be taught
The rules of respect step the hard not the kind way
He's baffled when he's gaffled by the judge and assigned days"
12,Trisha Yearwood,I Wanna Go Too Far,TRKNIIN128E079174B,1995,"Everything in moderation
That's the way it's always been
Never gettin' out of control
Never hanging it out, always reelin' it in.

I saved my money for a rainy day
But now I've had enough of playin' it safe
I wanna go too far, I wanna go too fast
Somebody draw the line so I can blow right past.

I wanna spend too much
I wanna stay too late
I'm gonna roar too loud
I'm gonna be that way
I wanna play too hard
I wanna go too far.

I'm the one they all depend on
Sensible, predictable and strong
But every now and then
I feel like I've played that role too long.

I need to rock the boat
I need to speak my mind
Just this once
Let it all unwind.

I wanna go too far, I wanna go too fast
Somebody draw the line so I can blow right past.
I've gotta set this spirit free that's hiding here inside
I feel like a bird in a cage, it's time for me to fly. yeah, yeah

I wanna spend too much

14,Collective Soul,She Gathers Rain  (LP Version),TRILFEK12903C9AAB7,1995,"Today she dresses
For the change she faces now
And the storm that's raging
A safe haven she has found
She doesn't care
What the prophets say anymore
For the love she had
She has no more

So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To rinse away all her guilt and pain
So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To wash and cleanse and make her whole again

Her imagination
Has started stretching wide
And her new convictions
No longer will she hide
She's not branded
When the prophets speak words of fire
The same love she gives
She requires

So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To rinse away all her guilt and pain
So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To wash and cleanse and make her whole again.

For the love she had
She has no more

So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To rinse away all her guilt and pain
So she gathers rain
Yeah she gathers rain
To wash and cleanse and make her whole again.

So she gathers rain

Year Released: 1995

Playing Time: 3:09     

A candy coloured clown they call the sandman,
Tiptoes to my room every night,
Just to sprinkle star dust and to whisper,
""Go to sleep everything is alright;""

I close my eyes and I drift away,
And to the magic night I softly say,
A silent prayer, like dreamers do,
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you;

In dreams I walk with you,
In dreams I talk to you,
In dreams you're mine, all of the time,
We're together in dreams, in dreams;

But just before the dawn,
I awake and find you gone,
I can't help it,
I can't help it if I cry,
I remember when you said ""goodbye"".

It's too bad that all these things,
Can only happen in my dreams,
Only in dreams,
In beautiful dreams,
Only in dreams,
In beautiful dreams."

De los placeres prohibidos sabrás que no me privé.

Con lo que bebí anoche,
Y, esta mañana, ¡Me muero de sed!

Mi cabeza es una noria que no para de girar,
Mi lengua es un trapo viejo. No me puedo levantar.
Hay una cosa que no puedo entender;
Con lo que bebí anoche,
Y, esta mañana, ¡Me muero de sed!
¡Me encuentro fatal!
Y empiezo aodiar la bebida
¡Pero me da igual!, sólo se vive una vez.

Hay cosas que no recuerdo
¿Qué demonios hice ayer?
Siempre estoy metido en lios por mi afición a beber.
Hay un pendiente en mi coche y no sé de quién es,
Con la resaca de anoche mañana lo pensaré.

Hay una cosa que no puedo entender;
Con lo que bebí anoche,
Y, esta mañana, ¡Me muero de sed!¡Me encuentro fatal!

And life limped along at subsonic speeds

I always said I'd be by myself
Never wanted no man's money
Didn't need no help
There was a time I was all for love
But all it took was one heartbreak and I'd had enough

Just when I thought I had no reason
You come along and showed me life has just begun

(Chorus)
Didja know, I would go
Anywhere you roll cause with you it's home
Didja know it, didja know it
Didja know it, didja know it
Does it show, When I'm low
You could ask me to smile and Id do so
Didja know it, didja know it
Baby Didja know it?

Didn't you know

I can't believe your treatin' me this way
All the words I need to be hearin'
Are the ones you say
Finally I got someone on my side
Never leave when times get hard
cause we got nothing to hide

Just when I thought I had no reason
You came along and showed me life has just begun

(Chorus)

I think it's time I let you know
Wherever you are is where I'll go
No matter how far you go I'll show
Cause it's all about you
I think it's time I tell you baby
That I'll be your one and only
Cause when I'm with you it's like
Heaven on earth

Oh no Oh no
Didn't ja know

Living in a big town now, and it's breaking me down

I get up in the morning after a sleepless night
Neighbours were drinking and putting up a fight
Cars outside my window driving all night long
Some youths are in the backyard and they messing around (with me)

Tired and frozen I crawl up on the floor
Take a cup of coffee, head for the door
There's a man in the stairway drunk and asleep
He's that kind of man that won't look before he leeps

Chorus

I walk out through the staircase, my car had flat tyre
I don't like this ratrace protect by barbed wire
I said to myself: I've got to be stronger
Put yourself in my place I can't take it no longer

Stained glass laughter peering through 
Walking with the sand on fire
Ten torches burning through

Reveal to us, what we should do
We are so alive
We are so inspired

When we were young we were careful and prudish
Now we are creased we're trivial and foolish
When we were young we were prayerful and prudish
Now we are wise we're waltzing on fire."

Philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavor)

Check it, yo!
I always hit the tape with a rough road style
You heard the psychedelic and ya came from miles
Keep my rhymes thick like a Guinness brew
So you could call me black and tan when I'm a wreckin' a crew
I'm like Bill Lee writin' when he's in Tangiers
And now I'm on a soul safari with my Beatnik peers
Analog reel and a little distortion
Smokin' on somethin' s'you could say I'm scorchin'
I never been the type to brag but beware
I'll make a man burn his draft card like it was Hair
Send ya up the river like you lookin' for Kurtz
I got the mugwump jism up in every verse (verse, verse, verse, verse)

I always hit the apple when I'm going to shoot
So you can call me William Tell or Agent Cooper to boot
Mr. Mojo Risin' on the case again
So tell your mother and your sister and your sister's friends
Like an exterminator running low on dust
I'm bug powder itchin' and it can't be trussed
Interzone trippin' and I'm off to Annexia
I gotta get a typewriter that's sexier
My name is Justin that's all that's it
And I'll be spittin' rhymes wicked like it ain't for this shit
Houses of the Holy like Jimmy Page
But the Song remains the Same so I'm stuck in a rage
Just like Jane when she's going to Spain
I think I'm going away tomorrow, just a fool in the rain
Light up the candles and bless the room
I'm paranoid, snow blind, just a black meat fool

Tryin' like hell to not blow my cover

Tryin' like hell to not blow my cover

Never been a fake and I'm never phony
I got more flavour than a packet of macaroni
Rock drippin' from my every vowel
I've got the soul of the sixties like Ginsberg's Howl
Shootin' mad ball and I'm always jukin'
Take you to the hole and I'm surely hoopin'
Top of the pops like the Lulu show
I'll take a walk on Abbey Road with my shoes off, so
I got a splinter though, damn, you know man it hurt
I got a Vegemite sandwich from Men at Work
I keep minds in line, but time sublimes
So when you search you find something like a gold mine
A psychedelic meandering's in the poem
I got a pad up any place that I roam
Waiting for the sun on a Spanish caravan
Solar eclipse and I'm feeling like starin' man

Got somethin' on his tongue and it's startin' to stain
Sho' nuff equip so wop n'get down
Step up on my ladder and you'll get beat down
Hash bar style so I'm singin' dayglow
Wakin' up the dead like Serpent and the Rainbow
Jeff Spicoli roll me another hey
The Fish that Saved Pittsburgh with Dr. J
Shockin' your ass like a faulty vibrator
Hear me now, but you'll probably get the vibe later
Who knows where the wicked wind blows
Que será será, just leave it alone
Great Space Coaster toast up the town tinker
Makin' midgets with my man Dr. Shrinker
Pass the hookah, throw down the pillows
Cloth on the ceiling, blow rings that billows
Kick off the shoes and relax your feet
Now roll up your sleeves for this lyrical treat

Yeah, I only smoke weed when I need to,
And I need to get some rest. Yo, where's the cess?
I confess, I burned a hole in the mattress,
Yes yes it was me, I plead guilty,
And at the count of three I pull back the duvet,
Make my way to the refrigerator,
One dry potato inside, no lie,
Not even bread, jam,
When the light above my head went bam.

I can't see, something's all over me,
Greasy. Insomnia; please release me,
And let me dream about making mad love on the heath,
Tearing off tights with my teeth,
But there's no relief,
I'm wide awake in my kitchen,
It's black and I'm lonely.
Oh if I could only get some sleep?
Creaky noises make my skin creep,
I need to get some sleep.
I can't get no sleep."

And left me to die like a fox on the run

Now everybody knows the reason for my fall
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride


Like a lonely fox, boys, I need a place to hide

See your life reflected in my painted eyes
These memories are hard to shake
I pressed my lips against your trembling flesh
And waited for your back to break
You liar, you coward, you sleeping fool
Don't you know that secrets kill
Heaven and hell are right here on Earth
Decided by your own free will

Tears for what might have been
Unfinished business, crawling out of the woodwork

To conquer the throne 
In shelter of darkness

Your phone call from Montreal said
I was back into you
But as I listened to the words fall
I treaded as the artist drew
Me down on my knees with liquid eyes begging please
Won't you stay for another course
But if I was you, I'd agree with what you chose to do

(All)
And I tried and tried and tried that night
I cried and cried so that we would fight
And distance was the accomplice that saw me lose

(Jian)
The most that I ever knew,
Everything, if not the sun
In the space that could handle two
You were gone.

You gave me your heart and habits
Proverbially at my side
And though maybe I took advantage
You know I never really lied
I was out in the field collecting strength for my shield
And I misplaced what made me real
I can't ask you to wait around
But you know, you can't deny

(All)
That I tried and tried and tried that night
I cried and cried so that we would fight
And distance was the accomplice that saw me lose

Everything, if not the sun

I'm lying on a bench
thinking of a book I read

I hear footsteps coming closer
it's an ordinary man
He comes up to me, shakes my hand
and asks me who I am

I'm paralysed, I can't talk or move

and before I have the chance to think
I tell this man my name

Connected to my brain this other me is
Slowly taking over deep beneath the
Eye that
All can see energic visions of the one
I know myself to be

Look into my eyes don't listen to their lies

How can I stop this from being real
No my life will be no longer what it always
Used to be

Life neglected infected by strain
I fall into the smothering the even
Flow of
Ravaging pain this my temple of selfcaged
Contempt a body slowly pierced by
Inevitable me

Do I differ from yourself am I like
They say
The truth eventually I'm the one you
Wanna be
Can you feel the same as I another inside
Pushing to free itself from the chains
Of the soul

Turn your eyes toward the inside
Dig deep within I'm sure you'll find
A different self a different soul
To put you in peace with mind"

Warriors from the north
Died beneath their enemies blade
And ended with defeat

Now a spell on the castle dwells
And breeds inside the walls
And awakens from a timeless sleep....
Demons from the kingdoms of hell

Through the land that they once possessed
They ride on the nightside storms
And watch over a thousand seas
With eyes made in another world

Blood seeders, flying
Above the mountain sides
Searching for the blood they lost....
Searching for revenge

A long time to keep a satisfyin' 
When ??? 
I glide like a trolley 
Flow like a leaf 
I fall like a feather 
But find no relief into action 
Well I'm cashin' 
Well I forgot your name baby 
And thats why I'm askin' 
Whoah whoah whoah 
Now I know where i stand 
Above reality ??? 
Sometimes I gotta settle down 
With a comic book 
And a soda pop 
And a soda pop 
Lemon soda pop 
Hey thanks a lot"

71,Necromantia,The serpent and the pentagram,TRVTTTZ128F933BD36,1995,"Spiritual bonds and scared oaths
Malevolent spells carved on pagan flesh
Paranormal symbolism of chaos
And the serpent crawling in dark paths

In the mirrored chateau of the Worm
Daimonia dance in pentagrams
And a Sumerian wizard's chanting
Mental spellbinding rhapsodies

The serpent is now fire
And the pentagram is one

Visions stream from ruined temples
Where shapeshifting witches fornicate
Poisoned by the ruby elixir
Made by the dreams of burning infants

Like profane whispers to the moon
Are the secret ways the Ravens pray
A carmine litany in reverse
For the spirits of the Unpure

Typhona, Leviathan, Jormungand, Tiamat
Bless me with your venom
And touch me with your soul"

West of the wall our dreams can all come true
Though we're apart a little while
My heart will wait until we both can smile
That wall built of our sorrow
We know must have an end
Till then dream of tomorrow
When we meet again

West of the wall where hearts are free
West of the wall your heart can come to me
And in my arms that hold you tight
You will forget the darkness of the night
The world knows about sadness and we are not alone
West of the wall that soon will fall and you'll come home

Wall built upon sorrow
One day you will end
Hearts true to each other
Will not break
They will not bend
In our hour of sadness
How clearly we can see
Tomorrow's gladness
Free, free, free, free

West of the wall where hearts are free
West of the wall your heart can come to me
And in my arms that hold you tight
You will forget the darkness of the night
The world knows about sadness and we are not alone
West of the wall that soon will fall and you'll come home

Come home

74,Home Grown,Surfer Girl,TRVJGDU128F428A2E7,1995,"I was at the beach, sittin on the sand
When I saw this girl, dark brown eyes and a dark olive tan
She was watching the sets with a surfboard underneath her arm
The first moment I saw her I knew she'd do me some harm
She's so good

She came out of the water with the best session I'd seen
Man she had the biggest chi chi's I had ever seen
She put down her board, and sat down next to me
And played a soft ole lonely tune on her ukulele

I dont know what had happened, but I'd fallen asleep
The next morning I woke up, she was sleeping next to me

Chorus:
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her,AAAAHHHH Im so in love with her
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her, AAAAHHHH my little surfer girl

She got out of bed and waxed up both our boards
Grabbed me by the hand and then she took me out the door
We surfed all that day long, at least eight hours straight
Man I knew that she was the one and damn I couldn't wait

Well I asked if she loved me
She said, ""Yea well I guess""
So I asked her to marry me, dammit you know she said ""Yes""

Chorus:
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her,AAAAHHHH Im so in love with her
AAAAHHHH I fell in love with her, AAAAHHHH my little surfer girl

I was at the alter, in my tuxedo-o-o
Waiting for my surfer girl, man where did she go?
Later on that day, a friend of me did tell-ell-ell
That she went to Mexico,to catch a, to catch a, to catch a 10 foot swell
Ah That Bitch!

I fell in love with her, Im so in love with her

Such a joke I've played on me
I let you go
And now I know a world of uncertainty

Now I think about the days
When I let you down in so many ways
That's the time I want to cry
And the time I wonder why and pray

My apathy is tragedy
I'm content to stay inside
This emptiness is killing me
I can run but I can't hide

And you loved me all along
When I always did you wrong
That's the time I can't forget
And it fills me with regret always

When you think that you have won
Then your heartache's just begun

Blue period, black comedy
Love's a clown, now laugh my way
I think of you
Much more than I'd ever be willing to say

Now I don't want to pretend
I was glad to see us ending this way
That's the time I want to cry
And the time I wonder why and pray

Blue period
I'm looking for someone who
Is just like you
To help end this blue period"

Curse my soul is burning Stranded in the sweet wonderings breathing the
Pale moon silver Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life

Sometimes I feel like screaming Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind Maybe
I was born to die in Berlin

I sprinkled cocaine on the floor when no one was watching I closed
My eyes and I let myself sleep Creeps and dirty bastards, demons waitin'
by my bed There's no choice or difference, no one seems to notice

Sometimes I feel like screamin' Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feelin' my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

In a bed with a cast and a Calvados,
I don't really need nobody but myself cus
I don't love anybody but myself, thus (is this a way of defining ""monophagus""?)
I can't ever confide, please open up wide
give me extra special pleasure with love on the side.
I didn't give you anything and that's what you got. 
I wish I was different but I'm sure that I'm not.   

(I don't need nobody but myself cus
I don't love anybody but myself, thus)

For I'm the Great Blondino

We were the vacancy crusaders with our combat kits
of a toothbrush and hearts mashed in tiny bits.
Trying to regain what we never had,
smiling about the good things amidst the bad.
So we save ourselves with Bombay Saphire unsafe sex,
twenty-four hours selfdestructive wrecks.
Sober thoughts dawn again, all the way sub rosa.
Starting up again when it's already over,

but I'm the Great Blondino, not looking for a Queeno.
I'm sad I gave you nothing and that's what you got.
I wish I was different but I'm sure that I'm not.

In a bed with a cast and a Calvados
in a perpetual feverish crave of your lust
kitchenfloor bruising, freaky sofa cruising
and the early birdy balcony Campari Orangejuicing.
I guess one could say you got me mezmerized,
but what has become one should be dechotomized.
I'm sad I gave you nothing and that's what you got.
I wish I was different but I'm sure that I'm not."

Keep me around as a burden
The stillness in my eyes
Like winter late at night
I try to forget, you try not to regret

Keep me around as a friend
Try not to shut me out
I think I've done my time
The memories that I have

I'm glad that you were mine
I'm sad you were mine"

82,Jemini the Gifted One,Story of My Life,TRZZNLM128F92FC74C,1995,"Ladies and gentlemen, for this next piece
I'd like to do for you, and autobiographical
Poetical, stop-motion piece titled ""Story Of My Life""
Check this out

Check it out, I'm a start, this rhyme kinda awkward
I slide to the side and the backwards and the forwards
Tell you who I am and why I do what I do
And tell you who the hell is in my crew
I learned that early on that I would be the master of my destiny
By mastering the minds of other men who came and tested me
None of them have bested me or even come close
Some said I was the most incredible thing since sliced bread
And zippers, it ain't go to my head because I ain't no ego-tripper
Just an exceptional black man, check it out

[sings]
On the microphone I father my seed
Jemini will make your brain cells bleed

I became more than just a man when I got down with Sudan
And Nas G and Gods G and Melquon at St. John
To my suprise I ain't have to be no 5 percenter
To enter the cipher of a peace squad, so I'm saying peace, God

The story of my life (Is who I am and who I be)
And that's the story of my life (Who the hell is in my crew?)
The story of my life (Why I'm doing what I'm doing)
And that's the story of my life

I remember each September I would go around the block
To see who was chilling out, in the spot on a cot
Puffing weed, somebody had the nerver to tell me
That dough is what I need to get down with their herbs and their spices
Brother maybe you haven't heard but I'm the nicest been around
Since the days of Methusula and I'm a be around
Standing on your grave moving to harmonic melodies
The symphony that will bless me
Don't press up, don't push up, don't test me
It's strange but I'm always in a verbal exchange
Brothers jel and they sweall and I'm forced to ring they bell
This is why Jemini looks high in the sky
And says a prayer, cause evil is lurking everywhere
I give praise to my mom, she made a beautiful child
And to my pops cause they gave me the most beautiful smile
You've ever seen, watch it gleem in the sunlight
One left, one right, the story of my life

The story of my life (Will I keep a sense of self?)
And that's the story of my life (Will I change with my wealth?)
Will I be the type of man to make my momma proud? [x2]

My recognized realized beneath the crest of my dome
A gift to use swift words in a poem like Fashion
This became a tune as youth smashing up your session
Getting steady progression, and made this my profession
I picked up an ear for the kick and the snare
And percussion, which sent my blood rushing
Through my vessels, when I be busting
MC's down from building to block
To borough I was thorough when it came to my theories
Of conjecture, so check the, audio projector
Of soliloquies of studies, the tragedies of Sophocles
Embarks on the art with the heart of a Motzart
Iuse the every fiber of my being
Is you seeing what I'm seeing when I'm saying what I'm saying?
I'm the day to your night, the star light cause I'm bright
I'm on the left when I write and that's the story of my life

The story of my life (Who am I and who are you?)
And that's the story of my life (Who the hell is in my crew?)
The story of my life (Why I'm doing what I'm doing)
And that's the story of my life (Here's my story)

The story of my life (As I hang with my people)
And that's the story of my life (Use my skill as an equal)
The story of my life (Someone's always on the ???)
And that's the story of my life (You're blessed if you know me)"

Like the silent movie era, like with snow, like when Sal's burned down
Well, yeah, there was noise, but nothing to mark the passing on
Of that great unspoken chance we had found
Where the night's end came, well-trod and familiar
Like the Charlie Chapin walk that fades to black
And there wasn't anyone trying to sell their souls
They were only trying to buy them back 
They were only trying to buy them back 

Well, yeah, there was a Sal, he walked with bulging pockets 'round town
Either he was up to no good or he just got excited watching things burn down
Well I guess he got the idea if you hold a chunk of gold in your hand now
For once in your life you can throw some weight around
And Sal, you slimeball sell-out, how can we blame you?
We all want something to put our fingers on
And you never know the true throne that you've lost
Till the vinyl barstools are gone 
Till the vinyl barstools are gone 

If you toss around some words you might say that
Sal was carrying a torch for the mob
But the mob's gone too, yeah, the only sign of them left
Is on every screen at the multiplex, and we go there, no prob, hey
'Cause there ain't no cowboys in this Connecticut town
No, not anymore, no, not since Sal's burned down
Once you'd dip your tin cup down in the muse's watering hole
Or pioneer a new patch of common ground
Then you'd lie on your time-traveled bedroll
Quite amazed at the expansive terrain
And if anyone said that you'd never have fame and fortune, just that bar
You know you'd ride that way again 
I bet you'd ride that way again."

It was American money
So don't underestimate the power of
The dollar in your pocket

American money
And there's pictures of Washington
Falling from his pockets

Now they got guns in outer space
And nobody's going to win that race
'Cause when there's nowhere left to hide
You won't be taking sides

Though you believed in the dream
And it was waiting on every corner

21 miles to go, teeth grinding
Cold coffee and a cigarette
Strung out, hung out and driving
I'm not ready to quit yet

Oh, I'm not ready to lose
Oh, I'm tired of crawling back to you
I can feel it
Slipping away

Boiling hot, burning chrome
Neon shining on the world below
Here in this devils pit
The world I've come to know

Oh, I've seen better days
The pain of these memories
I cannot drive away

I can feel it
Slipping away

Nowhere to go from here
Nothing to lose my dear
Nowhere to go from here
We're nowhere now...nowhere now

Broken down and alone
There's nothing I can do
No excuse I can use
Deep inside this hole
Deep inside of you

Oh, I'm not ready to lose
Oh, I'm tired of crawling back to you

I can feel it
Slipping away"
93,Boy George,Il Adore,TRDFDCO128F429C03C,1995,"Mother clutches the head of her dying son
Anger and tears, so many things to feel
Sensitive boy, good with his hands
Noone mentions the unmentionable, but everybody understands
Here in this cold white room
Tied up to these machines
It's hard to imagine him as he used to be

Laughing screaming tumbling queen
Like the most amazing light show you've ever seen
Whirling swirling never blue
How could you go and die, what a lonely thing to do

Silence equals death, this is what they say
But the anger and the tears do not take the pain away
How far must it go, how near must it be
Before it touches you, before it touches me
Here in this cold white room
Tied up to these machines
It's hard to imagine life as it used to be

Laughing screaming tumbling queen
Like the most amazing light show you've ever seen
Whirling swirling never blue
How could you go and die, what a lonely thing to do

Did you ever ask those strangers what they're looking for?
Did they laugh and tell you they're not really sure?
You were hurt by love but still you came right back for more
Il adore, il adore, il adore

Thanks Mum"

You went, you took it all for granted
and you got what you wanted
I saw it and it got to me

You blow the candle out
and I can't stop you

I read, what you wrote in your book
Because of everything you took
I know I went too far

But it's just all that you are
But its not that I can't cope
And I did all that I could
I did more than I should
And I tried to think
But I'm on the brink and I tried to think"

They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

nervous and scared
he knew both the thrill and the cost
but he didn't think twice 
this amazing device
was his last chance to see
what he lost
now if time is really a river
and upstream's where he needed to be
he set his sights on the past
finished his glass
and went back in history

*Chorus*
to the casual eye its a barstool
but it's really much more than it seems
a few drinks and then
she'll be with him again 
as he sits on the time machine

like all pioneers 
he swallowed his fears
and watched the whole room fade to black
he's dying to go
but he's no fool
he knows
how hard it will be to come back
but tonight he is tired of the loney 
and tomorrow will not be the cure
so he'll just slip away 
find yesterday
and spend one more night with her

now as far as the customers can tell
he's just one more fool
who talks to himself
but every man in this place would line up
if they knew what that seat really was

Beget all faiths my crying doubt

Monolith cracks, light has flown... ha !
Your faith will fail !

Twisted war - feeding on it¹s twisted hate
Reach the end of the labyrinth
Where the nightmare¹s sin
Start from this waking dream
Screaming in the wind
Never find eternity

Or walk the darkened trail

Todos los recuerdos
Y eran mas los tristeza de tantos engaños
Que me dio vergüenza
Estar pensando en ellos

Todo el aquel cariño
Rencor y coraje
Y el amor inmenso que te profese
Se me fue saliendo poquito a poquito
Y hoy siento bonito
Ver que te olvide

Yo ya no me cuerdo
Si fue una aventura
Si fue una mentira
O habrá sido un sueño
Si en verdad o fue una locura
Que te fue arrastrando
A ser mi primer dueño

Se me fue saliendo poquito a poquito

We'll wait for our fate, 'cause nobody owns us baby
We can change, we can change your heart

Try to throw the picture out of my mind
Try to leave the memories behind, ooh, ooh

Do you know the truth, I am thinking of you too?

Someday, someway together we will be baby
I'll take and you will take your time
We'll wait for our fate, 'cause nobody owns us baby

And now you've got your own world and I guess I've got mine
But the passion that you planted in the middle of my heart
Is a passion that will never stop, stop, stop, stop

Someday, someway together we will be baby
I'll take and you will take your time (Take your time)

Pablo Escobar

Fue rey de coca - hizo platas de ojas 
Fue un gran hombre - Padrino de los pobres 
Fue un general - Mandando indios guerreros 
Era El Patron, el mero chingon

A los indios pobres, les compraba casas
A los indios fuertes, les daba armas
A los policías comprados, les dio mordidas de feria
A los jueces pendejos, le corto los pescuezos

El negócio de placer - lo supo bien 
Los indios lo corrían y los pochos lo vendían 
Los negros cocinaban y las gangas empujaron 
Polvo pa' los ricos y piedra pa' los pobres

Pinches indios pobres, que amaban el patrón
Llévame pa'l cielo patrón
El dinero es nada
Mi espíritu es todo
Patrón bendígame ven a salvarme patrón

El señor pablo escobar, fue hombre con visión
La visión de ayudar su gente propia
Hombre de familia y el padrino de los pobres
Repartió placer al mundo entero
Y ahora, ahora gente, nos vamos al panteón, para enterrar el patrón
Millones de gente lo van a extrañar
Quién? Quién Te digo? Quien nos va a cuidar?

There must be ten years difference in their ages I suppose
But you don't see any traces or sadness in the faces
Cause together they're the cowboy and the rose
Now the lone cowboy shy like a piece of humble pie
Sips a cup of coffee at the dinner where he goes
Where he waits on the lady to finish waitin' on the tables
But together they're the cowboy and the rose
She's Better Homes and Gardens he's True West magazine
How they got together the good Lord only knows
But it's not for a man to question a love that's made in heaven
And together they're the cowboy and the rose

Well the lady keeps her distance there ain't much resistance
From the rednecks and the rounders drinkin' half cups for the road
Cause a man will meet his maker if he ever tried to take her
Or come between the cowboy and the rose
She's Better Homes and Gardens...
Cause together they're the cowboy and the rose"

Satan is laughing, he is laughing at us all
Look at the toiling little man,
and then he's destroyed for no reason at all
The meek shall inherit the earth when it's dead
When all temples are ashes, and the soil bears no bread

Frogs croak, frogs croak for some
From abysses begrassed, the end will come

In the flickering of the light Satan comes to take a bite
Of what could have been my soul, but it's all turd of mole
And fouled by blind diggers I can see how it figures
You can't have what's not, and that goes for the lot

Frogs croak, frogs croak for no one
Grass reaching at you, the end has begun."

You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay.
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man"

That I kiss good-bye to never see again 

And through the fog that love creates the night is filled with all the usual mistakes 
they say you're looking lonely babe, and they've been looking too 
And hey, they might well be for you 

And by the light of cigarettes, we introduce ourselves in a way you don't forget 
I'm looking for something and anything will do 
So, hey babe, it might as well be you 

And if we go home tonight, you might find the very thing 
That come the morning light, might well have washed your mind of him 
So let me in tonight so we two losers might start to win

I want some pettin' and some spoonin' and some happy honeymoonin'

A mess of cabbage, a mess of cabbage.

How deep is the sea?
How long is forever?

My heart is beating fast
I found true love at last
I'm so optimistic 
I know this new love will last

How high is the mountain?
How far out of space?
How long could I hold you
in a lover's embrace?

Until the end of time
A love that's so divine
I'm so optimistic about
this new love of mine"

Still I would have been around
Hated to hear the sound
As you fell and punched the ground
Such as miserable suicide
Performed before my eyes
Staggering about the town
Unaware I was around

I wouldn't have you
If you wanted me to
I wouldn't have you
You wouldn't have you

Feel the dead sea
Running through your veins
A sea of mercury
Dragging you down the drain

I wouldn't have you
If you wanted me to
I wouldn't have you
You wouldn't have you

Come searching for your little girl
But she hid in her oyster shell
Stupoured and ill-humoured
You left her with the swine and swill
Didn't you?

I wouldn't have you
If you wanted me to
I wouldn't have you
You wouldn't have you"

So the holy bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
(a) new king born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new  star
Then hear a choir of angels sing
Music seemed to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
Then find no place to lay the child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
New king's born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable so all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark now hear the angels sing
New king born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day"
119,Gary Moore,With Love (Remember),TRSSBFP128F14641AB,1995,"The summer rain like teardrops on my window.
Reminds me of a time so long ago.
And through each drop of rain I see,
Within my heart you'll always be.
I pray you will remember me with love.

The golden shades of autumn all around us.
They tell me nothing ever stays the same.
And as the leaves all turn to brown,
I watch them floating to the ground.
I pray you will remember me with love.

As I look back on the springtime,
There is one day I recall.
Blankets of gold in the fields of love.
Remember, remember.

The coldest days of winter draw so close now.
You'll light the fire to keep away the chill.
And in the embers you might see,
A flame that burns for you and me.
I pray you will remember me with love.

As I look back on the springtime,
There is one day I recall.

A flame still burns for you and me.

To sin 
To try and tell you why 
I am the way I am 

You blindfold me

You teach me how to pretend 
Yeah you teach me how to bend 
Time flies 
Just like you and I 
And you are on your knees again 
Praying to something 
That I can't see 
But somehow 
You make me believe 

Lights close 
And so do my eyes 
Yeah baby you have got the power to hypnotize 
Just because this is not exactly what I thought it would be 
That does not mean that I do not still dream 

With this strength 
I will fall down and get back up 
I am young and my bones 
They just don't want to give up 
I will suck the air up 
I will push my blood up 
I will raise my feet up 
Because you know 

Times flies 
Just like you and I

121,Five Fingers of Funk,Posters,TRAXAHC128F421D3C3,1995,"Post flow flow my dome is still steaming
Passing cheap hotels toward home to get dreaming
The city sky is starless on foot because I'm carless
But the thirty block walk from the spot is not the farthest

That I've gone I move on kept company by neon
Lights 3 a.m. tonight the air is like freon
Fifty in my pocket not much but I can't knock it
Getting paid to light the mic up like a bulb in a socket

Flip the switch tonight I saw it in their eyes
The Fingers kept it live the energy never died
It wouldn't be denied 214 Burnside
We kept their heads moving even kids outside

You can see them on the street through the stage door gate
Ten o'clock even when it gets late
Pass the mic at the end of the night to Dave Queen
Then come back on Tuesday check out Sid the Tennesseans Tony

Green and Stella yeah I remember Tuesdays
No bad things now bring me back to hear the new play
I'll stay late with D.J. Sass until the next day
Fuck Key Largo take me back to the X-Ray

Take me back to the X-Ray

My fingers are frozen my coat is soaked through
My toes are past numb we've got a hundred more to do
They're only getting wetter got to get another up
Luke loads the stapler then he slaps the hammer shut

Tack tack tack down the right then the left side
If you see Five-O then you'd better step hide
Wait until they pass and come around the block again
Time to go back to work before this late night ends

Over on my left he's holding up another poster
Pushing up the corner as the staple falls close to
His index finger as his breath lingers in the air
Water trickles up his arm he doesn't seem to care

He doesn't wear gloves they make it hard to grab the paper
On a late night caper with a state of the art stapler
Damn it's getting cold but still we've got to pass the word
Plastering the poles from Hawthorne to twenty third

But not in front of Fred's or Crocodile they'll tear them down
And never cover the X-Ray's 'cause they support the sound
Luke will tack it back if it belongs to a friend
But if you cover his you'll never see your shit again so watch your

Posters...

Here we go again after the show again I've got to hit the
Streets work my feet and get my flow again
All alone and then I feel the pavement on my aching feet
Dawn will come before this trip's complete

Concrete and light rain stain the city I was born in
I hardly feel alive as the horizon whispers morning
Walking on train tracks from halls where the name's at
I wanted to clear my head but once again all of the pain's back

I'm torn between the place I'm in and where I want to be
Faith won't wait kid so what's it gonna be
Forget it and let it go take no as the answer
Or if you choose to do it better get serious as cancer

But see I took a peek and looked deep into it
And after what I saw I'm not so sure I should pursue it
Still I know a half-step is likely to be my last step
And playing live beats nine to fives so thrive or hit the casket"

Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics,
You're all on my dick hun,

Hooked up in the jazzy fifth, with the pee-wee sideburns,

Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy cuz my tongue fast,
Hoe, but that's a no-no,
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what?  I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud,
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed,
Now I be comin' around the mountain like ""Oh Susanna""

Home of the boot camp clicc,
And now it's time for rest of you muthafuckas

I'll always be in a rage

I dance to the music he makes
Chemical daze, my salvation
Destroys these losers and fakes

Swallow and suck till I'm full

Leave me alone to my own type
They say, ""Stupid is a stupid does.""

Possessed by them every day
Don't try to reach out and console me
I'll bite at what gets in my way

All I could see was ruins for miles and miles
As they unfolded right before my eyes
Like a lot of funny faces
Looking like they don't know what's going on
Searching for a home

But they're smiling now
Guess that's the only right
Wouldn't you?
Cos somebody wants them after all
Displaced final call

Good
Attention fixed we'll stop
Usual tricks

Good time to make you feel like the lucky one
You can smell good all day long
We can make your roof never leak
You've been sold

The ruins have all got better again
There are a couple of scars, better to keep them
Pick them every now and again
A little reminder, a little reminder
With a lot less pain

Interrupted back to the inbetweens
No relation to the big screen
Unlike the tiger
One of the best i've ever seen
Majestic
Quite serene
He is a beautiful beast
That eats beautiful meat"

Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep (oh)
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be the same 

Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Awakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once I knew

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep (oh)
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be, I'd never be the same

With no beginning and
Without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so (yeah)
Your eyes let me know...

When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe, I fell so deep (oh)
When I saw you
When I saw you
I'll never be, I'll never be the same..."

di cose lasciate lontano da noi

e lasciano in bocca il gusto del sale,
ti butti dall acqua e mi lasci a guardarti

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what?  Ah yeah!

Verse One: KRS-One

So here I go kickin science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
dont call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
you black people still thinkin about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!

Chorus

Verse Two: KRS

This is not the first time I came to the planet
But everytime I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form,  I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
and enters into Kwame Ture

Chorus

Verse Three: KRS-One

In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as I unload
into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

The worlds collide beyond those spaces
I'm never sure of what goes on inside

If I apologize for every crutch I've used
I guess I never would have walked inside those shoes

Be hold the world that I've been shaping
I never said that I'd belong
In other words have I been flaking
Don't you know what I would have done

If I apologize for every crutch I've used
I guess I never would have worked inside those shoes
So let me down, down, down, let it bubble all around me
Always something else to do, let me down, down, down
Let the shallowness surround me, let me drown in it

From the tint of my eyes I can see the world
Spinning like a girl never satisfied
And though it's plain to see, you don't exist for me
Don't believe every word that they say

So let me down, down, down, let it bubble all around me
Always something else to prove, let me down, down, down
Let the shallowness surround me, let me drown in it

A part of my mind never wonders still
Why it's close at hand? It's never out of sight
And though it's part of me, you're never going to see

It's not natural, if it goes against God

It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!

Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now seperate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use is capital punishment
But Jesus Christ was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus still in it
You gaze upon the cross and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using

It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, her truth is not hard
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!

So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can achieve
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct or incorrect
Take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you, why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated? Now tell me if I'm wrong
But obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus

It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, her truth is not hard
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!

Rich Nice
Yo yo...
Yo bring that back
I wanna say something on this BlastMaster session
Yo this is Rich Nice
You brothers gotta stop treating these hoes like nice girls
and these nice girls like hoes

KRS-One
True indeed, I'd like to welcome the rebirth of the Goddess
Word up it's all about knowledge of self
Yo Busta Rhymes, why don't you take the session over from here"
134,Aceyalone,Keep It True,TRQJKBI128F4274D0E,1995,"You know we keep it true		 - we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true		- we got to keep it true we got to keep
It true
We got to keep it true		    - you know what we do you know what
We do
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music	 - you know what we do you know what we do
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

This isn't really what you think it is
That is if you're even thinkin' in the first place
The first place isn't always the winner
And winnin' isn't everything
And this is not a race
I am not a android I am not a mongoloid
I am not annoyed by the void in your brain
This is not a trick son you are not a victim
You are just a man b-boyed out the game
Let me explain
Abstract are you fresh? 
Ain't nobody fresher
But it's hard to get around w/out some clown tryin' to test ya
Acey are you dope? 
Dopest in the world
I give it to the moms and pops I give it to the boys and girls
Oh so you a family man? 
Aren't we all aren't we all
Yes we are
Trying to make jams man and expand my repertoire

We got to keep it true we got to keep it true	 - relax your mind w/the music
You know what we do you know what we do	- sit back and vibe w/this true shit

Well I be arrangin' thoughts in my brain cell family
&lt;? rapidly? &gt; embarking on incredible creative routes
Understanding me is truth shining like a lie
When I say break wide I mean take trips not just in your ride
In your mind
Cause when you left you're right on time
The sun'll come out tomorrow and it'll set in the west
So I don't sweat the rest
Who wanna inhale stress
Keep it true

You know we keep it true		- we keep it true we keep it true we
Keep it true
You know we keep it true		- you know what we do you know what we
Do
We got to keep it true		  - the w the w the w
We got to keep it true
Relax your mind w/the music	 - and keep it true and keep it true
Sit back and vibe w/this true shit

The world is full of bullshitters
Liars and triers and quitters
Could-a-beens wanna be's thought-i-was isn't-i-is's
And everybody in your business
Damn
Now what is really your main aim
When you are just a blotch and a stain on the planetary plane
Just another name in the phone book of fame
Bustin' out the seams it seems you haven't gained enough
To be seen in the right scene
Your thoughts they seem so convincing hmmm
But your actions don't follow through
Remember
Never say never because it never comes true


Your thoughts they seem so convincing for instance
You told me that you're a level higher
Liar
Element of desire earth and the wind and the fire
Not
You ain't even halfway hot
Not lukewarm you don't got no form
You (...? ...)
All caught up in bein' waterproof
When you shoulda been tryin' to catch up w/the truth
For all intent and purposes your life on earth ain't worth it's weight in
Gold
That's probably why you get blowed
Cause people tell people things and people sell people things
That are useless and irrelevant
And it stifles my intelligence
I stay true

You know we keep it true  - and we keep on and keep on and keep on
You know we keep it true  - we keep it true we keep it true

You can mumble jumble if you got somethin' to say
But I doubt it's gonna affect me I row my boat steady
Everready is my battery description
Meaning I'm equipped to take long trips
And my brain cells overload when I get blowed
Gotta bring it down there's a point where the joint stops
Being passed through the fingers of a rhyme (? singers? )
The smoke from my last hit still lingers
Bring us your tired and your weary and your poor
I'm a take you higher while you're hearing metaphors
And similes
Assimilation of new creation
Mind emancipation
Rhymes command the nation
And so on and therefor and such and such
Dust to dust I thrust from the ground
W/no where else to go but up l.a. is where I'm found
Throwin' up sets and blowin' up sets and goin' up stepney
About to get a heavy track
(? or jimmy in the spot? )
Or plenty of hip hop goin' round three
Heavyweights it's your time so register
Foundate your legacy we serve all them replicas
True style true style? 
True style new style

You know we keep it true - we keep it true we keep it true we keep it true
You know we keep it true	- the w and every crew we keep it true
We got to keep it true	   -	from me to you do what you do just keep it
True
We got to keep it true    - relax your mind w/the music

Now I'm gonna take my last verse on a good note
You better prepare your footnotes
Hold your wigs tight
Open up the middle
(? center me in the more? )
Words are the foundation action is the building and unity
And the concept to result in logic and the use of logic
Now the object to be neutral partial to a judgement
And the subject's concentration here is the pop quiz
What hip hop is

You know we keep it true	- relax your mind w/the music
We got to keep it true	   -  sit back and vibe to this true shit

The wrong thing to do is stop"
135,God Lives Underwater,Try,TRJZDSX128F9323301,1995,"I can see you, but I don't know what you're thinking
I can feel you, but I don't know what you're feeling

You take me away when I look in your eyes
I can't reach you no matter how hard I try

I don't care what gets in the way
Some days I don't know what to say
I can't get this through to you
Maybe you just don't want me to try

I can touch you, but I don't know if you'll let me
If you let me, I don't know if I'll want to

You push me away and I don't come back
Sometimes it's so hard to get you to react

I don't care what gets in the way
Some days I don't know what to say
I can't get this through to you
Maybe you just don't want me to try

I can't help it, I'm too young to be truthful
Maybe I'm not good enough to deserve you

You lead me astray and I can't fight back
Can't you help me? I want you to protect me

I don't care what gets in the way
Some days I don't know what to say
I can't get this through to you
Maybe you just don't want me to

I don't care what gets in the way
Some days I don't know what to say
I can't get this through to you

136,MxPx,Summer Of 69,TREUEAZ128F1456D2B,1995,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it till my fingers bled
It was the summer of '69
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and joey got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far
Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah - I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Back in the summer of '69
Ain't no use in complaining
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you
Standin' on your mama's porch


You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Back in the summer of '69
Man we were killining time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no
And now the times are changing
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes I play that old six-string
I think about ya wonder what went wrong
Standing on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
The way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Back in the summer of '69"
137,Letters To Cleo,Pizza Cutter (Album Version),TRVXTLO128F92FA7CE,1995,"I was on youre side
and I can't believe that it's coming back to haunt me.
You were on that side too
and I can't, no I can't go back and save you.
Why didn't you do as you were told? 
Why didn't you just go home? 
And what you got in the bag? 
Non-recognition is the way to keep everything you want to hide.
You stay on that side now
'cause I won't, no I won't go back and bail you out.
Closer to the thing we had before.
And what you got in the bag? 
You were closer than you thought.
Closer than you thought you'd get. 
Don't you worry that pretty head now. 
Never thought that's what you'd get. 
Non-recognition is the way to keep everything you want to hide.
You stay on that side now
'cause I won't, no I won't go back and bail you out.

138,Gene Kelly,All I Do is Dream of You,TRORYHL128F931D824,1995,"All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on 
Dreamin' of you.
You're every thought, you're everything,
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn, and spring.
And were there more than 24 hours a day,
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away.
When the sky's are gray! When the sky's are blue!
Morning, noon, and night-time, too!
All I do the whole day through 
Is dream of you-o-u!

It's the cat's meow!

MUSIC

All I do the whole day through 
Is dream of YOU-O-U"
139,Unanimated,Ruins,TRTHHDQ12903CC80C1,1995,"ruins among laughing dreams... so real
knowledge of a wind so old... whispers through the dark
the taste of haunted words... comes forth
and pleasures a night so violent... and pure insane

statues of stone wandering
wandering among the ruins... among us

a wind through a solitude so dark
it sleeps in a path of anguish blood
thorns of steel cries in a fire of greed
of pain it leaves the day, and takes away
rivers of stone, deserts among... me

statues of of stone wandering
wandering among the ruins... among me"
