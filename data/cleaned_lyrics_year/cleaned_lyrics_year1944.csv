0,Cecil Gant,I Wonder,TRGEOTN128F9330E41,1944,"My little darling
Where can you be again tonight?
While the moon is shining bright

I wonder, my heart is aching
Why for you can our love be mistaken?
Darling, don't you say that this must mean our ending
I wonder

Baby, I've been through, I've been through lovers lane
I've been making life just the same
I've been traveling for miles around

Trying to find the one I love
Come on

I wonder, well, well, well, little baby
Will you think of me every day?
Though I may be a million miles away
I wonder

I wonder, well, well, well, little baby
Will you think of me every day?
Though I may be a million miles away
I wonder"
1,Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five,G.I. Jive,TRFQZHT128F932DFB4,1944,"This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
It starts with the bugler blowin' reveille over your bed when you arrive
Jack, that's the G. I. Jive

Roodley-toot
Jump in your suit
Make a salute
Boot

After you wash and dress
More or less
You go get your breakfast in a beautiful little caf? they call ""The Mess""
Jack, when you convalesce

Outta your seat
Into the street
Make with the feet
Reet

If you're a P-V-T, your duty
Is to salute to L-I-E-U-T
But if you brush the L-I-E-U-T
The M-P makes you K-P on the Q-T

This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
They give you a private tank that features a little device called ""fluid drive""
Jack, after you revive

Chuck all your junk
Back in the trunk
Fall on your bunk
Clunk

This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
They give you a private tank that features a little device called ""fluid drive""
Jack, if you still survive

Chuck all your junk
Back in the trunk
Fall on your bunk
Clunk

Soon you're countin' jeeps
But before you count to five
Seems you're right back diggin' that G. I. Jive"
2,Louis Prima,Oh Marie,TRUATHK12903CAA7FD,1944,"Oh Marie (Oh Marie)
Oh Marie (Oh Marie)
In your arms I'm longin' to be (Longin' to be)
Baby (Baby)
Tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Kiss me once while the stars shine above me (Shine above me)
Hey Marie (Hey Marie)
Oh Marie (Oh Marie)
In your arms I'm longin' to be (Longin' to be)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
Tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Hey Marie (Hey Marie)
Hey Sammy, come here boy"
3,Nat King Cole Trio,It's Only A Paper Moon,TRAXUOK12903CCFF56,1944,"It is only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

It is only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe 
If you believe in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played 
In a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played
In a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me"
4,The Mills Brothers,Till Then,TRPJQDT128F92D89B6,1944,"Till then, my darling, please wait for me
Till then, no matter when it will be
Some day, I know I'll be back again
Please wait, till then

Our dreams will live though we are apart
Our love, I know it'll keep in our hearts
Till then, when of the world will be free
Please wait for me

Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time

Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then

Although there are oceans we must cross
And mountains that we must climb
I know every gain must have a loss
So pray that our loss is nothing but time

Till then, let's dream of what there will be
Till then, we'll call on each memory
Till then, when I will hold you again
Please wait till then"
