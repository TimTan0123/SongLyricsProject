0,Jimmy Eat World,Ten,TRNFYND128F1456E67,1999,"We left behind the busy crowd
So it seems we slow down
Meet me with a way out through the lies
Nowhere, going nowhere in the fake yellow light

Blame no one, blame no one

The feelings change so fast
Safety scares them away
I can't bring myself to say it, it's my own advice I need
Nowhere and then nowhere, living trapped inside the chase

Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, would you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one

Our weakness is the same
We need poison sometimes

So take another drink with me

Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, could you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one"
1,Chely Wright,Rubbin' It In,TRNPPIM128E078F77F,1999,"(Chad Smith)

Last night, I went out with some old friends
I couldn't help but think of you again
Someone was wearing your cologne
What a cruel way to remind me that you're gone.

A couple danced over by the jukebox
Hand in hand, I thought they'd never stop
They played our song again and again
How could anyone be so insensitive.

They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me
Of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in.

Every time I turn on the T.V.
I come across one of our favorite movies
A love story that ends with a kiss
How'd the cable company get in on this.

I swear I pass you when I'm on the highway
Since when did everyone drive red Chevrolets
It never really is your car
I think some people have taken this a little too far.

They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me
Of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in.

They're laughing at me, I just know it
As if they knew all along I'd blow it
Everywhere I turn, something reminds me
Of the way things were
I love you, I lost you
I know what a fool I've been
And it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it in.

Yeah, it seems like the whole world keeps rubbin' it..."
2,Combat 84,Violence (Re-Mix),TRXYQCS128F92F1B01,1999,"There's rucking in the street and there's blood on your hands
Your'e boozing in the pub and going round in gangs
Cruising round in motors trying to get someone
Kick 'em stab 'em club 'em until the job is done

[Chorus]
There's violence in our town
There's violence all around
There's violence in your town
There's violence all around, around, around

People never learn however much you try
There's violence in your blood so someone's gota die
Cruising round in motors trying to get someone
Kick 'em stab 'em club 'em until the job is done

3,Deadsy,She Likes Big Words,TRXUCWS128F148AD80,1999,"She comes from the land 
Of Valencian winds 
Deciduous daydream 
Dressage round the bend 
Shes sometimes Miss Maybe 
The mistress of when 
A triptych of new touch 
From heaven to men 

She likes nice cars 
Invincible trends 
She bites the heads off 
Her mutual friends 
We dine at the table 
She sits at the end 
She likes big words 
And playing pretend 

Come now dear boys 
How where to begin 
She's Ursula Major 
Of the prism within 
She's always in parties 
She's plotting to win 
Your sashes of New-Ro 
From psychic to sin 

Let down your void 
Your need to defend 
So pseudo-mendacious 
She's cruel in bed 
You'd think she was precious 
Something like you said 
Cause she's got the secrets 
In which fate depends 
She likes the boys that meet her late by the glen"
4,IZZ,I Get Lost,TRNLXPJ128F422CD85,1999,"I get lost, I get lost
All the time, all the time

And when you look into my eyes
You have to see through my disguise
For it's to you that this one goes
Never, never will you know"
5,Sisqo,How Can I Love U 2Nite,TRWDRXQ128F148D446,1999,"Tonight
I couldn't wait to get with you

But I knew that you were wrong
Don't stop
The love is feeling good to me
And you have it all
Come give it to me baby
Cuz I know you like to bone

1 - How can I love you 2nite?
When you know that I love somebody else
And I know that you're not mine
How can I love you 2nite?
I know you're not mine

Ooh, yeah, uh listen
All night I wanna give my love to you
Come on take you deep inside
Come on baby let's ride
Ooh girl you feel so tight
Don't cum,baby please wait for me
Just think how wet we're gonna be
Let it rain on me
Ha, so sorry we can't be 
Repeat 1

Listen 
Stand in front of me
So I can see your body
Sexing you is on my mind
But loving me is on your mind
So baby why dont you give yourself to me
I know your not mine
Said I know I shouldn't say it cause I know youur not mine
Said you and and me ,girl its not the way its suppose to be
But I can't help myself ,cause I don't want nobody else

Repeat chours till beat fades!!!
Repeat 1 till end"
6,Diorama,another queen,TRLWSWN128F422AC73,1999,"Systems slaved to secrets
Wisdom unsuspecting quest
Silence holy true old friend of mine
Timid tries to race me down

Another episode of wild complains
Closes chapters of childish struggle inside
Pale naked as now thoughts cannot deny
The purpose of neglecting lies

Withered fairy all my dedication
All my love for you

Believe in the signs I draw on your skin
Secrets now told as final advice

Believe in the signs I draw on your skin
Another queen that will never rise"

(Dr. Dre)
Everyday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed
Niggaz still playa hatin, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
cause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now
Niggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin the window down (Eminem: Hey can we talk it out?)
(Hitt: NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!)
Johnny got a shotgun
and he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin to job hunt
Niggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier
than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin
Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always tryin to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!

(Knoc-turn'al)
Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin
You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Makin death not so foreign to ya
Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough,
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
BANG BANG!!

(Hittman)
Now tell me - what the fuck is this man?
Niggaz doin brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill
without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill
blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs
fillin the sky, usually drillin the one
that wasn't willin to die, yes sir in the Killing Field
I got my, life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
question me - bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
my hitlist -- peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!

9,Jill Phillips,Steel Bars (LP Version),TRTBQCW128E07853CF,1999,"So this is how it feels at the rock bottom of despair
When the house I built comes crashing down
And this is how it feels when I know the man that I say I am
Is not the man that I am when no one's around
This is how it feels to come alive again
And start fighting back to gain control
And this is how it feels to let freedom in
And break these chains that enslave my soul

CHORUS:
I refuse to be locked up in here like a prison cell
Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore
Gonna break through these steel bars

So tell me how it feels when the tables start to turn
And you find yourself at the losing end
Tell me how it feels, you're not welcome here
'Cause I'm tired of pain and I'm tired of sin

CHORUS

I won't let you win
I have no doubt
I don't want you in
So get out, get out

CHORUS

I refuse to be locked up in here like a prison cell
Where all I ever get is a meal and four walls
I used to be just fine in here but not anymore
Gonna break through these steel bars"

Mira, mira nena como yo te quiero,
No, no, no perdamos ni un minuto,
No, no, no perdamos ni un segundo

Yo soy un gato callejero y maullido tras maullido,
Me quedo bajo la ventana para darte la serenata,
Yo no me canso nunca, el sargento es vitamina,
Dame tu amor nenita, yo quiero que me des más,
Más y más, cada día más y más,
Más y más, cada noche más y más,
Y gozaremos de amor los dos durante siglos,
Si amor tengo para darte hasta que estalle el mundo.

Y mucho ruido.
Un chabon me deliró
Y un roscazo se comió,
Me echaron de la fiesta
Y me quede sin chica
Y sin cerveza.
Al rato me puse a caminar
En busca de un bar,
Y al rato lo encontré
Y mas de diez cervezas me tome.
Por la vidriera del bar
Veo mi chica y mi amigo pasar
Que van directo a ese hote
Lque esta al frente de este bar.
Pido la cuenta al mozo
No me alcanza para pagar
Yo intento despegar
Y a la seccional voy a dar.
Que mala suerte que tengo yo
Que a esa chica no la pude transar
Mi amigo se la cogio!

Is a moonlight night down in New Orleans
I'm up the river, just around the bend
I got a hole in my pirogue, I just can't hold it in

Well, Catelina's waitin' with tears in her eyes
Munchin' and a crunchin' on a crawfish pie
I smell a feeling floatin' through the air
I got a hole in my pirogue, I can't go see my Cher

The purtiest sight that you ever have seen
Is a moonlight night down in New Orleans
I'm up the river on around the bend
I got a hole in my pirogue, I just can't hold it in

Yeah I'm here on the bayou, sittin' all alone
With a busted bottom and I can't pole it home

Al filo de la mañana. ¡Qué frío!
Que no me he puesto el sayo
Pero me he puesto como un rayo
Me siento como un esperma esperando
En un tubo de ensayo

Congelado pero vivo
Se rompe el hielo si tiro un suspiro
Que no hay nadie más por la calle
Que yo sólo pienso en canciones
Que una poesia me sale
Porque se me caen los pantalones
Y es que se me escapa el aire

Porque me falta el aliento
La fuerza, la pasta, las ganas de verte
El encanto, la salsa, la luz de mis ojos
Mi as de la manga, tus ojitos rojos
Me faltan, me faltan

Madrugada de hielo
Alguien que se arrastre a ras de suelo
Ya debe entrar el sol
Por tu ventana azul
Y yo en el ascensor
¡Qué cara, que estúpida expresión!
Menos mal que ya no estas tú...

Tengo un reloj que se para
Siempre que tú de mí te separas
Y anoche se paró a las dos
Las dos nos paró a los dos
Que ya no hay tiempo que transcurra
Ni sudor que se me escurra por tu cuerpo
Ahí donde curra mi silencio
Mis manos, mi boca, mis ganas, mis besos
Mi cabeza loca, mi tema, mis sueños
Te digo por qué..."

Your eyes hurt til your money's gone
You got left at the dead end son

Thought you made it to the final day
Now you're gonna have to run away
That's a lie and a cheat
Takin the world

Heart is racing and your head explodes
No one ever gets it no one knows
Evil like a demon out of hell
In a tale you won't live to tell

Look what crawls in
Now I'm trying to keep my head
Above your dead pool
Deep end

In on the joke of the spin
But this burned-in cynical grin
Is fading again
Turning the hooks
To catch nothing
I'm let off
You live in your head
And love no one
At all
Spotlit marks for your
Self-styled, comic book
Sharpshooter
Blind spots before
I sold myself in

To steal and refine

Wide of the mark
Pressed to define
Connect the dots

So sitting and waiting is a waste of time
Things are getting better, forget about the weather

Same old, same old hunt and chase
I'm coming right at you, in your face

Huckey
Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass so was möglich sein kann, 
aber jetzt weiß ich es, und ich zweifle nicht mehr daran.
Einen Großteil der Leute kannst du immer vergessen, 
die würden alles aufgeben, für ein Zimmer und was zu essen. 
Sie schmeißen ihre Ideale weg und hinken Parolen hinterher, 
steigen blind in die Falle und vor Schreck sehen sie das, was sie wollen nicht mehr.
Sie wären zu Allem bereit, auch wenn´s zu weit geht, 
und planen die Hinrichtung, folgen denen wo´s leicht geht 
und drehen ihre Fahnen je nach Windrichtung. 
Und wenn das so ist, dann können wir´s gleich bleiben lassen, 
denn wenn das deine Freunde sind, wie müssen dich erst deine Feinde hassen? 
Und dann kommst du mit schlechten Slogans und viel Geschrei, 
aber bei deiner Revolution war plötzlich keiner dabei, 
und wenn ich dir so zuschau, dann fress ich einen Besen mit samt der Putzfrau, 
wenn du jemals ernst gemeint hast was du sagtest, dachtest und tatest. 
Das Glück auf das du wartest kommt nicht von selbst, 
und die Leute haben begonnen in die falsche Richtung zu laufen, 
denn das was wir wollen, ist oft nicht das was wir wirklich brauchen. 
„Das weiß ich auch inzwischen“, hör ich dich durch deine Zähne zischen, 
„die Drogen logen und die Revolution haben wir verschoben, aber glaub mir sie passiert!“ 
„Ach, ich glaub dir gar nichts, egal was wird.“
„...und wo warst du? Warum bist du nicht dabei gewesen?„
„Ich war zu Hause, Texte schreiben und Bücher lesen, 
denn das ist keine Reise auf einem Traumschiff. 
Wichtig ist, dass du mit den richtigen down bist, 
sonst bekommst du den blauen Brief von den Kriegssüchtigen, 
berühmt und berüchtigten Verfechtern einer ohnehin fragwürdigen Ideologie.“
Deine Revolution verreckte im Wohnzimmer und passierte natürlich nie.

Skero
Was ist bloß passiert mit deinem Revoluzergeist? 
Auf einmal willst du Sicherheit wie Embrios im Mutterleib. 
Glaub nicht, dass ich deinen Weg unterschreib.
Geprägt von Futterneid, es tut mir Leid. 
Alles was du angekündigt hast, fand nicht statt 
und jeder der dir vertraut hat wurde abgefuckt. 
Nur ein Hampelmann springt auf, wenn man die Fäden spannt 
und Veränderung kommt nicht über Nacht, sondern lebenslang.

Ich steh nicht auf Monopole, Monologe, die neueste Modedroge. 
Monotones Gefasel bringt mich schon lang in Rage. 
Ist das Leben nur Fassade, frage mich: „Wo sind die Grenzen?“
Dass jeder sich am nächsten steht, scheint Grundprinzip des Menschen. 
Denk nach: Benutzt du nicht auch einen Schutzschild, 
härter als Asphalt, damit alles abprallt? 
Natürlich weißt du, dass weltweit viel falsch rennt. 
Drum bist du Abfall-Trenner, Geld an Dritte-Welt-Länder-Spender, 
bist nur ein Blender, änderst Tatsachen und Fakten,
tarnst dein wahres Ich und verschanzt dich hinter Masken 
und Images so seicht wie Gequatsche in Talkshows. 
Je lauter alle schreien, desto mehr werden sie wortlos und wertlos, 
der Schmerz ist groß, den ich empfinde. 
Manche Dinge im Leben hören oft nur Taube und sehen nur Blinde. 
Ich will keine Kriegslist, keine Fallen. keine Täuschungsmanöver,
keine Hippies die nichts schnallen, keine falschen Erlöser, 
keine braven Ehemänner, die heimlich ihre Töchter ficken, 
keine Abtreibungsgegner, die ihre Söhne in den Krieg schicken, 
keine schicken Häschen, die sich am Häuschen ihr Näschen pudern, 
keine frustrierten Looser, die über gescheiterte Revolutionen sudern. 
Brech lieber auf zu neuen Ufern, als zu alten Ideen, 
denn nur in verkalkten Gehirnen bleibt die Zeit ewig stehen.

I come knocking at your door to dry the tears away,
The eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes,
Pull me on and make me mesmerized!

Riding on the wings of light,
Dreaming dreams and holding tight:
Leaving all my sorrow far behind,
Your eyes are the gate

To the land of the miracle
Where our love can make us fly, make us fly,
In the land of the miracle,
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.

Open up the book up madness read the page of life!
Who's the one to tell you what to do and how to rise?
And if the stars would fall one day I'd climb up the sky
To put them back for you to save your smile.

Dreaming dreams and holding tight:
Leaving all my sorrow far behind,

And you will see: what you can feel is everything
You need to heal your crying mind, the soul behind
And everything that you may find inside your head...

For the decay and to unlearn just what we yearn 
For all day long: right to be strong and stick to
Our ideals, are they for real and do we just have lost the thread?...

In your arms a dream comes true for me...

Shining through my window pane.

I lose my nerve I'm back again.
Something holds me from behind
Moves in like a fog every time.

To get it back again.
I'm falling on my face a lot.
I don't know who to blame.

Do you remember
The room we shared on Grand St.
We'd lie there in the afternoons
Drifting in and out of sleep.
Let our minds just float away
Nowhere to be and nothing much to say.

Well I'm floating around in space
Nothing holds me in.
I know I always call you up
When I'm in trouble again.

I've watched
As dreams have come and gone.
I try to change
I'm still my father's son.
Now I wait
I wait and let it come.
Let it come.

Gets to me so easily.
A crowded room and smoky lights
Used to be enough for me.

To wake up from this dream I'm living in.

only when i'm drunk."
43,Nicolas Bacchus,Gros gland,TRUNATT12903D013D5,1999,"L'autre soir à la téloche
J'ai entendu un gros gland
J'y aurais bien mis une taloche
Mais y s'planquait derrière l'écran
M'a tellement mis la colère
Que j'aime mieux le prévenir
S'y vient traîner ici peuchère
Risque de se faire occire 

Mais le gros gland n'a qu'un oeil
Il ne voit que d'un seul côté
Il ne s'aperçoit même pas
Que les coups vont bientôt tomber
Qu'on en a marre de sa sale gueule
Qu'y commence à nous gaver
Et qu'il figure déjà
Parmi les espèces menacées.
Nous prend vraiment pour ses enfants
Y voudrait bien nous faire croire
Qu'on est un peu plus méchant
Quand on est un peu plus noir
Que tous les juifs sont des traîtres
Que tout est d'la faute aux melons
Y peut bien aller s'faire mettre
On n'est quand même pas si cons.

Refrain
Pour croire que tout irait mieux
Si on virait les immigrés
Y faut être un sacré boeuf
Et encore un boeuf pas bien futé
Si vraiment on est trop nombreux
Si on n'a plus rien à bouffer
C'est gros gland et tous ses noeuds
Qu'il faudrait charteriser 
Refrain
Quand il allait à l'école
Ou torturait en Algérie
C'était déjà pas très drôle
Les filles ne voulaient pas de lui
Depuis lors rien n'a changé
Il est toujours aussi gerbant
Il est toujours aussi LAID
Il est toujours aussi GLAND.

Refrain
Fin cosmopolite et pluriculturelle."
44,Letzte Instanz,Gebranntes Kind,TRIKQAD128F92EA581,1999,"Auf dem Bauch das kleine Wesen
Liebe schlägt in sein Gesicht
Es will nur von der Wärme leben
Weicht von der Mutters Seite nicht

Auf den Knien das kleine Wesen
Für die Welt ist es nicht bereit
Es hat schon eigene Gedanken
Doch Mutter gibt ihm Sicherheit

Bald ist es aufrecht das kleine Wesen
Kann schon auf seinen Füßen stehen
Es sieht den kalten Hals der Mutter
Und muß jetzt eigne Wege gehen

Im kalten Nass das kleine Wesen
Nicht mehr ganz klein und doch nicht groß
Hat noch die Neugier in den Augen
Will doch zurück in Mutters Schoß

Kein Weg zurück zu Mutter Erde
Der rechte Weg bleibt unerkannt
Gebranntes Kind im Schoß aus Asche
Die Kälte raubt ihm den Verstand

Jahre später es wird ein Mann
Der seine Mutter ganz innig liebt
Losgelöst vom Leib der Mutter
Er findet nichts, was Wärme gibt

Auf allen Vieren das kleine Wesen
Von Kopf bis Fuß mit Angst beschmiert
Es will zurück zum Bauch der Mutter
Weil es sonst ohne Wärme friert

Kein Weg zurück zu Mutter Erde
Der rechte Weg bleibt unerkannt
Gebranntes Kind im Schoß aus Asche
Die Kälte raubt ihm den Verstand"

Well everyone calls and asks 
Am I over you yet? 
And I tell them yes 
It's been almost a year 
It'll be a year this November 
And life is so strange, yeah 
Life can be so unbearable 

Why do I always 
Call your name 
If it doesn't stop 
I'll go insane 
I just know 

I still have our dog 
I just tell him you're 
Gone for awhile 
And nothing has changed 
I still have our 
Same old place 
And I can't stop my mind 
From wondering why 
Is it something I did 
Is it something that 
I deserve 

Why do I always call your name… 

Well I've never thought 
Of life without you 
And I'm not gunna start 
I never thought 
I'd be without you 

I can still see your face 
I remember  
The way you move 
And it's just not fair 
I'm just so lost 
Without you 
I still miss you so 
I can't let you go

To take someone like you 
From me

46,Fifteen,Liberation II,TRJWPJZ128F932098E,1999,"This is not another song about two dysfuntional people in love with each other.
And how it's just too bad they're so willing to abuse each other.
And gladly accept it from the other.
This is not a song about how it all came to an end.
And how I hope that you'll still be my friend.
Cause I don't.
And how we can't wait to get back together.
Cause it would only prove our cowardous so we must take in this thought deep.
We're all alone.
Cause there's five billion people in this world.
Maybe if you keep on trying...
You'll find the one that's just right.
I bet you'll make it through the night.
Maybe you'll find the one that's just right.
Your problems will end and you won't have to hide.
Once you've slept with everyone and it still doesn't work out, maybe you'll find the problem on the inside.
See this is a song about a boy and a girl.
Fell in love and ended the real world.
They had complementary platters from mom and dad.
But it wasn't a compromise at all.
It was perjury, it was injury, it was abuse.
It was life.
You know I have to agree it's great to say ""I love you.""
Maybe first we should find out what it means.
Cause there's five billion people in this world.
Maybe if you keep on trying...
You'll find the one that's just right.
I bet you'll make it through the night.
Maybe you'll find the one that's just right.
Your problems will end and you won't have to hide.
Once you've slept with everyone and it still doesn't work out, maybe you'll find the problem on the inside.
I've been scared of changing cause I've built my life around you.
Time makes you bolder, even children grow older.
And I'm getting older too.
Yea, I'm getting older too."

Water it down like butternut blues

Black smoke's lightening comin' up the trees

Telly myself again and again and again
Get out of this son - state of mind we're in

To clear my head

Justice lies somewhere behind...between
The have nots and the plasticine lies
Black spit twilight holograph scene

Conjured up images of apocalypse steam
Words never spoken wait on the lips
On the door step of a woman's millenium hips
Big bang wash clothes delirium
Nostradamus' imposter and one last run

Haze falls away revealing dreams
Like writing a letter to myself it seems
Garage sales, paper trails, e-mails
Junk mail there for the plans that fail

God I miss you, I miss you real bad
The only thing real that I've ever had
Halle bop, halle bop I said

48,8stops7,Satisfied (Album Version),TRYWMVF128F931BC85,1999,"Should I be safe at home
A stronger man who really should know
Better than to reach the edge and
try to fight this on my own

Can I be something I have yet
to see in my close friends
They've all lost their heads
And it's bringing me down
to the place where I'm supposed to...be
Responsibly...for now

Chorus:
I want it, I need it, just one more to Satisfy
Can't help it, feel nothing and nothing feels right

Should I be safe at home
I relapse quicker than you could know
My past compulsions breed convulsions
A sorry scene unfolds

Can I be weak when I'm stable
Strong in the cradle
Strung out in a fable 
Where the hero gets saved
I've tried this before
Routines and rewards
What's gonna change

(Chorus)

I tried to find , inside, something civilized
Stolen, borrowed, bought
Any remnants of a man
Tookon too much too soon too afraid to fight
Struggled lost and won just to realize that I can't understand

I want it I need it
I want it I need it
Just one more, just one more
Just one more to satisfy
Like nothing will
Like nothing will
Like nothing will
Like nothing will
Like,,,

Puzzled missing pieces
They don't fit in
Cant help it
Feel nothing
Feel nothing"

Countdown...
Are you ready? Are you mad inside?
Got you strapped down to your seats
Outta the doorway, bullets ripped, full clip
God speed, approach follow my lead
Firewinds gust, empire crush
Full thrust, fall in the hole, roll wit the rush
Untouchable chunk of ?air, wax and soul?
Soundwaves slay out the back, ?cave? smoke
My belly-full prance dance, avalanche quote
Down slope, elegant as Fantasia
Killer whale tale inhale, black male from Asia
All out the wood works, hood shirts and wizards
No match, unhatch, the rap is rigid
In the shaft, shotty cop, hip hop to the limit
Nightwatch, pad mark 
Sparks spin a quake nuclear blast, heavy on the cash
Gimmie what it takes NOW!!

Wit the possibility to stop your walkin ability
God forgive me, spark enemies wit pistol grips
The missile tip's impact hit you so hard, you shit through your dick
Official scripts strikes when physical hits
You physical bitch, watch for the imperial blitz, serious shit
Submit, subject to the wreck wartone, and thought poems
Liver than WWF Warzone
Walk upon ? tracks, bodies collapse
Rap for lottery stacks, shatter like when pottery cracks
Logical facts from the terror dome
Spill from the guts, trail to you ?puss? from where you bust
In God you now entrust
Dog you like hound and mutts, Pound Pups get sound struck
Clown what? You'll get drowned in the cut
While crowd round up

Travellin tremendous speed measurin far
Been bustin satellites circlin Mars
Verbal onslaught, bring forth physical force
Of a hundred wild niggas piled in a Trojan Horse
Thought method, set it on generic mic ethic
Professional neck shit, left foes beheaded
This music, is mind control like computer chips
Been doin this for numerous years, refuse to lose it
Wit turbo tactics, maneuver like a trained soldier
Hall of Fame flame thrower, take game, it's game over
Ayatollah, high roller nine totter
Mind controller, 2009 time folder

Wu-blade decision, slate the competition, wit no intermission
Spittin hazardous darts, up front like Rosa Parks
Makin million men march

I chin check, all these MC's line em up god, I go Jihad
Declare holy war, it be hard to dip and dodge
Police squads tryin to bogart, we rip and rob
The boulevard ain't safe for your kids, that's how it is
In the ghetto, we ain't scared to death, but scared to live
So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy
Rusty-ass .38 Special, niggas owe me
Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch
36 Chambers, Enter at your own risk
Take that watch off and tuck your necklace

Rap style'll slave you, when you least expect it
Pull the plug on your respirator, leave you breathless

52,Dance Hall Crashers,Setting Sun,TRFPAZD128F4234020,1999,"There was a boy and he thought himself quite special
Somehow important and confidently able
He didn't care if your face got under his foot
As long as he didn't stop to have to look

He had a chest for the trophies that he'd stolen
He shined them every morning on his way in
And even he really started to believe it
Rationalizing that they were meant for him

But I know that you're not the king of the setting sun
I know what you are and have done
And that crown you found is gonna leave on your head a big green ring
You're not the king of the setting sun
I know what you have not done
And you're gonna burn in hell

He sometimes wondered if he was just trash
He felt guilty one day, but it passed
And after that he convinced even himself
That everyone loved him and no one else

But I know that you're not the king of the setting sun
I know what you are and have done
And that crown you found is gonna leave on your head a big green ring
You're not the king of the setting sun
I know what you have not done
And you're gonna burn in hell

Thinking back, you smiled at how you'd come this far
And how the idiots had bought into what you told them you are
Now hold really still and hope that they don't see
That you're one big vacancy

But I know that you're not the king of the setting sun
I know what you are and have done
And that crown you found is gonna leave on your head a big green ring

64,Tiles,Ambition (bonustrack),TRWEUNG12903CF9B51,1999,"It takes us far
It can make us what we are
A nagging voice
Or conscious choice
Driving you to excel

It's what we heed
Responding to personal need
Through clouds of doubt
Things we can't figure out
Incentive as a new day arrives

It’s not always there
Sometimes hidden
It’s not always fair
Sometimes forbidden
Press on with resolution
The challenge won - ambition"

That flows in time, the maze of life is so difficult
I doubt what the children to run and fight
Respecter's in the eyes of the beholder who sees that
Fun that will come when the sun shines
Together living in unity there's no need to fight
The rough society,
I know the time will be here
Again when the chances are thin
And you know it will lead to the end

I hope the day will come sometimes when
I know the stories to be told
We'll tell the stories to the young and old
Both children who grow together in school
Oh now I wish the time we will come that the dreams
That I dream will last for a long time.

Pull me up - pull me up
Pull me up - pull me up
Pull me up - pull me up

Oh I feel so magical, that I feel the temptation running
Through my veins. Well if together in happiness and
I know the time, the time will come to this
As long as there holding on
Holding
Holding
Holding
Holding

Well imagine yourself in a large open space
No communication and no one to raise for you to be in this predicament in
Time.
We'll leave our imaginations
Open wide so before the floods
The storms may raise
There should be a bride today
Well on that day we shall live together as one, happily under the sun

Auf einem Dachfirst balanciern

Und wir zählten bis zehn
Es würde uns trotzdem nichts passiern

Dass wir heut Nacht unsterblich sind
Egal was uns jetzt noch geschieht
Ich weiß, dass wir unsterblich sind

Wir haben uns gegenseitig leicht gemacht
Sitzen auf 'ner Wolke
Und stürzen nie ab
Hier geht's uns gut, denn wir sind auf der Flucht
Bis die Sonne uns am Morgen wieder zurückholt

A ver o lado claro de um dia mau

Marcada  pela dor de não saber aonde dói

O travo amargo da melancolia

Então porque a raiva se a culpa não é minha
Serão efeitos secundários da poesia

Mas para quê gastar o meu tempo
A ver se aperto a tua mão

Já que os teus pés não descolam do chão
Dizes que eu dou só por gostar
Pois vou dar-te a provar

Can't really say
Why I hold you then I push you away
As I'm watching the face of eternity changing
I'm making my way to you

When everything seemed new
No point in changing or rearranging
Anything I do
But now I'm spinning out in all directions at once

Help me please
I'm sinking down to my knees
And I've tried everything
But you're so hard to please

So many magic hours
Hanging out with nothing to do
But now I'm spinning out in all directions at once

Down the river wide
All my friends on the other side
And I'm trying to call out

But I can't find the words

Blacken their patterns
A pock in the healthy and calm

Their scorn behind your back
My promise would put them down
No trace of reverence left
Immemorial fire in their eyes

I would perish at the given signal
At the slightest touch from my soul
Tainted prophet in flesh
For all the plagued and lost

Dripping sin, desicion in stalemate
Dare to feel death at hand
Surprised me with its voice
Through the forest came the morn

Across the leafy pathway
Their deeds smeared in blood
For all to behold
The council of the cross

Must have sensed my coming
The pest through the air
With despise for squalor
Lashing out at the poor

I turned away my eyes
In pallor escape from the end
Fading time to leave from here
And less to fulfill my task

Taken away from stifling grace
And saved from the past"

And whispers the words with a smile

Waiting for the phone to ring

Save them for a rainy day, yea, yea, yea
An IOU could break her heart in two
She thought you were the real McCoy, Sonny Boy

To answer the phone when you call
Sorry, Sonny's underneath the weather
Try him back later next fall

The boss called him out to California
Let Hollywood make you a star
Now he's on the Music Television
And driving a Cadillac car

Funny how fame and money does what it can
To bring about change in the boy
The clothes don't make the man

Though it never will be the same again

Take him for anything, but don't take him for a fool

you said it was dangerous
found out the place where you're going
follow me down the path
I take your hopes I promise you this
a dying cold world but gold
shimmering gold

come momma now tell me the story
only laughing
about our gilded wasteland
devoured torn into pieces
come now we shine

you hear some other time unchained alive
a world undefined

Dr Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde, remind me, remind me

In a bedroom of a brick &amp; stuck house
A girl in Seersucker pants reached for a book
To pass the day away

Not yet knowing the proper way to read
The girl took the tales as fact and cried all afternoon

After dinner and after her daily bath
Clean-skinned and dump-haired she lay down to bed
As the lights went out

Under an Amish quilt and inside her flannel pajamas
The girl wrestled with troubled thoughts
Troubled sleep, troubled dreams

The elevator opens on
A while frost-bitten world
I step out and the doors slide closed
Leaving me alone
With the only one who could hurt me

Jackals hide behind handsome faces
Dr Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde, remind me, remind me

Old Giapetto sold all his winter clothes
To buy books for his wooden son
Who lied, lied through his nose
And when the circus wagon came rollin' through the town
The boy jumped aboard and left
Not even a note

In desperation over this disappearance
The old man with arthritic hands tore down his house
Plank by plank
And carried each one by one, down to the harbour
Trading his shoes for some nails and a hammer to build
To build himself a boat

The waters are wide
But I will find my child
I'll set out into the sun
Until I met my end
In the belly of a whale

Jackals hide behind handsome faces
Dr Jekyll &amp; Mr Hyde, remind me, remind me

Nineteen eithy two, Mercedes Blues and the rumbling sputter
Of a diesel engine and the gooseflesh returns
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
We can't see ourselves inside this moving sedans
The windshield's too busy to reflect 
The outside looks lovely and oh so tempting
The light on the smokestacks and water towers beckons me
Beckons to me
So hello, my newfound friend Disaster
Come sit down at our round-table
Let us ask your advices
Should we bring on the accident ?

Drive on my friends
There's love beyond this bend
Sky's falling doctor's calling
But still it's worth the wait
Time's passed
Time is passing
And time will pass

85,The Badlees,A Little Faith,TRZMUXB128F92F6CB6,1999,"Martha's wearing blue jeans
And she's praying for the poor
Two midgets shop for Halloween
At a Salvation Army store
And a widow with a quarter
Buys herself a plastic ring
A little faith is a precious thing

Santa in December
The circus in July
The fat man he has mouths to feed
Just like you and I
And a family of agnostics
Attends a christening
A little faith is a precious thing

Tonight meet me at the graveyard
Up on Teaberry Hill
We'll lie upon the ground and dream
Where truth and superstition
Are just a reasoning away
And nothing is ever as it seems

Like a seed that grows
'Neath fallen leaves 
She wouldn't let them keep her down
Left her parents’ home
Moved to the country
Now her children play in the backyard
Near where the cooling towers steam
A little known faith
A little known faith
A little known faith is a precious thing

Construction got rained out today now baby
No one will know you’re missing until four
Get your children off to school
Meet me by the in-ground pool 
And wear that leather dress I like so well
To the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel

Shower always full of lead now baby
But there’s a telephone and two twin beds for 37 bucks so
Wash your hair beneath the eaves
I’ll push the beds together
Now let’s have ourselves a little R&amp;R as well
At the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway…

[Instrumental Bridge]

Carpet fresh and diesel fumes now baby
Mixed quite nice with your perfume now baby
And a couple staying next to here
Seems to have the same idea
I guess that everybody has a service they can sell
In the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel

Close the door sir and the key
Back at home by 3:15
Well I know that classic story not to tell
From the Midway Motel

We'll ride our boards down the hill
And to the playground
Where everything's okay.
Tell your mom that we'll be home late,
Cuz building cabins in the woods is hard work

You always know that I'll be there
Cuz summer time is coming near
My closest friend you'll always be
You are a home town kid like me..

Tell your mom to make us lunch now
Cuz we worked up an appetite
G.I. Joes and Karate matches in the backyard
Where everything's all right
Now I can see that things have changed
We've gone our separate ways now
And it's not you and me anymore..

Why can't it be the way it was
Where pain was only plastic guns

You are a million miles away

I wonder if you're calling me

I know I acted
Cold when you said goodbye.
I didn't know how
I could say
goodbye to you

And a scrape in the hole
Digging up a bruise that darkens,
Calibrated to go

Down down down,
And your grip is slipping
Down down down,
And the page is ripping

Wasting the world away
At the bite of your touch
The wash of the passing days seeping out
Doesn't matter that much
Drowning out... no sound, pouring out upon the ground
Raining down... the drain

Down down down,
Morning shakes and you're fadin' away
Down, down, slowly down,
Metal stress and it's shearing away

Round and around and around to the ground,
And I'm stumbling, tripping
Down... jerk around
And the record's skipping...
Skipping, skipping, skipping
And the record's skipping"

Possible is probably wrong.
So, let go

Keep my hands by my side.

You won't come back
I hope some day you'll understand
I wanna try, make it right
Don't know if I can.

Last night everything was right
The rain was gone.
One summer night's the only time we've known.
So, shut your eyes
When you wake up I'll be gone.
When you wake up I'll be gone.

Stripped of my clearance - fired 
I don't know what to do 
Haunted by empty faces 
Victims of warring madness 
If they only knew 

Their world's a bloody mess 
Some corporate bottom line 
I tried to ask and they treat me like a threat 
And they slammed the door behind 

Yesterday I walked away into a cold cold city 
So afraid our world today is just a house of lies 
Just believe in what you feel 
They used to say they used to say 
Then out of nowhere 
I melt into my busy day 

Reaching out in my world 
Becomes a matter of 
Connections to the net 
I've locked myself in real good 
Investigative research 
Looking for what is real 

Welcome to the brave new world 
No light inside my soul 
The more I learn the deeper in I'm drawn 
The deeper in I fall 

Yesterday I walked away into a cold cold city 
Ain't it strange how wars get raged to sounds of smashing dreams 
Just believe in what you feel 
They used to say they used to say 
Then out of nowhere 
One world 
No Chance 
Is this the new human race? 
A faceless contact with life 
Imaginary places stealing all of my time 
Is this a test of my faith? 
What's to become of my life 
I used to see it so clear 
But now I've lived to see it pass away 
Before my eyes"

But know one heard them 
And I just passed them and 
I screamed ""Lady get a job!"" 
She took her own life 
Under the bridge that day 
While her children sat and cried 
I could have told her about my loving father 
Instead I spit in Jesus face, when I heard her voice

Then the awkward retreat
To his lonely stockade
To his imaginary maid
She's sweeping down the plain
She's under his reign

Like a rough wind howling through Oklahoma
It's a cold wind down in Oklahoma

He's been hurt once - and he's hurt one twice
And all the pain is still labeled ""inside""
He's sorting it out inside

But now his voice no longer speaks
When the truth begins to leak
To the heavily love-laden mercenary maiden
But deep within their spark
His hidden orders bark

To listen what my true love did say

""Oh who is that at my bower window?
That raps so loudly and would be in?""
""It is your true love that loves you dearly
So rise, dear love, and let him in""

And slowly, slowly came she down

Her true love had both come and gone

If I wasn't already in the middle
The crowd was confused - and then they cheered
My career it was back on track
I was relieved, full of love for the people
I said ""Thank you, each and every one of you,
For loving me at my worst"" 

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me? 

All you bright and middle-aged things
Attending your sons and daughters
Spare a thought for me out here with the kids
To hell with your bricks and mortar 

It's you and me and the Holy Ghost
On the road to dawn heading down the coast
We're better sorry than safe when you count the cost
Mmm sorry than safe when you count the cost 

There's a bar out east called Scrum
Only red wine and the finest of cigars
And if we leave now we'll still get in
You can find yourself a young consort
Writers of unpopular fiction are trying to drink more
Than bikies who've all left their beards at the door
You'll drink all the wine and smoke your cigar
And say ""Thank you, thank you, for loving me at my worst"" 

If this isn't love it's very close
Can you hear the world is waking up?
Can we be crazy for a few more years?
Have I got them in me?"

At the top of the social ladder I speak 
Let me welcome you here officially 
To the back drop of martini clatter 
Break the ice with superficial chatter 
I'm glad to be this year's MC 
To greet the chic and the elite 
Yeah, you finally get to mix and mingle 
Pressing flesh until your fingers tingle 

Worldwide socialites unite 
OK, alright 

Verse:2

The band is grander than I recall 
The talk is cultured, if a little small 
Keep parading your charading manners 
Keep pretending that it really matters 
Don't ask, don't tell 
And please don't stare at the emperor 
In his underwear 
Special thanks to the snack committee 
Heavens, don't those tarts look pretty 

Chorus: 1

Worldwide socialites unite 
Enjoy the conversation 
But try to keep it light 
Just avoid the friction 
And if you feel conviction 
Well then, baby, step outside 
Let's keep the ""lite"" in social 
Let's keep the social light 
Let's keep the ""lite"" in socialite

Avoid the dreaded question 
The meaning of our lives 
And as to God's existence

And, quite frankly, impolite

Ich glaub's nicht, der absolute Wahnsinn, Dich zu treffen,
Freut mich unwahrscheinlich, ich hab Deinen Namen vergessen naja,
wir haben uns ja auch schon Jahre nicht gesehen
Klar! Setz Dich her, ich wollte eh gerade gehen
Wie's mir so geht? - Naja ganz gut, und selbst, was geht ab?
Wirklich, Du studierst, das hätt' ich bei Dir nie gedacht.
Dann nehmen die mittlerweile jeden, hast'n coolen Studiengang?
Ach, Soziologie, das klingt auch durchaus interessant.
Und Dein Baby noch die gleiche wie in der Neunten?
Ihr wart 'das perfekte Paar', hattet beide keine anderen Freunde
Sie hat Dich abserviert? Verzweifel nicht
Jetzt gibt es keinen mehr , der anruft,
hast mal richtig Zeit für Dich
Und unter Einsamkeit wirst Du doch sowieso nicht lange leiden
Für Typen wie Dich gibt's ja Kontaktanzeigen - naja
ich muss dann weiter, wünsch' Dir noch 'n schönes Leben
Freut mich, dass Dir gut geht, und war nett mit Dir zu reden.

Chorus:

Ich würd gern ewig mit Dir reden
doch ich muss jetzt leider gehen,
muss Morgen füh raus, und es ist schon drei vor Zehn
Aber kein Problem
Wir holen's nach, ich ruf Dich an.
Ja klar hab' ich die Nummer noch
'Glaub' mir das, wenn ich's Dir sag'

Ey Wahnsinn Dich zu treffen,
haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Siehst ja noch gar nicht so alt aus, wie die Leute sich erzählen
Am liebsten würd' ich zurückrennen und es denen an der Kasse sagen
wie super ich's find, dass sie Dich hier reingelassen haben
Bist' allein hier? Hast die Alte wohl endlich in'n Wind geschossen?
Nein! Ihr kommt grade aus den Flitterwochen
Hab' gehört, Du machst Karriere. Bist seit Wochen den Job los.
Wer für Geld alles macht, kriegt immer was, also Kopf hoch!
Lass Dich mal anschauen - hast Dich wirklich soitze gehalten.
Die Frisur, die Jacke und selbst die Witze sind die alten
Und der Pulli ist der schönste, den Dir Omi je gestrickt hat
Wie gibt's das, dass dein Smiley-Button immer noch so glitzert?
Ja, ich weiss, dass die 8T's wieder modern sind
und wo würden wir denn hinkommen, wenn sich auf einmal jeder ernst nimmt?
Komm' setz Dich! Laß uns reden, sage nicht nein,
Ach was anschreiben lassen, Alter, ich lade Dich ein
""Herr Ober, kann ich nochmal zwei Bacardi-Cola haben?
Was, Du n Monat bei den anonymen Alkoholoikern,
also Ober, Bacardi-Cola und ne Capri-Sonne mit Strohhalm

110,Dr. Dre,The Watcher,TRTSQPB128E078EC42,1999,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming OGs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags, when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show

Eminem and Knock-Turn'Al:
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch)

Dr. Dre:
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither, it's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fucking with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes

Eminem and Knock-Turn'Al:

Dr. Dre:
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed outand pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
Lookin' at us, now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just having fun just watching it fly by

Dans mes refus de dire je t'aime
Plus d'amour que dans les poèmes
Et que dans tous ces mots-là...

Si tu vois,
Flotter une larme bohème
Dans les yeux, mon cur s'y promène
C'est qu'alors je pense à toi

C'est comme ça,
Le bonheur n'est pas géomètre
J'ai pas de plans à te soumettre,
Je sais pas le faire marcher droit

M'en veux pas
Si je ne peux rien te promettre
C'est que je voudrais tout peut-être
Et ça ne me suffirait pas

Pas à pas
Je parle à tâtons et j'effleure
Tous ces mots qui reprennent couleur
Quand je les pose sur toi

Et je vois
Les rêves qui hésitent encore
Prendre la forme de ton corps
Et je souris malgré moi

Jusque-là
J'croyais à peu près me connaître
J'ai tout jeté par ta fenêtre
Pour mieux m'apprendre dans tes bras

M'en veux pas
Si je ne sais rien te promettre
À part dans ces phrases muettes
Que je vagabonde sur toi

Laisse-moi le temps de t'aimer sans penser au-delà
Tu me souris et tu te tais, mais tu ne comprends pas...
Laisse-moi, le temps de trouver l'empreinte pour mes pas
À force de t'avoir cherchée, j'ai un peu peur de moi

Peur de moi...
Est-ce que ce n'est pas autre chose
Tu m'apprivoises et je dépose
Mes ombres fanées derrière moi

Peur de quoi
Peur de l'avenir qui se glisse
Entre ma peau et mes caprices
Quand je me perds au bord de toi

Peur de quoi
Tout simplement de reconnaître
Que tout est là, dans ces peut-être
Qui me chavirent autour de toi

Peur de moi...
Il n'y a rien d'autre à comprendre
Toi tu voulais des mots plus tendres,
Et moi... Je te parle de moi

Were at the best place around
When some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat

The greatest thief in the high Sahara
Enters the room where a sleeping princess lies

This is my work on such a night
There's a storm coming over the mountain
I'll be gone long before the morning

After the rain has fallen
After the tears have washed your eyes
You find that I've take nothing, that
Love can't replace in the blink of an eye

He was as gentle as the night wind
As no lover had been before
And the rings she wore for her bridegroom
Slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor

Take me with you, take me with you
Before my lonely life is set
I've been promised to another
To a man I've never even met

After the rain has fallen

After the lightning bolt's been hurled
After the dream is broken, there'll

Take me for a pirate's wife
Take me where the wind blows
Take me where the red wine flows
Take me to the danger
Take me to the life of crime
Take me to the stars
Take me to the moon while we still have time
