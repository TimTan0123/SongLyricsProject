0,Ola Magnell,Tomma tunnor,TRBLGUF128E078B1BF,1981,"Jag reser mej och går ut ur maskernas ruin
Och vädrar ut min smak för ljuva livet
Jag tiger mej en ton i mödosam sordin
Jag lever men har tappat perspektivet

Jag slits mellan den jag är
Och vad dom har mej till
Du ser nog att jag rör min mun
Men aldrig vad jag vill
Vad jag vill vet jag bäst
Men i en värld där
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest

Jag är ställd av komplimanger och vacklar av kritik
Jag kånkar kring förgiftad last på vägen
Där alla tomma löften bakom nickedocksmimik
Gör mej så förstämd och så förlägen

Den som inte har ett mål
Kommer kanske ingenstans
Utan mål i munnen
Har man ändå ingen chans
Den som bullrar lyckas bäst
I en värld där
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest

På vägen ser jag mänskor utan pansar men som kan
Ta sej fram med enkla medel, kan det tyckas
Och jag begrundar orden ""varken kvinna eller man
Blir förtryckt som inte låter sej förtryckas""

Förmyndare försmår oss
Om och om igen
""Ve det folk som inte
Tuktar sina styresmän""
Dom är störst men inte flest
Men kom ihåg att
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest

Jag drar mej in i skuggan av en vajande markis
Och dricker klokskap under björkens hängen
Men när jag hör min stämma har den blivit alltför vis
""Ljus som tänds av andra brinner aldrig länge""

Lånta fjädrar ger dej guld
Men ingen sagoskatt
Jag släpper ut maximerna
Som fyller upp min hatt
En fåfäng liten gest
I en tid när
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest

Jag vill reparera boningen och bygga mej en borg
Runt förståndet och kring tårarna på kinden
Jag vill tänka tanken klar, jag vill unna mej min sorg
Och lyssna till mitt vemod under linden

Och vi behöver inte
Följas åt i vått och torrt
Men ""den väg du går allena
Leder bara bort""
Mot bitterhet och pest
I en värld där
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest

Och jag styr mot öppet vatten och vilar mej en vy
Och gråter ut för vågorna mot stranden
I skuggan av den gallergrind som tvingar mej att fly
Och bygga slott av galenguld i sanden

Men vart vi än må fly
Och var vi än gör halt
Ska vi finna samma
Gallergrindar överallt
Ett arvegods, en rest
Vad gör det att
Tomma tunnor skramlar mest"
1,Alain Chamfort,Baby boum,TRTNNDZ12903CC6F16,1981,"Boum, Boum, Baby Boum

 Veux-tu Baby boom
 Et dis-moi ce que tu vois
 Hors de tes boums

 Toi qui ne pense qu'à ça
 Sais-tu Baby Boum
 Que dans la vie y a pas que la
 Danse et les boums

 Le rock est un hors-la-loi
 Il tue Baby Boum
 Le temps, mais le vrai n'est pas
 Que dans les surboums

 Vois-tu Baby Boum

 Alors là, Boum !"

3,Alex Chilton,Take me home and make me like it,TRABWLQ128F92E1CDA,1981,"Cut my guts, stand me in an alley
Call me a slut in front of your family
Bite my veins, cigarettes and big eyes
Black leather thoughts only whip like words

Just take me home (just take me home) and make me like it
Walk me along and help, help me spike it

Walk me on the deadline, let the cats rip me up
Three lives to live and two I'll do to drop
Black leather thoughts only whip like words
(I'M ON THE LEDGE!) Blondie, you're a dredge

Take me home (just take me home) and make me like it
Walk me along and help, help me spike it

(INSTRUMENTAL)

Cut my guts, stand me in an alley
Call me a slut in front, in front of your family

Take me home (just take me home) and make me like it
Walk me along and help, help me spike it

4,Joe Ely,Musta Notta Gotta Lotta,TROVEKZ128F1459D06,1981,"Please understand me everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

I was high flyin' down Riverside Drive
Rockin' to the radio man alive
Stopped into a joint bought a round of booze
Hot dog I got a buzz in my shoe!

Please understand me everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Writin' you a letter it's late in the night
Sittin' in a cafe eatin' a bite
Telln' you about where all I've been
Hot dog I'm gone again!

Please understand me everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Now there's two kind of people in this big 'ol town
There's the early to rise and the late to go down
I guess I oughta find a better way to stop the clock
Hot dog I like it a lot!

Please understand me everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep last night

Hot dog I like it a lot!

Please understand me everything's all right
I just musta notta gotta lotta sleep! last! night!"
5,The Rolling Stones,Start Me Up,TRBFMTO128F9322AE7,1981,"If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop

I've been running hot
You got me ticking gonna blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk in smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start it up
Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy
She's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start me up
Give it all you got
You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up
Slide it up
Slide it up (never, never, never)

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

Start it up
Love the day when we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come
You, you make a dead man come"
6,Elton John,Breaking Down Barriers,TRTHPDR128EF35F742,1981,"I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out

I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine

I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You gotta go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You gotta give if you wanna get
And I want all you got"
7,Boney M.,Sad Movies,TRVAAVI128F4292D90,1981,"Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry

He said he had to work, so I went to the show alone.
They turned down the lights and turned the projector on.
And just as the news of the world started to begin,
I saw my darling and my best friend walking in.

So I was sitting where they didn't see
And so they sat right down infront of me
And when he kissed her lips I almost died
and in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cry

Oh Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry

And so I got on up and slowly I walked on home,
And Mama saw the tears and said ""Baby what is wrong"".
And so just to keep from telling her a lie,
I just said ""Sad movies makes me cry"".

Oh Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry
Sad movies always make me cry"
8,Herman Brood & His Wild Romance,Jivin' (Myself),TROIZUD128F933A7DD,1981,"I'm sick of the city
sick of the heat
sick of 'm dopey nitwits
at the shootin' galery
sick from pickin' up the craps
from half the chicks that I touch

Social diseases &amp; ratty lil' habits
closin' me in
drivin' me nuts

Always thought I had complete control &amp;
one day you wake up honey
down in the hole

I've been jivin' myself too long
I've been jivin' myself too long

Wake up too far gone to do y'r
lousy routine
like rip off some fag
down at the pissin' machine

You know the past is a wound in the head
lookin' back is a pain in the neck
been jivin' myself too long
with phone extacy
lust for life


straight from the pharmacy

I've been jivin' myself too long
I've been jivin' myself too long

There's a thing called love
but I can't seem to find it
don't see them in the street
don't see it in the poolhall at the disco
don't see it at places
where people should meet

There must be more good in life
than I can see
gotta find I way to make it part of me
lord have mercy
just some private lil' fantasy
now back to reality, look out
see that bum pull a gun
for a hand full of chickenfeed
right in the middle of
weekend shoppin' mainstreet
beat a bum for 25 cents
surrounded by tourists
&amp; uniformed misfits

I've been jivin' myself too long"
9,Foreigner,Girl On The Moon,TRBGSAY128F92F3F28,1981,"It's night again
Time for my mind to go wandering
Off on a journey through space and time
In search of a face I can never find
So I close my eyes and look inside

I can't forget
The night that I saw her, we never met
She felt so close to me as I reached for her hand
She drifted away like the desert sand
It was her and she was gone

I wish she'd come back tonight
Like a star shining bright
I don't know where she's from

She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon
She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon

Yeah, it's night once again
And that same old feeling is setting in
It all seems so familiar but I hope this time
That the girl on the moon will soon be mine
All mine tonight

Am I asking too much?
Should I leave my dream untouched?
Should I even know where she's from?

My girl on the moon
She's my girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
My girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
My girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Girl on the moon
Fille sur la lune
Girl on the moon
Fille sur la lune"

When I was a boy I thought that someday I would be a man
I'd sit inside the fireplace, pretend that I was in a can
Go inside my room and put my mind in an ice cream cone
And you can throw me if you want, but I'm a ball and I go
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah!	
Yeah!

Oh, yeah yeah!

Now if I don't stop crying, it ain't cos that I have got no eyes
My clock lies in the fireplace, my dog lies hypnotised
And then there was the time I wasn't able to find my way
And I'm trapped inside a night without a day and I go	
Oom pah pah, oom pah pah!
Yeah!

Now, when I was a boy I thought that someday I would be a man

12,Emmylou Harris,Millworker,TRGIAEG128F92EDBF5,1981,"(James Taylor)

Now my grandfather was a sailor,
He blew in off the water
My father was a farmer
I, his only daughter,
Took up with a no-good millworking man from Massachusetts
Who dies from too much whiskey
And leaves me these three faces to feed.

Millwork ain't easy; mill-work ain't hard
Millwork, it ain't nothing but an awful boring job
I'm waiting for a day dream
To take me through the morning
And put me in my coffee break
Where I can have a sandwich and remember.

Then it's me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life.

Now my mind begins to wander
To the days back on the farm
I can see my father smiling at me,
Swingin' on his arm
I can hear my grand-dad's stories
Of the storms out on Lake Erie
Where vessels and cargos and fortunes
And sailor's lives were lost.

Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,
And I have been the fool
To let this manufacture use my body for a tool.
I can ride home in the evening,
Staring at my hands
Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl
Ought to stand a better chance.

So may I work the mills
Just as long as I am able
And never meet the man whose
Name is on the label.

It be me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life..."
13,Saxon,Out Of Control,TRXDXFG128F92DA173,1981,"Breaks away the chains that bind me
Gives me sympathy
Keeps me running on the high road
Keeps me living free
Never tries to steal my thunder
Helps me through the night
Always there to help and guide me
Makes me feel alright

There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her
Moves my very soul
When we touch I lose control
I'm outta control
I lose control
I'm outta control

When I feel depressed and lonely
She never asks me why
Always knows just when to leave me
When I start to lie
Tries to think about the next day
So I can survive
When I come home tired and weary
She keeps me satisfied

There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her
Moves my very soul
When we touch I lose control

She breaks away the chains that bind me
Gives me sympathy
Keeps me running on the high road
Keeps me living free
Never tries to steal my thunder
Helps me through the night
Always there to help and guide me
Makes me feel alright

There ain't no doubt about it
Just can't live without her

When we touch I lose control

14,The Jam,Tales From The Riverbank,TRWWASQ128E07939E9,1981,"Bring you a tale from the pastel fields
Where we ran when we were young
This is a tale from the water meadows
Trying to spread some hope into your heart 

It's mixed with happiness, it's mixed with tears
Both life and death are carried in this stream
That open space you could run for miles
Now you don't get so many to the pound

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to
That I'll always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank

Paradise found down by the still waters
Joined in the race to the rainbow's end
No fears, no worries, just a golden country
Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset

Now life is so critical
Life is too cynical
We lose our innocence
We lose our very soul

True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to
That I'll always run to
True, it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to
That I always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank
Come on and join me by the riverbank"

And I cry for you, I can't get over you, oh
On and on, the feeling's twice as strong
And I can't get used to being without you

Who said that lie? Well, it doesn't matter why
I guess we'll never figure where we went wrong
I try to write it off but I can't forget the lost
The feeling so strong but still it goes on and on and

On and on, the love goes on and on
And I cry for you, I can't get over you
On and on, the feeling's twice as strong
And I can't get used to being without you

I just heard a song playing on the radio
It reminds me of the way we used to go
A slice of paradise and there was heaven in my life
We try to face it away but still it goes on and on and

On and on, the love goes on and on
And I cry for you, I can't get over you
On and on, the feeling's twice as strong

You must know I am right 

Come and join the fun on the way to heaven
Come and talk to god on the party line
If you can't be bothered, we don't need you
We're going to live for a very long time 

He'll give you one more chance
Now's the time to take it
He's waiting for your call
You'll be up there with me
We'll be grinning in heaven
When the day of judgment comes 

Come and join the fun on the way to heaven
Come and talk to god on the party line
If you can't be bothered, we don't need you

17,Chris Rea,Guitar Street,TRVUKGJ128F14563CF,1981,"There's a crazy sense of duty
As he licks between his fingers
Wipes the ketchup from his face and hands
There's a strong determination
That his teachers never witnessed
Never close enough to understand
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing
Outside the only thing that he knows

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy
But take a look 'cos there he goes

Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams
All the way down Guitar Street

To some guitars are hot-rods
All along the quest for macho
To others a would-be ticket out of town
For Joe a six-string sten gun
In the 'Panto-revolution'
And Stevie's all just strictly sound
He's like a bull just bred for fighting
He don't deliver nothing
Outside the only thing that he knows

School report just says he's lazy
His brother says he's crazy
But anyway take a look 'cos there he goes
Through the avenues of fashion
To the palaces of dreams
All the way down Guitar Street"

Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up, to it, 
Don't drive, through it
Back it, up twice

Operate around the clock,
Slow it if you come in?
I've got lots of space for everyone
One for you my friend?
My lines are short I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on,
Shiny sleek machine you wheeled
I've got to blow your horn.

Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limosine,

So much gun shot some
cripple some turn fool
They are responsible for a lot
of children
And they need food
And they want to go to school

I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
pistol pistol
A very thin line to start the crime
Who will be the first to
volunteer
You love you love your fuckery
Get up and get yourself together
You hear the words of Jah Jah
coming from the hill top of
Dabra Dabra
Keep you strength

The youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
I say the youth of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith
and Wesson pistol pistol

Stop and listen
They want you to fight the good fight
But save you strength
For strength of life
The youths in Africa
All a dem a thriller

I say the youth of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youth of Kingston
Won't leave their Magnum
pistol pistol
Poor Jill she was a spill
she got hit by a stray shot

The youths of Eglington
Won't put down their Remington
The youths of Brixton
They put down their 45 Smith
and Wesson pistol pistol"
23,Blue Oyster Cult,Sole Survivor,TRUVCNQ128F4267B6D,1981,"There walked a lonely man
Silent, mute, the only man
Not knowing how, not knowing why
Was he the sole survivor
Why should he be alive,
Breathing still while others died?
And the only question:
Why was he the sole survivor?

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Wind blew across the sand
He stood alone, he had no plan
And with the last rays of the sun
He screamed aloud, began to run
In his tears he sees his face
""I am the end of the human race
""When I'm gone there'll be no trace
""For I'm the sole survivor""

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

One night when years had passed
The sky shook from a fiery blast
And there a starship, saved at last
To come rescue this survivor
They beckoned him inside
But only man, he would not ride
Instead he found a place to hide
For he's the sole survivor

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted savior, cried into the night"

Still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow 
The time to strike is now

Kill! Kill!

Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

Gone are the days when freedom shone 
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand 
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge, into glory ride
Over the top of their vanquished pride

Victory! Victory!
Victory! Victory! 

Victory! Victory! 
Victory! Victory! 

To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind

Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time
We'll catch the wind

Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!

As tender as the gentle dawn

And on that sweet and velvet night

16 is where we'll go.

Burning with your eyes; 
Steal a way of life.
Waste my endless time; 
Steal a way of life.

Moving to another town,
While the week were standing still
Life pulsating all around
Where there's fear there's a will."
51,Stiff Little Fingers,Silver Lining,TRVAJLY128EF34B69A,1981,"They tell you not to worry, they say they're terribly sorry
But that's the way it has to be, for the likes of you and me
Just be good and know your station
Always look on the bright side
Keep you faith and keep your patience
Your reward is after you've died

(Chorus:)
So don't be told, don't be consoled
Things are so bad, you can never make do
And there's always someone better off than you

They tell you that's your future, it's all down to human nature
Simply settle for what you got, that's destiny and that's your lot
All of us cannot come first, yes what you have is second best
But it might be a good deal worse
Third world peasants get even less

(Chorus)

Do you care that it's not fair?
Is this the way we have to live? 
I know I care, and I want an equal share
Even if it mean I have to give

The people who are on top
Say that you should keep your chin up and
They are keen to show you, the unhappy ones below you
But I want to more of that stuff, that's looking at it upside down
And the world has got money enough for us to make it go around so

Don't be told, don't be consoled
Don't be ruled and don't be fooled
Because things are so bad you can never make do
And there's always someone better off than you"
52,Styx,The Best Of Times,TRLOCIC128F14AEC53,1981,"Tonight's the night we'll make history, honey, you and I
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here tonight
I know you feel these are the worst of times
I do believe it's true
When people lock their doors and hide inside
Rumor has it it's the end of Paradise
But I know, if the world just passed us by
Baby I know, I wouldn't have to cry

The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find these are the best of times
These are the best of times

The headlines read 'these are the worst of times'
I do believe it's true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back Paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you'd always be around

The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find these are the best of times
These are the best of times

And 
So my friends we'll say goodnight For time has claimed its prize
But tonight will always last
As long as we keep alive memories of Paradise..."
53,Kenny Rogers,Long Arm Of The Law,TRUZWAA128F1456F65,1981,"In Cumberland Kentucky
On a cool hot evening
Billy lay in love with Marrianne
She was a rich judge's daughter
He was a son of a miner
But that night their love was more than they could stand
The judge said to his daughter
That son of that coal miner
Is someone you'll go hell to leave alone
She knew his dad so well
She knew she couldn't tell
But the truth was bound in show before too long

Their love had started growing on its own
You can't out run the long arm of the law
No, you can't out run the long arm of the law
Billy placed his hand on Mary
And he felt the baby's moving
Kissed her and said I'll see you when I can
The judge had made a promise
When he caught up with Billy
He'd sent him far away from Marianne
The whole town knew he'd do it
Too many times he'd proved it
To at least a hundred men behind the wall

He'd smiled behind that frown
And when he brought that gavel down
He called himself the long arm of the law
And he'd set his mind on seeing Billy fall
In a hot humid mine shack
A mid-white pulled the sheet back
And placed cool damp towel on Marianne
Billy's eyes were wide with wonder
From the spell he was under
When she placed the new born baby in his hands

He didn't hear the siren
Just a baby's crying
That miracle of love was all he saw

When the door came crashing down
And Billy turned around
He felt the heart and soul inside him fall
He stood face to face
With the long arm of the law
You can't out run the long arm of the law
No, you can't out run the long arm of the law
You can hide out for a while
He says with a smile
But you can't out run the long arm of the law

Seemed like everybody down in Cumberland Kentucky
Came out that day to see poor Billy's trial
The court was called to order
There sat the judge's daughter
She looked so proud
Holding Billy's child
When they brought Billy to him
The judge just look right thru him
As he held that Holy Bible in his hand
And he smiled at his grandson
Then his eyes cut back to Billy
And said I think this time
The law will understand
Son, I sentence you to live with Marianne

You can't out run the long arm of the law
No, you can't out run the long arm of the law
He said to Billy with a smile
I know you hide out for a while
Ah but you can't out run the long arm of the law
No you can't out run the long arm of the law"

56,Jim Steinman,Love And Death And An American Guitar,TRLJJKZ128F42788F1,1981,"I remember everything
I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday
I was barely 17 and I once killed a boy with a fender guitar
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
but I do remember that it had a heart of chrome
and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
but I do remember
that it wasn't at all easy
It required the perfect combination of the right powerchords
and the precise angle from which to strike
The guitar bled for about a week afterward and the blood was
ooh...
dark and rich like wild berries
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterward but it rung out beautifully,
and I was able to play notes that I had never even heard before.
So I took my guitar and I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against the body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981-Harley Davidson
The Harley howled in pain, the guitar howled in heat!
And I ran up the stairs to my parent's bedroom
Mommy and Daddy were sleeping in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door creeping in the shadows right up to the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
and just as I was about to bring the guitar crashing down upon the center of the bed
my father woke up screaming:
""Stop...wait a minute..stop it, boy
What do you think you're doing?
That's no way to treat an expensive musical instrument""
And I said ""God damn it, Daddy, you know I love you
But you got a hell of a lot to learn about rock and roll"""

I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you

Yeah someday I'll have a whole lot of money
I'll be a millionaire
But when that didn't happen overnight
I found out how much you really care
All you want is a whole lot of money
All the rest is just jiving honey

You've done nothing for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothing for me

I've done everything for you

And get as wild as I can be
I'm gonna find out what it's really like
To be lose, high and free

It's a pleasure machine

And you fly every night
But the dressing room mirror don't lie
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight

Leaving you on the stage
It's been so many years since that first matinee
It seems like an age

A guiding light brought your love to me, brought your love to me

A burning flame melted our 2 hearts into one
A burning desire could only take us higher, higher
Higher, higher. higher, higher, higher, higher
And what I want to know is where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
You tell me, Oh I'd like to know
Where Where Where

Lord I wonder would you mind if I just talked to you for a minute
You see, you see we been together too long baby for
Backin' up now
Let's go to Mars, where children play, and live on candy bars
Where spirit souls run free, there's no night or day
And all is harmony
That burning desire would always be a part of me
It brought us to this, and oh baby
This is our final destiny

A burning flame, it melted our 2 hearts into one ، oh no
A burning desire, all it could ever do is take us
Higher higher higher higher higher higher
And what I want to know is where do we go from here?
Ooh, where do we go from here?
I wonder can you tell me, and ooh I'd like know, baby

Break it on down, Let me, let me talk awhile
You See baby I'm sort of confused
You see I've been on the mountain top
And I knew, I knew one day my choice would come around
Excuse me while I take my time and sing this song

Where, ooh I'd like to know
Some times you build me up, sometimes you build me up
You build me up just to let me down, girl
I give you what you want, when you want it, where you وant it
Every dogonne time you feel that you need my love
You see I realize baby that, I need you, you need me
You see, God had a plan and that's the way our love was supposed to be
Now tell me where do we go from here

You see baby baby I'm just so tired
So tired of going through changes
I'm tired of your building me up just to let me down

He called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Whiting""
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what I read""
This is what it said:

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one

See you crawling on the floor
And diamond stars shine glitter bright
Gorging your sanhedralite
Words are falling to the floor
Glands stand pouring fruit tree
Now they glisten on the waterline
See how you are at the shore
I'm moving chrissie pretty flowers in the shutter maze
Haul up all your petty desires
Leave it lying down before
Wash away the rusty disease
Of your brown town days in our silver sea
Leave it dying at the door
Feather yell you've time to leave
Open out your arms and breathe

They blame me for the fires in town
Claim that hell is where i'm bound
And pray that God will speed me

I'll be his friend until the end

Always debates on nuclear war

Sometimes you wonder what to do
When you haven't got no cash
Better start thinking what you ll do
When your country turns to ash

You can blame the fucking Tories

Just in their financial gain
Then the bastards throw you out
And take your furniture away
Cause you can't afford the rent

Looking like something that the cat brought in

There has to be an invisible sun

By killing everybody in the human race

I've seen a fire start in 'Frisco
The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a-blazing
Throwing up in flames

I heard men, women and children crying out
To their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen
So they were burned alive

They went down, down, deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in Berlin
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers
March right across the Maginot Line

I've seen two world wars
I've seen men send rockets out into space
I foresee a holocaust
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race

Down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

In the sixteenth century
There was a French philosopher
By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesied
That in the late twentieth century
An angel of death shall waste this land
A holocaust
The likes of which this planet had never seen
Now, I ask you
Do you believe this to be true?

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, ""Have mercy, mercy""

His body was riddled with a disease
Unknown to man, so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

He went down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

You'll go down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

You'll go down, down...
Deep underground...

Could it be that we've arrived in fair Magentalane
There were times, many times
When I thought we wouldn't make it
I was quite prepared to take it like a man
But here I am

Aye aye bring our best champagne
We will drink a toast, you and I, to fair Magentalane
Now let me see well shouldn't I make a speech
Or say something in Greek
Perhaps recite a browning poem, but why
When the only thing that is on my mind is
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home

In Magentalane
Where the sea of pink champagne flows
Magentalane
Under rose colored bainrows
I mean rainbows

Yes there were times, several times
I was sure we had been defeated
As our Hopes became depleted through the years
But now we are here

So if you please it is time to take our leave
The road to liberty awaits us on the aerodrome incline
Gonna leave that bad old world behind
Because it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home"
96,Marvin Gaye,Love Party,TRUDYAE128F42A80E9,1981,"To me you're extra special mellow
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good
So when you say you love me, I really believe you, girl
For it's what you say and what you really do

Oh, you've got to understand, darling
The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
The world is not for long

Got to pray and meditate
(Got to pray and meditate)

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins
(Oh yeah)

To me you're really extra special mellow, baby
Oh, and the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
So when you say you love me, I believe you, baby
And it's good to party, fun to party with you, baby

To me you're extra special mellow, baby
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
Mmm, so when the party's over
Let's go create some loving, baby

Whoa, no time, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Fooling around, let there be peace and love
(Got to pray and meditate)

Oh baby, come here, come here, come here, darling
Oh, we need love
(Got to pray and meditate)
Love explosion, oh darling

Mmm, come here, come here, come here, baby

There was whores lying on the bed

There were some moving in colours bright

And left this violent blue.

It just left this violent blue.

The night the kid left Amsterdam
There was nobody who could understand why

Sweet sailor, steer through
Stay safe, runs true
Sweet sailor, steer clear
Nothing but trouble round here.

The last time that I saw him
He was looking fresh feeling fine
I’d have known if my boy was drowning
I’d have thrown that kid a line
You never find me looking  around the city no more like I did before
All that love lying wasted, just scattered across the floor.

99,Classix Nouveaux,Soldier,TRYDPZZ128F4274E6E,1981,"On all sides we're fighting all the time
And there is no escape
We all make it that way
Social grace hides jealousy and hate
Of what we may achieve
Or believe in or praise
Sometimes it makes me feel like
Dying, dying
'cause dead men don't care

Soldier, hey! soldier
You don't have to choose
To win or lose, it's the same
Soldier, hey! soldier
Everywhere i turn
No-one will learn
It's a game

Only strong men can survive for long
Against all odds it seems
And the schemes that we make
All men must return once more to dust
Then realise too late
All the hate was in vain
Sometimes it's hard to keep on
Fighting, fighting
And playing these games

Soldier... etc"

A moonlight sky and the stars are very bright

And he's seeing - things he has never - ever seen
He's in the real reality - he's blown his mind
And things, are being seen so differently in the real reality
-he's blown his mind

Warm hands in the fire - no burning touch
Can't wait to meet them - go upstairs - there's and evil air
The bed is moving, all around him - say your prayer"

Mes racines se défilent
Dans quelle île ou quel exil

J'ai posé des questions aux professeurs en blouse blanche
J'ai gagné des calmants à la place de réponses

Over the city, over tokyo
Silver light, summer moon
You'll be over somebody's winter this afternoon
While the dolphins swim in the sea
You're going grey, my baby
Still the war is waging endlessly
Day after day, day after day

Way up in the sky
Over the city and lake erie
You remember the flats, you were there
Out every night mr moonlight

Round and round and round we go
Just like yesterday

Way up in the sky
Over the city where you sleep tonight
The light outside your window blinks
Hotel, hotel, hotel
Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam

When the war's finally over
We'll meet again
And pick up where we left off"

Felt so good, went out and got me some more
Got me a quart about half past five

I do believe that would only break my heart
So if you feel like loving me
If you've got that notion
I second that emotion
So if you feel like giving me
A life-time of devotion
I second that emotion

I'm the dandy highwayman who you're too scared to mention

No bullet or a knife!

I'm the dandy highwayman so sick of easy fashion
The clumsy boots, peek-a-boo roots that people think so dashing
So what's the point of robbery when nothing is worth taking? (Ohoho)
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff the big mistake he's making

Stand and deliver

Try and use a mirror
No bullet or a knife!

And even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

We're the dandy highwaymen so tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies where only showbiz loses
We're the dandy highwaymen and here's our invitation (Ohoho)
Throw your safety overboard and join our insect nation

Leaving everything behind except my mind

She can burn your hands and sting your heart
She knows it's too late for you to save the world
And you believe that there's still time to start
And I'm walking out of the picture
Leaving everything behind except your mind
She's not just a pretty face
She's a big black hole as well
She swallows everything she sees
She's not of the human race
She's a creature out of hell
She's a disease

Saw away the taps and you're a brand new world

And the Brussles Museum
where we piled on the front steps
like stray cavaliers
our code of living
meant little to others
the few francs we saved 
bought some cheap souvienirs

But the red lights where the catfights
make it just like belgium
See us face down on the floor
of another cheap bathroom
streetwalkers sweet talk you out
of your spare change
and your sweet madame makes it seem
just like Belgium
Just like Blegium

just like a hustler
when they look attractive
it's nothing much more
than a slap on theback
The price tag of being
just a little bit different
The first rule to learn 
is to keep your own distance

but the red lights...."

From pocket money to a salary,  
From a pac-a-mac to a compact case  
And every morning she inspects her face.  
She discovers pulling pints in pubs  
That the good looks will never cover up for  
Her dumbness in taking the stock  
Sees her reflection in a butcher's shop.  
She finds it all quite rare  
That her meat's all vanity fair.   

She has her eyes on medallion men  
Who get her home on the dot at ten,  
She combs her hair when she gets excused  
The deal she wants always ends up screwed.  
Paints her nails on the bathroom scales  
Gargles her breath like a landed whale,  
Her beauty is as deep as her skin  
Keeps her eyebrows in a tobacco tin.  
She poses foot on the chair  
Coconut shy but vanity fair.   

In her vanity case her compact case  
In her compact case her eyes,  
Not bad for a sister  
But her vanity's fair and her sense of humour's dry.  
She comes home late with another screw loose  
She swears to have had just a pineapple juice,  
Falls asleep fully clothed in her bed  
With her makeup remover by her head.  
And she might not be all there  
But her dream's all vanity fair."

Spends all his days among the stars

Got a brand new house at the top of the hill

And every room's got a new TV
And every dog's got a pedigree

On the side walk Sunday morning
There's a body oozing life
Someone slipping round the corner
Is that someone Mack the Knife?

Johnny Whitey disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash

Did our boy do something rash, dear?

Used to hear the cars and the birds going by
And the people going by, they were my destiny
They were my reason, my purpose in this field
For their plates their cold bodies their car seat covers
My soul for your soles of shoes

Joka hehkui hänen silmistään.
Hän kohosi tanssiin hymyillen,
Minä itkin hänen hymyään.

On surullista nähdä uhrisavun
Tanssivan vapautustaan,
On surullista nähdä uhrisavun
Rakastavan kulkuaan.

Varo

Riuduimme tanssissa ajattomassa,

Katsoi ruumiita liikkuvia,
Jotka elivät tietämättään.
Minä vajosin suruun hänen puolestaan,
Hän säteili fyysisyyttään.
Vapina rakkauden vartaloissa,
Riensimme rakennukseen.

Varo
Uhrisavuun rakastumasta!
Varo!

Tulenlieskat vartalossaan,
Huulet verenkarvaisina
Räjähdystä janoten
Hän odottamaan laskeutui.
Hänen silmistään näin sairauden,
Joka aikaamme ravistaa.
Minä pistoolin kohotin katseeseen,
Joka alistui rakastamaan.

Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Now I know my love for her goes on

I read each word that you've sent to me
And though its past now, and your words...
All the memories I've had, still remain

I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no-one knows
Oh sure my friends all come 'round, 
But I'm in a crowd, and own my own
It's cos you're gone now, but your heart... heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No, you would not let me go

Seems I was wrong, 
But I love,  love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away 

But just remember...

If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder

She thought it was a duck
She put it on the table
With its legs sticking up

Papa broke his glasses
When he fell down drunk
Tried to drown the kitty cat
Turned out to be a skunk

You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know
You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know

Little Joe Billy
Went fishing for trout
Played hooky from school
'til the cops found out

Didn't have a father
Was an only child
And his momma never beat him
So he grew up wild

You gotta watch what you're doing
Yeah

I knew a girl
Sweet as could be
But she fell for men
Like a chain sawed tree

She listened to their lies
Was fooled by their charms
Now she's sitting
With a baby in her arms

You gotta watch what you're doing
Didn't you know
You gotta watch what you're doing
You oughta know that
You gotta watch out
Watch out

Well everything's fine
Till things get bad
Then you sit around thinking
Of the good times you had

But it ain't no good
To lead a life of sin
If you don't shape up
You know you'll never get in

You better watch what you're doing
Don't you know
You oughta know where you're going
Do you know

Some folks smile
They seem alright
Then you later find out
They were like demons in the night

Try to love everybody
But don't be blind
Cause some kind of people
Try to mess up your mind

You gotta watch who you know

Some people say that
God is dead
That He doesn't exist
Except inside your head

I wonder how many
Gonna be surprised
When they look straight up
And see Him coming through the skies

You gotta watch what you're doing
Cause He does, yeah
You know He watches what you're doing
Yes He does
And He knows where you're going
Yeah yeah yow

C'mon pilgrim
You know He loves you
He loves you more
Than He loves this cloven earth
Don't make your life bad
And start acting like and idiot

You better watch out
There's someone after you
It's the Devil
And he wants to lock you up in his zoo
He's got a nice little cage
Picked out just for you
I bet it fits real nice too
You gotta watch out

Watch what you're doing
Watch where you're going
Watch who you marry
Love who you bury

I was walking down the road
Just walking down the road
And I bumped into You

I had a dream which was a
Nightmare. it was the last
Time I saw fehrion. I was walking
Backwards, picking up the pieces
And looking for the footprints
Of the doctor. the butterfly had
Flown and a little wooden man said
""we sleep till He arrives."" but
They mad him go back five steps
Which placed him right here and
Also in the kitchen hanging on
To a dead phone and looking
At the chicken.

Two times seven
The clock struck eleven
And them seven days at the
Edge of space
And I told them, I've got to
Get back to earth

I feel like dying
Phase two is ensuing
Be careful what you sign
You gotta watch what you're doing"

Can I take it back with me?
Back to the flat with me?

Oh severed head
I'll feed your head with bread
And paint your lips bright red
I'll keep it fresh on ice
It will look very nice

Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me

Shrunken heads under the bed

The spit is turning
Roasting burning
Shadows dancing -- by the fire
Flickering flames laugh -- with desire

And sometimes it felt so wrong to never want to lean on you
You may stand tall, but I've got two feet too

Now we talked of you in bars around a quiet beer
Tell their tales of mine-gone stones where no one else can hear
And later on outside, they say they're gettin' on a plane
To fly away, leavin' you again

CHORUS:
California, my friends all call you home
And if you take away another, I'll be that much more alone
Is it my fault that my kind are always drawn toward the sun
Like a child to home whenever darkness comes

Now in a few more years, I won't remember what it was to play
The music of old friends who need to live so far away
But can I once taste northern waters, then forsake them for the South
To feel California's ashes in my mouth

Y a les bandes blanches qui défilent

Y a le vent qui siffle sous les tôles
Et le cri des pneus quand tu décolles
Et derrière toi la nuit qui retombe
Sur le sillage étroit de ta bombe
Est-ce que c'est ton cœur qui fait hurler la machine
Ou bien le moteur qui bat dans ta poitrine
Et qui propulse ton projectile

Pour pas sentir les doigts de la mort
Et ni les chiens qui aboient dans leur sommeil
Ni les hommes de loi que tu réveilles
Tu vois quelques tâches claires sur le dos des camions
Quelques mots de travers sur des panneaux bidons
Et ton sang fait monter les aiguilles
Jusqu'au rouge des feux que tu grilles

'Cause it is my favorite holiday 
But all this year's been a busy blur 
Don't think I have the energy

To add to my already mad rush 
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season. 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from

Last year, ski shop, 
Encounter, most interesting. 
Had his number but never the time 
Most of '81 passed along those lines.

So deck those halls, trim those trees 
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer, 
I just need to catch my breath, 
Christmas by myself this year.

Calendar picture, frozen landscape, 
Chilled this room for twenty-four days, 
Evergreens, sparkling snow 
Get this winter over with!

Flashback to springtime, saw him again, 
Would've been good to go for lunch, 
Couldn't agree when we were both free, 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime, 
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him? 
No, this time it was me, 
Sunburn in the third degree.

Now the calendar's just one page 
And, of course, I am excited 
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it.

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year. 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year. 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
But I think I'll miss this one this year.


Hardly dashing through the snow
Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls
'Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites.

Last fall I had a night to myself, 
Same guy called, halloween party, 
Waited all night for him to show, 
This time his car wouldn't go,

Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late, 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quiet way, unwind 
Doing Christmas right this time.

A&amp;P has provided me 
With the world's smallest turkey 
Already in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot?

So on with the boots, back out in the snow 
To the only all-night grocery, 
When what to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said. 
""Need a break; this year's been crazy."" 
I said, ""Me too, but why are you? 
You mean you forgot cranberries too?""

Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening 
That Christmas magic's brought this tale 
To a very happy ending! ""

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
Couldn't miss this one this year! 
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! 
Couldn't miss this one this year!

'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her.
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown.
And she danced without a net upon the wire.
I know a lots about her'cause you see. Baby is an awful lot like me.

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside. Leam how to hide our feelings, fly high and proud.
And if you should fall remember you almost had it all.

Baby saw the day they pulled the big top down.
They left be-hind her dreams among the litter. And the dif- f'rent kind of love she thought she'd found was nothing more than sawdust and sorne glitter. But baby can't be broken 'cause you see. She had the finest teacher, that's me.

I taught her don't cry out loud, just keep it inside. Leam how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud. And if you should fall remember you almost had it. Don't cry out loud, keep it inside.."

There's a feeling in the air
When the ground starts to tremble
The first attack is here
You won't stand a chance 
When the missiles start to fly
They never tell the people
Till the holocaust is here

When the fire's in the sky
You'll be running for your lives
When the fire's in the sky
Prepare yourselves to die

Where, where are the shelters
They said they would be there
You'll need, need some protection
From the radiation flare
Don't, don't start a panic
It won't do you no good
You'll just have to wait
For the end of all mankind

If you're near the point of impact
There's nowhere you can run
If the heatwave don't get you
The shockwave surely will
There won't be no more heroes
There's no one left to fight
It's the end of our planet
We'd commit eternal sight

When the fire's in the sky
You'll be running for your lives
When the fire's in the sky

We found we couldn't go on

We're going to break on through
We're hiding in the tall grass
Waiting for our signal to move
Our friends are inside
They were beaten they were tied
We've got to get them out
Before they blow our cover wide
Some sad GI Joe's
Mind wanders home
Thinks about a girl left behind

We're freedom fighters
And so we say
They like to tell us
That anyway
We still remain here
Though we don't belong

When he's feeling lonely
She'll laugh and say, 'Okay Joe'
When they hold real tight
In the dead of the night

Niemand zu sehen, der Erlösung verspricht

Mit jedem Ton fühl ich mich besser
Mit jedem Wort erkenn ich mehr von mir
Die Helden lügen für Geld mit schönen Worten
Wenn alles nicht stimmt, warum lieben wir sie noch?

Wohin geht der Weg? Was werde ich sehen?

And shuffles around in her candle-lit hovel
Like some kind of witch with blue fingers in mittens
She smells like the cat and the neighbours she sickens
The black and white T.V. has long seen a picture
The cross on the wall is a permanent fixture
The postman delivers the final reminders
She sells off her silver and poodles in China

Drinks to remember I, me and myself
And winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
Home is a love that I miss very much
So the past has been bottled and labelled with love

During the wartime, an American pilot
Made every air raid a time of excitement
She moved to his prairie and married the Texan
She learnt from a distance how love was a lesson
He became drinker and she became mother
She knew that one day she'd be one or the other
He ate himself older, drunk himself dizzy
Proud of her features, she kept herself pretty

Drinks to remember I, me and myself
And winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
Home is a love that I miss very much
So the past has been bottled and labelled with love

He, like a cowboy, died drunk in a slumber
Out on the porch in the middle of summer
She crossed the ocean back home to her family
But they had retired to roads that were sandy
She moved home alone without friends or relations
Lived in a world full of age reservations
On moth-eaten armchairs, she'd say that she'd sod all
The friends who had left her to drink from the bottle

Drinks to remember I, me and myself
And winds up the clock and knocks dust from the shelf
Home is a love that I miss very much
So the past has been bottled and labelled with love

Drinks to remember I, me and myself

You take my time you live my life for me
What have I done to rate this penalty
You suck me dry
My body cries

We stumble blindly chasing instant thrills and lasting memories

Accent on youth
Attention O
Ascends on you
O O

I scream with frustration and lost control
Open for the blows
My hands fall limp and hang down at my side
Take my soul and go

We stumble blindly chasing dancing lights and others' wishes

(Chorus)

Just let me close my eyes and slip away
Dream a dream alone
You give me just enough rope for the task
Let this man alone

We stumble blindly chasing silhouettes and vacant faces
So well rehearsed our moves once so grateful turn against us
We stalk dark passages, we're looking for that sweet surrender

Well his tummy couldn't hold them all
Oh no
No his tummy couldn't hold them all
And we say

Ooh good is good and bad is bad
As anybody knows
But too too much good can be as sadly sad
As too much bad you know"

They are green
Want everything

200,Gary Numan,Are 'Friends' Electric?,TRHXHLW128F92E2AEA,1981,"It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you

So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals and issues
And things that I just don't understand
Like a white lie that night
Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the 'friend' that I left in the hallway
""Please sit down.""
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed

You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no one to love

So I found out your reasons
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts and I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I miss you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see it meant everything to me"
201,John Denver,Gravel On The Ground,TRMFZND128F92D2EF4,1981,"If our lives could lie before us like a straight and narrow highway
So that we could see forever, long before we took the ride
We would never look to heaven, make a wish or climb a mountain
'Cause we'd always know the answer what's on the other side

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
This life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground

So let's walk the road together
Who knows what we'll find tomorrow
Maybe good times, maybe sorrow will be waitin' round the bend
Given time, two hearts discover what they're feelin' for each other
At the best we'll end up lovers, at the least we'll make a friend

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around
Tho' we all have destinations , and the dust will settle down
This life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground"

Don't need their credibility
""Destroy,"" they say, ""Defy! Condemn!""
As long as you don't destroy them
With twenty years of drugs and drink
I thought the time had come to think
About standing up and saying that
It's tragedy and such old hat

These feet won't stop they're in such a hurry
I knock it on the head and I go for a curry
Staying sober can be neat
Get drunk on these here happy feet
Keep on trying to pin me down

me tienen por muerta desde hace diez años
y yo
quiero salir.

Entre mil tumbas de mármol y piedra
mis familiares descansan en ellas
y yo
quiero salir.

Ya me he comido dos primos, tres tías
y a aquel cuñado que tan mal olía

from the work of the years

from the work of the years

He said ""Please come with me
to my home by the sea
We can smoke, drink and eat
and you'll sit at my feet
and I'll tell what I know
while the sea breezes blow
for I've tried to be free
but I'll soon have to go.""

And his house was his art
and, nature, his wish
it was sculpted from clay
in the shape of a fish

had been arched into stone

in Chicago for life
He is separate from me
and so is my wife
and I live in the sun

and what they'll do to me""

for miles by the shore
and we picked up the trash

Yes, we picked up the trash 
that they'd left by his door.

And the oil and the sludge 
got stuck to my feet

And the blade cut his hand
and it's stiff from the scar
and the butchers, called doctors,
leave you worse than you are
and we're all like the butchers
we cut into life
and we like to see blood
on the end of our knife.

And someday they will come
and bulldoze him down
for he has not a permit
from the kings of the town
No, he has not a permit
from the kings of the town

And the doctors will come
and say he's afraid
and they'll ruin this man
and destroy what he made

And the pictures he kept
will be torn from his hand
with the beautiful house
that he built on the sand"

Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you would
And maybe I'd still be here
You don't know me
Don't try anymore
When it's gone
We'll walk away
We'll move on

If you did
Would you watch as I leave you
Maybe you will

Trying to let go

Maybe I will still be here"

Reliving precious moments we knew

So many days have gone by
Still I'm so lonely and I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

Within the prison walls of my mind
There's still apart of you left behind
And though it hurts I'll get by
Without your loving yet I guess this just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind
Over you

And I guess there's just no getting over you
And there's nothing I can do
But spend all of my time out of my mind

Kicks for depression
Need my kicks for my aggression

Kick oppressors and oppression

Window shopping with my honey
Get my kicks feel alright
Sleep all day stay out all night

Fall about when I get tight
Get my kicks in bars
Soft lights and loud guitars

The Jellicle Moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball
Jellicle cats are black and white
Jellicle cats are rather small
Jellicle cats are merry and bright
And pleasant to hear when we caterwaul

Jellicle cats have cheerful faces
Jellicle cats have bright black eyes
We like to practice our airs and graces
And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise

Jellicle cats develop slowly
Jellicle cats are not too big
Jellicle cats are roly poly
We know how to dance a gavotte and a jig
Until the Jellicle Moon appears
We make our toilet and take our repose
Jellicles wash behind their ears
Jellicles dry between their toes

Jellicle cats are black and white
Jellicle cats are of moderate size
Jellicles jump like a jumping jack
Jellicle cats have moonlit eyes

We're quiet enough in the morning hours
We're quiet enough in the afternoon
Reserving our Terpsichorean powers
To dance by the light of the Jellicle Moon

Jellicle cats are black and white
Jellicle cats (as we said) are small
If it happens to be a stormy night
We will practice a caper or two in the hall

If it happens the sun is shining bright
You would say we have nothing to do at all
We are resting and saving ourselves to be bright
For the Jellicle Moon and Jellicle Ball

Jellicle cats come out tonight
Jellicle cats come one come all
The Jellicle Moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball"

Before she caught my eye

Oh, time just rolls on and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold on tight to your dream

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much, but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over and over and over you could

Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sens - ton coeur se briser
Accroche-toi à ton rêve

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much, but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over and over and over you could

Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream
Ooh, yeah, hold on tight to your dream
Yeah, yeah, hold on tight
To your dream"

Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

Can you feel that heartbeat under the sea?

With crowded streets in chromakey
And all the glow boys in their lipstick and shadows
And gold leaf on their delicate skins
Well they can filter through your curtains like nerve gas
They leave their laughter on the wind
And we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun
Nothing I can see looks like an exit
So I'm making you into a door
You've been a guaranteed constant companion for so long
I'll almost miss you when I go
And there's silence in your silver passing
And stardust scattered over your breasts
Then I looked around and found
All the faces of the world
As the ballroom floor gets fused to glass
And we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun
We'll walk in the silent places
In the wake of the storms
Swim through our own cathedral
Trailing the dawn
Dresses of light and ashes
Proud in display
Lovers and enemies
All waltzing in the waves
Oh we're dancing
Yes we're dancing
We're dancing like a gun"

Be out of the picture and off of the screen

From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

On wobbly knees

To help you along
You'll soon be a-growin' up strong

Oh, the long lazy mornings
In pastures of green
The sun on your withers
The wind in your mane

Could never prepare you
For what lies ahead
The run for the roses so red

And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand

It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time
You joined in the dance
It's high time 
You joined in the dance

From sire to sire
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare and
The strength of a stud

It's breeding
And it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you and carries you home

And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand

It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time

He got a head, like a head, like a head like soap
Stands about five feet off the ground
Like a poor man, a poor man is always down
Can't you see, cant you see how he runs all quick?
I hope someday he gets hit by a stick
He dropped it down, it dropped him down
He came up, came up cruising in across the ground
He sit down, he sit down, he sit down today
I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope he can cut his way
Fly, fly, flash with the wind
Good god, good god, good god, never see him

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder which way
You cruise the message, the message today
You stick to stick to stick to stick
What did you do about the fix?
How many lost and lost his head
How many men lost and lost his head
How many men, how many men lost his head?
I like to play one more time
Oh, I like to play one more time
Good god, don't let me down
How say the men underground?
Still bow your head down
For too many times he blows my horn
He says ""Come on, come on, come on
Good god, go!""

Too down, look up at the sky
Face to face say goodbye
Hard way to say you'll stay
Too many men lost and lost his head

Ring, ring two more times
I stay, I stay, I stay for the blast

Home again, home again, taking a job
Hope you can blow your mind you set above

And the horn blows on
Oh, the horn blows on
How the, the horn, the horns blowing on
And the horn, the horn blew, blew
Blew on

Just living lines from books we've read
With atmospheres of days gone by
With paper smiles
The screenplay calls a message for the nation

Chorus:

And those who sneer will fade and die
And those who laugh will surely fall
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall
The thin wall
Thin wall

Grey men who speak of victory
Shed light upon their stolen life
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music
To step in time and play the part
With velvet voices smooth and cold
Their power games a game no more
And long the chance to use it

(Chorus)

And those who dance will spin and turn
And those who wait will wait no more
And those talk will hear the word
And those who sneer will fade and die
And those who laugh will surely fall
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall
The thin wall
Thin wall

The thin wall (Repeat 3 times)

And those who dance
The thin wall
And those who talk
The thin wall

There is no England, anarchy is right
But don't contradict or try to fight
It's always dark, there is no light

And now the day is over, just an hour to go
I tried to phone last night but you didn't answer
Just left me ringing on the line

Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside

My face in the mirror shows the break in time
A crack in the ocean which does not align
I tried to sleep last night but i've caught your dreaming
About days we used to wonder away

Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside

Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name
Another night over babe another light comes on in vain

And my days on earth are through

Planted in love by a being far beyond this...
What can it be? Such a sweet yet painful feeling came over me...

Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes, indeed...

I am the bird that cannot be caged completely,
Even though I long to spread my wings so bittersweetly...
What will I do? Shall I hold my love in silence?
Wonder if you feel it too!

Knowing this can never be,
Does it hurt me? Yes, indeed...

I've heard it said that all is fair in love and war,
But tell it like it is - Does the distance hide the scar?
Living our lives all alone, changing,
Never really knowing what games we're playing, oh, baby...
Laughing, when we should have both been praying;
Living, I'm living a lie...

You are the rush and the flow of every river,
Soft as the touch of love when you want to be the giver...
How do I know? When I guess I just imagined, painfully so...

Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes, indeed, yes, indeed, baby!
Do I love you? Yes, indeed...

You broke my spirit, you broke my spirit...
All those nights I cried, tears I tried to hide;
You broke my spirit, you broke my spirit...

Do I love you? Do I love you? Do I love you? Yes, yes indeed!
Knowing this can never be,
Do I love you? Yes, indeed..."

Laid off since last summer

This town is like a prison
And I just got to make my break
They say ""Be cautious, little mister""

It isn't very hard to do
And you will find happiness without an end, if you pretend

Remember any one can dream
And nothings bad as it may seem
The little things you havn't got, could be a lot
If you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call your own
Just close your eyes and you'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call your own
Just close your eyes and you'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend

Just smile everyone,
You'll be on t.v. tonight that's right

It's so much easier than the pills you can take
I go through moorgate and i'm wide awake
But no bloody driver's gone and made a mistake,
That's yet
Is it me that needs a home?
Not likely, vicarious of living rids your boredom

[outro poem]
And oh as yes, the sky did turn to night
I shield my eyes and hide from the bright of day
And cast the stone, deep into the field of man
And hide in shame and low the flag, raised in vain
And close my mind to this lost day
And shield my body with ferns of grey
And ask no more of life unsaved and smile no more,
And lay here scaved become the tombstone of my grave"

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him

There's a feeling I get when I look to the sun
Love, it's so tough
Cause it raises your hopes and then it makes you run

We're all looking for a shorter day
We're all looking for an easy way
Even when the debts are dead and gone

Down, the stairs
And an eight mile drive waits for you to turn on
Hear, the time clocks sing
And the smoke in the distance reaches the eye line

We're all working on a shorter day...

No conversation as you go
There's so much space the heat moves you
Terracotta homes, backyard barbeque and eucalyptus smell
It's fine on the clothes line
It's fast food and slow life and red roof
My silence, comic interruptions
Surely there's some relief from atomic art
And the fragile state of world events
With clowns who love the kings and power and the mutant media babes
Wanking on dreams and fashions and toilet paper flowers
Don't talk to me in this backyard - it's clandestine, it's nuclear
Smell of space and now forever I wanna go
Straight down the exit eight mile attraction
U-turn is up and the time clock sings lets go

Lucky country
Where the geckos are paid to live in the sun
On and on there's a ribbon of road and a mile to spare
Lucky country
Lucky country

Someday we'll be together
Played ypur part so well
You really had me fooled 
The big breakdown scene
But think about it now
Oh it wa cruel
And it was mean
Oh but when i think of 
When i think of just how it
Could have been
When each love burns out
And it will without a doubt
You'll come running back
Back to me
Yes you will, you'll see"
304,Delta 5,Journey,TRUSFCB128F9326535,1981,"Journey in the dark
This trail is wrenched apart
The votes are on the wall
Leaves the wrong impression

Of all our days together
It gives another backdrop
To an exercise in acting
Which didn't lapse once

Silence and suspicions
Or tears and local loves
I detach the cord
My arms each in the light
My arms each in the light
Which didn't lapse once
Which didn't lapse once

One knows the truth
One knows nothing
One knows nothing
One knows the truth
One knows the truth
One knows nothing
One knows nothing 
One knows the truth

You only know what you know
One knows the truth
One knows nothing
One knows nothing
One knows the truth"
305,Aztec Camera,We Could Send Letters,TRGLKJB128F14685A8,1981,"You said you're free, for me that says it all
You're free to push me and I'm free to fall
So if we weaken we can call it stress
You've got my trust, I've got your home address
And now the only chance that we could take
Is the chance that someone else won't make it all come true

We're making tracks that show our touch and go
And now it's touch and come, and you should know
But then four years won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed

Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send letters

While you were gone I reached another town
They couldn't help me, but they showed me round
And now I've seen what you can't understand
I'd try to lead you but I'd crush your hand

Because the people in the village know
It doesn't matter where you choose to go
The end's the same

I found some blood I wasn't meant to find
I found some feelings that we'd left behind
But then some blood won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed

Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send letters

I found some blood I wasn't meant to find
I found some feelings that we'd left behind
But then some blood won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed

Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send letters"
306,Wall Of Voodoo,Crack The Bell,TRHDHZH128F933A6E3,1981,"{spoken:} Thanks a lot, thanks a whole lot.
Lulu sends her friends
They cover the mouths with one hand
Well, I keep waiting here
Drifting around in a dark land
Envelope unturned
« I push the stamp and stick it »
Chorus:
And I know there's a bell to crack
And I know there's a bell to crack
Well, I hear crosstalk now
Coming through the wire
One voice tells me yes
The other is a liar
Chorus:
And I know there's a bell to crack

I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
« Click-clack, joint, » this thing is on my sleeve
All this mess around and I gotta clean it up
Okay, Mister Questions, you tell me, when are we gonna leave?
And can you design a hearta heart that doesn't bleed?
Chorus:
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
See the bell, so I crack it
You just can't find good bells anymore!
Yah! Yah! Sure!
Tom Shane's a friend of mine!
I really like himhe's in the industry!
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack
I know there's gotta be one more bell to crack"

Beat me beat me
Yeah, use a truncheon or a household brick
Beat me beat me
There's so much happiness behind these tears
Beat me beat me
I pray you'll beat me
For ten thousand years
Beat me beat me

I'm black and blue baby
I love you
Be your dog
For just one flog
You don't hear me plead
For you to make me bleed
Beat me beat me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Well use a truncheon or a cricket bat
Beat me beat me
A good beatings really where its at
Beat me beat me"

There is unemployment misery despair
Really want to leave my trouble I'm going to the fair
Love is getting rough oh yes i know
Excuse me but I've got to go

You run the risk of being a bore
Tell me all about that nuclear war
I don't wanna sing to the fuhrer
God knows!
