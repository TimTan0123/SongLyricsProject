0,"Arthur ""Big Boy"" Crudup",Mean Old 'Frisco Blues,TRHFKEE128F429FB4C,1943,"Well that mean old old frisco
And that lowdown santa fe
Done took my babe away
Lord and blowed back at me

Yes my mama told me
Papa told me too
Son every woman scream in your face
Lord she ain't no friend to you

Lord I wonder
Do she ever think of me
Well I wonder I wonder
Will my babe come back to me

Yes I'm standing and looking
Watching that southern whistle blow
Well she didn't catch that southern
Lord now where did the woman go

Lord I ain't got no
Special rider here
I might leave
because I don't feel welcome here"
1,Bing Crosby,I'll Be Home For Christmas,TRGVTHT12903CFB7BC,1943,"I'll be home for christmas;
You can plan on me.
Please have snow and mis-tle-toe
And presents on the tree.

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams.
I'll be home for christmas
If only in my dreams.

I'll be home for christmas;
You can plan on me.
Please have snow and mis-tle-toe
And presents on the tree.

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams.
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams"

Everyone to be happy, because when you're happy, that's what counts""

Brothers and sisters and sisterettes
Deacon Jones sends his deepest regrets
To the members of the flock who are new around here
There's somethin' 'bout the deacon that I wanna make clear

Who's honored and respected? (Deacon Jones)
Now who's so unaffected? (Deacon Jones)
When the sinner's moanin' low, who will share his tale of woe?
Lordy, Lord Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Who's so handsome and good lookin'? (Deacon Jones) Ummm Hmmm Ummm
Who can smell a rooster cookin'? (Deacon Jones) The good ole Deke
Who gets all the chicken breast and leaves the giblets for the rest?
Lordy, Lord Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Deacon Jones (Deacon Jones) Deacon Jones (Ho Deacon Jones)
Lordy, Lord Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Now who will keep a siser singin'? (Deacon Jones)  Umm Hmmm Ummm Hmmmm
Who will also keep her phone a ringin'? (Deacon Jones)  Yes, yes
And when she's left all alone at night, who will help her see the light?
Lordy, Lord, Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Now who's loved by all the congregation?  (Deacon Jones)  Yes, yes brother
And who gives them consolation? (Deacon Jones) Umm hmmm  Umm hmmm
When a sister's feelin' blue, who is it that consoles here in her pew?
Lordy Lord, Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Deacon Jones (Deacon Jones) Deacon Jones (Ho Deacon Jones)
Lordy, Lord Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Now who's the country's greatest lover?  (Deacon Jones) Yes, yes
Who makes all the other cats take cover?  (Deacon Jones)  Umm hmmm
And when your gal is leavin' you, now just tell me, who is she goin' to?
Lordy Lord, Hallelujah Deacon Jones

Now, who takes up all the contributions? (Deacon Jones)  Yes, yes
And ah, who tends to their distribution? (Deacon Jones)
And before any of the dough is spent, who is it that takes out his 10 percent?
