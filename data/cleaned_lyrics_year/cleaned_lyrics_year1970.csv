Well now death don't have no mercy in this land

Death don't have no mercy in this land

Death will leave you standin' and cryin' in this land
Death will leave you standin' and cryin' in this land
He'll come to your house and he won't stay long

1,Diana Ross,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,TRCHHIC128F422B9CC,1970,"Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry

You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs
The thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling
Let it be me

Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

(No wind) No wind
(No rain) No rain
(Or winter's cold Can stop me baby) Ooh baby
(Baby) Baby
(If you're my goal) Oh
(No wind) No wind
(No rain) No rain
(Can stop me baby) If you are my goal

Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh

I know, I know you must follow the sun
Where ever it leads
But remember, if you should fall short of your desires
Remember life's holds to you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my lovin'
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close
Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you the day I set you free

(Ain't no mountain high enough) Oh
(Ain't no valley low enough) Ooh
(Ain't no river wide enough) Ooh
To keep me from you

(Ain't no mountain high enough) Ow
(Ain't no valley low enough) Say it again
(Ain't no river wide enough) Hey
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you
Ain't no mountain high enough (no)
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough (oh)
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough (yeah yeah)
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you
(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)

Nothing in this world
(Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough)
Nothing in this world to keep me from you
(Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you)"

Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong
Take a bright star and a-place it on your forehead
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Take a black cat and you sit it on your shoulder
And in the morning you'll know all you know

3,Quatermass,Good Lord Knows,TRFSDFE128F934EDE1,1970,"Willow weep on me
Sad long rosary
Good Lord hides when I become a man
Where's my family

Cold December wind
Have I really sinned
Good Lord needs to show me I'm a man
Making love's beginned

Waiting all our lives
Make love with our wives
Good Lord knows a child is being born
Please lay down your knives

Go and fight your war
Rich fight 'til you're poor
Good Lord knows they won't be coming home
Still they ask for more"

Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away

In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost
Please, please, baby lemonade

I'm screaming, I met you this way
You're nice to me like ice
In the clock they sent through a washing machine
Come around, make it soon, so alone
Please, please, baby lemonade

In the sad town
Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away

In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost

Crossed by your own kind
You're lost but you don't find
Grope through the dark blindly
Search and you hope find the

Friends that you don't need
Their trends make your mind bleed
Their ways can't be your ways
Their days will be short days

Life is a bad time
Using your mind wrong
Dreams are for night time
Leaving your days long

Drowned in your own Hell
You turned to the Big Spell
You found that you soon fell
And pounds in your hands welcomed

Friends that you don't need
Their trends make your mind bleed
Their ways can't be your ways
Their days will be short days

Life is a bad time
Using your mind wrong
Dreams are for night time
Leaving your days long"

We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
Lord, don't you know
Have made me a time with a poor man's lady

Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune.

Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me, we go in style
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store bought woman
You make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on

Play it now
Play it now
Play it now, my baby

Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
We got all night
To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah"

I was down with my face on the floor.

Now I'm standing with back to the wall
Waiting, praying the ceiling don't fall
Well, I once thought that I knew it all
Now I'm standing with back to the wall.

Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say : 'I'll drop you a line'
Well now she's gone away
Just took time to say : 'I'll see you some time'.

Well, now she's gone away

Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
I wish I had you to talk to

If a man ever needed dying, he did
No one had a right to say, what he said about you
And it's so cold and lonely here without you
Out there, the law is coming, I've been so tired of running

Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
I wish I had you to talk to

It hurts to see the man that I've become
To know, I'll never see the morning sunshine on the land
I'll never see your smiling face or touch your hand
If just once more I could see, you, our home and our little baby

Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
I wish I had you to talk to

I hope this letter finds its way to you
Forgive me love for the shame I've put you through and all the tears
Hang on love to the memories of those happy years
Red lights are flashing around me, good Lord, it looks like they found me

Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there
Indiana wants me, Lord, I can't go back there

11,Syd Barrett,Effervescing Elephant,TRMCUEW128E0781ABB,1970,"An Effervescing Elephant
With tiny eyes and great big trunk
Once whispered to the tiny ear
The ear of one inferior
That by next June he'd die, oh yeah
Because the tiger would roam
The little one said
""Oh my goodness I must stay at home""
And every time I hear a growl
I'll know the tiger's on the prowl
But I'll be really safe, you know
The elephant he told me so
Everyone was nervy, oh yeah
And the message was spread
To zebra, mongoose, and the dirty hippopotamus
Who wallowed in the mud and chewed
His spicy hippo-plankton food
And tended to ignore the word
Preferring to survey a herd
Of stupid water bison, oh yeah
And all the jungle took fright
And ran around for all the day and the night
But all in vain, because, you see
The tiger came and said
""Who me? You know I wouldn't hurt not one of you
I'd much prefer something to chew
And your all to scant."" Oh yeah
He ate the elephant"

Walking the streets, I call your name
But no one comes
Running through the town, I call your name
But no, no one hears

Shadows forming, where can I begin?
(Darkness is closing in)
Doors all closed and window curtains drawn
(All the people have gone)

Walking the streets, I call your name

Running through the town, I call your name
But no, no one hears

Together we can make it right, mmm...mmm...
 
Now when you're feelin' bad, I am feelin' it too

How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me

My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

You rule my very soul

You are my every dream

15,Black Sabbath,Iron Man,TRIYGTT12903CD3D5C,1970,"I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all?
Or, if he moves, will he fall?

Is he live or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again"
16,Gordon Lightfoot,If You Could Read My Mind,TRYRSQZ128F9307EB4,1970,"If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old-time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back"

I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

And when I'm out, I see you walkin'
Why don't your eyes see me?
And could it be you've found another game to play?
What did Mama say to me?

""That's the way, oh, that's the way it oughta be""
Yeah, yeah
Mama said, ""That's the way it oughta stay""

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes?
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dyin'
Had they got ya hypnotized?

And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it
When all your ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it oughta stay?

You love to wake up somewhere new
And find another day""

And imagine country scenes
For among the rich
Within four walls and out of reach

To show that she is free

To wander back again
To see her friends and me?

Smile so brightly
Come on boy come on boy
Oh Take a walk with me"

Gonna love you anyway.
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine.

And everyone I knew was there.
Had the love that would last forever.
Everywhere I looked, I saw you standing there. 

Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine.
Get up; get your man a bottle of red wine.
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head.
I said get up right now, oh oh.
I said get up right now.

Amoreena's in the cornfield, brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean,
Laughing, fit to burst, upon each other

I can see you sitting, eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, whoa, like a puppy child

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean,
Laughing, fit to burst, on each other

Oh if only, I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders, the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh, I miss you Amoreena, like the king bee misses honey.

And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean,
Laughing, fit to burst, on each other

Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed, I gained a day and lost a bloody year
And I would like to know
How do you feel (how do you feel)?
How do you feel (how do you feel)?

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninety-five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?
Just you let me know
How do you feel (how do you feel)?
How do you feel (how do you feel)?

34,Ringo Starr,Silent Homecoming (1995 Digital Remaster),TRDAJZZ128F42ACB3F,1970,"Patiently she stares down the runway,
Today's the day that he is coming home.
Seems like he's been gone a life time
And a life time is a long time to be gone.
But there are songs that need singing,
And there are things that must be done.
There are thoughts that still need thinking,
And there are wars that must be won.

He was just a boy when they sent for him
And overnight turned him into a man.
Proudly he had served his country
In a war he didn't seem to understand.
The flag still waves, his war is over,
He'll never have to kill again.
And as she waits, she thinks it over,
Is winning worth the prize we pay to win?

Her thoughts keep wandering to his childhood,
When all his hand grenades were merely toys.
And ""war"" was just a game that he was playing
With plastic guns like other little boys.
And ev'ry day when play was over,
He'd put his little toys away.
And she'd be standing, waiting for him,
The way she's waiting here today.

As the plane stops she starts thinking,
Will he still look the way he did before?
Or will his eyes reflect the pain of killing,
Like most young men when they come home from war?
These last few minutes seem like hours,
She tries her best not to cry.
But there's that hearse filled up with flowers,
Did he really have to die?
No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no,
No, no,
No, no,
No, no, no,
No,
No, no, no,
No,

And move ahead to another day

Lost in the love of you

She looks my way
I smile the light of day
She tries to ply her way with me
She knows so little of my way
And the way it is
She couldn't guess
And I'll remain unknown
She thinks I'm great
And all I've got is the need to be alone
For I'm lost, lost in the love of you
Lost in the love of you.

And thinkin' back on sadder times
I'm in the need to know
By days and ways to come
And what I should and shouldn't show
The smile could make the sunshine
Pour inside on a string
The rain comes down, thunder roars
And I'm alone again
And gone, gone in the love of you
Lost in the love of you."

""Where can I get a steely skipper to sail this mighty boat of mine?""

Then up there spoke a bonny boy, sitting at the King's right knee
""Sir Patrick Spens is the very best seaman that ever sailed upon the sea""

The King has written a broad letter and sealed it up with his own right hand
Sending word unto Sir Patrick to come to him at his command

""An enemy then this must be who told the lie concerning me
For I was never a very good seaman, nor ever do intend to be""

""Last night I saw the new moon clear with the old moon in her hair
And that is a sign since we were born that means there'll be a deadly storm""

They had not sailed upon the deep a day, a day but barely free
When loud and boisterous blew the winds and loud and noisy blew the sea

Then up there came a mermaiden, a comb and glass all in her hand
""Here's to you my merry young men for you'll not see dry land again""

""Long may my lady stand with a lantern in her hand
Before she sees my bonny ship come sailing homeward to dry land""

There lies good Sir Patrick Spens with the Scots lords at his feet"

And when I feel that way
I thirst and I want to shout it
Trust me Lord to be    Quiet About It

Yes I am Lost
But He is leading me home
He's my companion
When my friends have up and gone

But it seems like only wrong gets out

Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means. 

Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time 

Wait for the day 
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause? 
Living in the memory of a love that never was 
Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
and I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine 
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time."

The message came that I've lost you
To the warmth of another man

For heaven sakes, girl, don't do this to me

I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper

So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason I just thought you had to be there

But, oh my love, you've lost it
Oh, my love, she's gone
My love, you've lost it
She's long gone

For heaven sakes, girl, don't do this to me

I simply must have been crazy
I must have been out of my mind
To overlook the need in you
How could I have been so blind

Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
But now I'm begging, my baby, please, please, please

But oh, my love, you've lost it
Oh, my love, she's gone
My love, you've lost it

Our hearts aren't beating wildly as they beat before
And when we hold each other in our arms
We can't receive the same vibrations anymore

And when we hear each other speak our names
We don't hear the ringing and the singing of a million bells
Perhaps our hearing's failing us
Perhaps we're hearing other things but who can tell

It could be said that way
It could be said that way
But I'd much rather say
It's time for me to go

What's the point in making leaving any harder
Than a leaving really ought to be
And this road on which I travel
Paved with broken glass and gravel
Has just room for me, I hope there's room for me

I suspect that I'll be lonely
But I know that if I'm lonely I'll deserve to be
And I plan to think about you
Just as often as I will and that's my plans for me

It could be said that way
It could be said that way

Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood she said it's just fine
Times were hard for us for quite a while
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child she tried to ease my mind
And for my woman's love for my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love

Through the years of moving town to town
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found
And wondering if we would ever settle down her love never died
And if I have many things today I owe it to the love I had along the way
No matter what went wrong no matter come what may she stood by my side
And for my woman's love...

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we worked hard
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter."

What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech.

That the song up there is you.
They can't take it from you
If you don't give it away,
Don't give it away.
Ooh, it's given away.

It's just a thought,

Just about a lifetime to explain,

Now let's read the rays of the other day

With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible

Flyin' too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy
And he said
And even a jelly fish will agree to that

Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floatin' around so long
Lord he ain't got a bone in his jelly back
Floatin' every day and every night
Ridin' high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible

With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible

With the power of soul
(Power of you)
Anything is possible
(Anything you wanna do)

With the power of you
(With the power of you)
Anything you wanna do
(Anything you wanna do)

With the power of soul
(Soul, soul, soul)
Anything is possible
(Soul, soul, soul)

With the power of soul
Anything that you wanna do

Yes, I've been a fool, now I realize.

If I can't walk, I'll fly
If I can't sing, I'll cry.

I hit the ground, made me feel a whole lot better
Ain't no sense for her to go, well, how can I just let her ?

Now if I can't walk, I'll fly
If I can't sing, I'll cry.

You broke my heart, put tears into my eyes
You must go your way, I know how fast I've crashed.

Well, if I can't walk, I'll fly
If I can't sing, I'll cry.

If I can't walk, I'll fly
If I can't sing, I'll die
If I can't sing, I'll cry."

Or taking a ride on a cosmic train.
Switch on summer from a slot machine.
Yes, get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything.

I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas.
And you make them long, and you make them tough,
But they just go on and on, and it seems that you can't get off.

Oh, I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well, you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air,
But will you keep on building higher
Till there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way,
We're changing day to day,
But tell me, where do the children play?"

No one seems to care as much
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much
Have we lost the touch that means so much
Have we lost the human touch

No one wants to be alone
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone
Have we lost the touch that does so much
Have we lost the human touch

Touch me now and let me know
Hold me tight so I can go
Through this misery unafraid
And really knowin' what lift is all about

No one wants to live alone
Who wants to smile, laugh or cry alone
Have we lost the touch that means so much
Have we lost the human touch
Yes, yes, yes"

Up every morning at five while it's still dark out
Wipe the sleep from my eyes and then I walk out
The morning mist still lingers on the grass
Just one last kiss before the night has passed.

The sun begins to rise a golden yellow
Lighting up the sky through field and meadow
The world's still turning going round and round
The crops are growing turning golden brown.

Mother Earth, God bless you
May the Lord protect and keep you.

The wind will stir the trees, I'll watch them swaying
A cold refreshing breeze like children playing
Daybreak to sunset I will watch the sky
From a cold December to a warm July.

Mother Earth, God bless you
May the Lord protect and keep you."

His magic voice, now there's no noise

Did he stop you going on?

Guess my shadow spoke to me tonight
And made me throw my dreams away
Told a story of a twisted man
Who was playing with some foolish plan
About a girl who'd have her way

Sometimes shadows are near
I see things very clear
My life unwinds
Somewhere I'll make my stand
Look round at yesterday
And change my mind

Now your shadow isn't always there
In the light of cloudy days
Or in circles where you hide from view
All the doubts that ever bothered you
And where people lose your name"

And my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine

And just riding around

Footprints on your carpet

Sit down at the table

Yes I know I'm to blame and I feel so ashamed
That I made her the image of me.

I met her in a little country town
She was settled and old-fashioned in some ways
But she loved me till I dragged her down
Then she just gave up and drifted away.

She drinks and she talks just a little too loud
And with her black gown she hangs around with any old crowd

98,Clarence Carter,Patches,TRNMGOK128F93496FC,1970,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad

The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule

So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home

But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through

'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me

Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""

Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

When love is in your heart

Help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight 

They know that Santa's on his way 
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh 
And every mother's child is on the spy 
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two 
Though it has been said many times, many ways

His jacket was a deep sky blue, it was, I do declare
For to reive the topsails up against the mast
And to sail across the sea, stormy sea
And sail across the stormy sea

But you are very lonely, because all the other fish fear you
And you crave companionship and someone to call your own
Because for the whole of your life you've been living alone

On a black day in a black month at the black bottom of the sea
Your mother gave birth to you and died immediately
'Cos you can't have two killers living in the same pad
And when your mother knew that her time had come, she was really rather glad

Death in the sea, death in the sea
Somebody please come and help me, come and help me
Death in the sea, death in the sea
Somebody please come and help me, come and help me

Fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I
Fishes can't fly, fishes can't fly
Fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I

Now I'm really rather like you for I've killed all the love I ever had
By not doing all I ought to and by leaving my mind coming bad
And I too am a killer, for emotion runs as deep as flesh
Yes, and I too am so lonely, and I wish that I could forget

We haven't come so far to lose our way

Look at me, I believe it's true
You're a part of me, I'm a part of you

Love is only what we come to live
The waking, breathing and all we give
A crystal passing reflected in our eyes
Eclipsing all the jealousy and lies

Look at me, can't you see it's true
You're a part of me, I'm a part of you

Quiet as the voices in a dream
Without two shadows the things I've seen

So you feel free to turn the key
And walk right through the door

You won’t be intruding
'Cause they’re  ain’t nobody lives here anymore
But once a love in hand in hand they came
Though they never shared a common name
She dressed here love and stately pride
And wear it downtown
And pity all the lovers once
Who’d look at her in all her love and frown

I can see you find it hard to find the beauty in these rooms
So old and worn
But through the eyes of love they shown brightly
As a bright summer porch
They hang a blanket at the window
To help keep out the sun
And fell on the bed
Where they’d sleep through the afternoon
She’d fall asleep and know that he’d find her
Somewhere in his dreams
And he’d lie awake and try
And find the words to tell her
Things just weren’t the way they seemed

There’s the door that he walked through
When he finally found the nerve to say all the things
She would’ve sworn he’d never say
She watched him through this window
As he walked into the world yesterday
And she wondered if he’d thrown the key away

There’s the kitchen table
Where she sat and tried to dry her eyes

In the swamp where she stayed so long

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Depends on what you want

Though I was still a kid 
And I smile like the sun 
To think of all the loving that we did 
She rose each morning and went off to work 
And she kept me with her pay 
I was making sweet love all night 
And playing this old  guitar all day 
And I got apple cider and homemade bread 
That would make a man kneel down he would say grace 
And clean linens on our bed 
And a warm feet fire place

With a million flaming trees

Tie a rope around his waist, and throw him in the swamp

Lived a man called Doc Milsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left 'cause the alligator bit it
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow

Well the sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp trappin' alligator skins
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again

152,Lindisfarne,We Can Swing Together,TRBDEKL128F1458E5F,1970,"No-one came to criticize, no-one to complain,
just to pass a little bit of time, play some human games.
Some were smoking 'roll your owns', while others they had none,
ev'rybody was holding hands, and singing this little song.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

Then when things were happening, around about ten to four,
there was a screeching of brakes, dogs barking outside, and a hammering on the door.
Then the voice of officialdom, saying 'Open in the name of the law',
but we just kept on holding hands, and singing this song some more.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

Then they broke down all the doors, and kicked the windows in,
they let their doggies off the leads, and they ransacked everything.
They stood us all against the wall, their faces split with grins,
and then they linked each others' handcuffs and they merrily began to sing.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

They took us to see the County Judge, with a wig-hat on his head,
he heard our case with a smile on his face, and this is what he said:
I'll have to send you all to jail, for doing this terrible thing.
And as I walked down to the cells, I swear I heard him sing.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night.

We can swing together, 'cause we feel we're doing it right.
We can swing together, we can swing all through the night."

We had right on our side

And from his throne the King of England's son
This man alone united all as one
Oh, he'd inspire, words of fire, glory sought, death was nought
We had right on our side

We laughed though knowing death was near
Forgetting wives and children dear
And hoping that our friends would see
How well we killed the enemy

We bloodied ruthless every sword
Each dedicated to our Lord
And tortured captives with no mind
To victims' widows left behind"

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
And grace my Fears relieved; 
How precious did that grace appear 
The hour I first believed! 

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come; 
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,

And all the ways of war
Won't change it in the end

So I've been searching for the dolphin in the sea
And sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me?

Now sometimes I'm just sitting around
Thinking about Saturday's child
And all about the time
We were running wild

And I keep searching for the dolphin in the sea
And sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me?

Now I'm not the one to tell this world
Just how to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all hate is gone

So I've been searching for the dolphin in the sea
And sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me?

I was half the way down, treading the sand
Please

Please lift a hand
I'm only a person
Whose armbands beat on his hands, hang tall
Won't you miss me?
Wouldn't you miss me at all?

The poppy birds way
Swing twigs coffee brands around
Brandish her wand with a feathery tongue
My head kissed the ground
I was half the way down, treading the sand

Please lift the hand

I tattooed my brain all the way

Got to get back to the land

We are billion-year-old carbon

And I feel myself a cog 
In somethin' turning

And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are stardust, we are golden

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves

Leaving me alone with someone who I only knew by sight
So we sat and watched each other through the fading firelight
Each one waiting for the silence to be broken
And the things I should have said
That were whispering in my head
Would not be spoken

The black-eyed master glared at me with malice in his eye
The spittle from his twisted lips ran down to his bow-tie
I was dumb before his accusations I dared not deny
When he done with me I stood outside there shattered 
And the things I should have said
That came rushing to my head
No longer mattered

Teachers from whose mellowed mouths great pearls of wisdom crawl
To those who scrawl obscenities upon the alley walls
The joke is on the bloke who never spoke a word at all
But whose dreams lay unrevealed 'til they were rotten
And the things I should have said
That I was keeping in my head
Have been forgotten

The things I should have said (repeat to fade)"

A statue wearin' high heels
Look at all the happy
Creatures dancing on the lawn
A Dinosaur Victrola
List'ning to Buck Owens

Tambourines and elephants
Are playing in the band

On the flyin' spoon?

You hold her thinking
I'm not alone
You're still alone

You don't live for her
You do live with her
You're scared she's starting
To drift away
And scared she'll stay

Bad get worse

She's got a fine sense of humour when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache in the night like a thief

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

And I need her in the daytime (I need her)
And I need her in the night (I need her)
And I want to throw my arms around her (I need her)
And kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
Gives me some sweet lovin' brightens up my day
Yet it makes me righteous, yes it makes me whole
Yet it makes me mellow down into my soul

It's so hard for me
To stand here all alone
When you could be
Taking me for a ride

Ooh, sha la la, the weather
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
I shot my baby"

To Paris and to Rome
And I've never found a place that I
Could really call my own
But there's one place where I know
The sun is shining endlessly
And it's calling me across the sea
So I must get back to San Bernadino

I remember when I was sixteen
My daddy said to me
""You could travel round this universe
""Until eternity,
""But you'll never find that peace of mind
""That you've been dreamin' of,
""Not until you finally decide 
""To come on home to San Bernadino.""

Oh, I'm longin' for
San Bernadino
Oh, I'm longin' for
San Bernadino

I've been all along the water
Right up to the Rio Grande
And I've never found that paradise
They call the promised land
I was young and foolishly
I thought the world was at my feet
But I'm no different now and so*
I'm homeward bound for San Bernadino

Well I'm older and I'm wiser
And I've seen the light of day
And I think it's time to realise
My dreams have gone astray
But I tried so hard to reach that star
That was so far away
So now I gotta find that road 
That's leading home to San Bernadino

Oh, I'm longin' for
San Bernadino
Oh, I'm longin' for
San Bernadino"

And we've got time to kill
What a thrill
June and July

We've got all our love
Buckets of
The tears that we cried

Now we don't cry no more
Gonna bolt the door
Don't know what we've got but it feels like a lot
We don't need no more

When my day's work is done
We can take in a jamboree
But I just wanna sit down by the fire
With my love right here beside me

We've got time to kill
Catskill
Sweet by and by

We've got all our love
The sky above
The twinkle in your eye

Now where the wheel might roll
Is where my love and I shall go
We're gonna plant the seed, there ain't nothing we need
We found our own rainbow

My love wants to have her fortune read
And I know that she's in a hurry
If we go along the straight and narrow
You don't even have to worry

We've got time to kill
Standin' still
Go on, give it a try

Don't eat no caviar

Holding winged insects in front of his eyes

Living their lives, just fearing to die

Cardboard and leather and synthetic fiber
Don't cover his body or flutter his mind
The earth is like Heaven and the water like cider
He walks on the ground and he flies in the sky

Monk in the glass house was breaking his fingers
Doing his penance for someone to see
The head in the alley was licking his papers
And thinking, ?He's thinking he's better than me?

He is but wisdom who looks on the youngster
Thriving, surviving, contriving but free
And if in his wanderings, he should pass your doorstep
Strike up your matches, there's so much to see"

I put him off with lies

I had to face the truth

Drivin' trough the poundin' rain

Windshield wiper splashin',
Splashin', callin' out her name
Just gotta see Jane
I left her arms to find my way

To find a place for me in the world outside
I wasn't alive, I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, turned my heart cold inside

I gotta find what I left behind
Red light, green light,
Speedin' through the dark night,
Drivin' through the poundin' rain,

I gotta see Jane
Freeway, byway,
Earin' up the highway,
Runnin' up a world insane

Just gotta see Jane
A town of steel that isn't real
It could not feel what's in the heart of me
I was so alone in a world of stone

I missed her arms, that once held me
That made me see, I was the lonely one
But now and then I was runnin' scared
And I could feel the touch of time

Turnin' the wheel of life to yesterday
When love and happiness were mine
I gotta find that world of Jane and me
Liked it used to be

Oh, I gotta see Jane
Her love for me I pushed aside
Walked out alone
To face a world turned cold

Although I tried I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, it's not a part of me
I've gotta find what I left behind

Oh, I gotta see Jane, I gotta see Jane"

We lived in a one-room cabin
One room full of love and that was all
That was all

Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
Way up high where the spirits run free
Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
What a wonderful place to raise a little family

And in the morning mist
We would climb to the top of that mountain
And lie in the [pools?] all covered with green
Was like it's just been kissed
On the eyes by the tears of Jesus
A more beautiful sight I've never seen
What a beautiful scene

Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
Way up high – why, it was heavenly
Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
What a wonderful place for you and me

You don't have to climb a mountain
You don't have to swim the sea
You don't have to build white towers
You are as as happy as you see

But I can't find anyone 
To put my question to 

And when I'm older and wiser 
And I look back on my youth 
Will I be contented or will I see 
Nothing but a vain search for the truth 

And when I'm old and wiser 
And I look back on my youth 
Will I be contented or will I see 
Nothing but a vain search for the truth 

I wish I knew better baby 
My mind wouldn't be so sore 
Some day a door will open 
Then I'll know then I'll see 
What I'm striving for 

I'm looking in from the outside 
I wish my mind could read the score 
Some day a door will open 'faint' search.  No, 
Then I'll know then I'll see 
What I'm striving for 

If I could get an answer 
If someone would give me a clue 
I know I'd feel much better 
But I can't find anyone 
To put my question to"
197,Savoy Brown,Poor Girl,TRQEKPM128F425F130,1970,"This is a story 'bout a poor girl, a story that you ought to know 
She lived all alone in a one room flat on a street where the lights are low 
Every night about the same time she'd go and put her glad rags on 
Go to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long 
She's a poor girl 

Born and raised in the country she got tired of pushing a plow 
She take my train to the city and mother you should look at her now 
With her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat 
Around her neck to top it off she even wears a persian cat 
She's a poor girl 

That was the story of the poor girl but now she uses her head 
She's back home working on the land instead of playing in bed 
The fast life she was living took her as it's prey 
Now she's back in the country getting fatter every day 
She's a Poor Girl"
198,Kris Kristofferson,Me and Bobby McGee,TRNWHIH12903D16860,1970,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains,
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans.
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained,
Took us all the way to New Orleans.
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues,
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew.

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose,
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free,
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues,
And buddy, that was good enough for me,
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun,
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul,
Standin' right beside me through everythin' I done,
And every night she kept me from the cold.
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away,
She was lookin' for the love I hope she'll find,
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday,
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine.

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose,
And nothin' left was all she left to me,
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues,
And buddy, that was good enough for me.
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee."
199,Elton John,I Need You To Turn To,TROMITW128EF342BCE,1970,"You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights.
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love.  Your love protects my fears.

And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind,
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind.
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold.

Did you paint your smile on when I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling, but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle, with the grace of a dove.

And I wonder sometimes, and I know I'm unkind,
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind.
Oh I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold."

Well all i owned was hanging on my back

Gonna save my money, get rich I know

201,Faces,Three Button Hand Me Down (LP Version),TRWRDPE128F9341D6C,1970,"I don't need no one's opinion
On the matter concerning my dress.
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma,
There were many things I did not possess.
I never complained, because my father said,
""Son you'll get your chance before you're my age"".
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit
Written all over his face

He said, ""Others may come and others may go,
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down
Three button hand me down

I had my fair share of neat women,
But they came between me and my suit.
That was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston,
Not forgetting the one in Detroit.
They said, ""We like you boy and we think you're sweet,
But can't you lose your suit?""
I said, ""No, you can't do that to me""
I remember what my father said:

He said, ""Others may come and others may go,
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down, ha ha,
Three button hand me down

I've never been a tidy dresser
And the fold in my trousers it ain't straight.
Still I know a good cloth when I see one.
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit.
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor
And get myself a smooth outfit.
Then I remember what my father said to me.
I'll make you from the open road

He said, ""Others may come and others may go,
But that suit will be around wherever you go""
Three button hand me down,
Three button hand me down"

Nothing you do could make me feel towards you
What you obviously feel towards me
Nothing I hear from you is more than a mere excuse
Confirming my every fear

And that's that even if dogs could fly that you and I
Never could however hard we try
Get things back together then do all the little things again
We did before the gulf became too wide

Nothing you do can make your words appear true
Too consistent were your lies to me
Nothing you say could mean the same things again
You're no good and that's all I'll believe"
203,Grand Funk Railroad,Nothing Is The Same,TRJWZZH128F1462CB2,1970,"When I was feeling 'bout sixteen, I never had no idea.
Listen to me if you want to know what I mean, your expression will let me see.
I never knew what I was looking for, I never had the time.
And now that time has opened up my door, now I'm looking forward just to see what, just what's mine.


When I was feeling 'bout eighteen, it's then when I began to see.
No matter how hard you push on the door, it won't open without the key.
Opportunity only knocks once, if you shut it out it's a sin.
And when something keeps right on poundin', then, my friend, you'd better let it in.


Now I feel just a little bit old and, sadness fills my brain.
I can flash to future years and nothing is the same.
Nothing is the same.
Nothing is the same.
Nothing is the same."

and smiled and gazed all over my arm 
she loves to see me get down to ground 
she hasn't time just to be with me 
her face between all she means to be 
to be extreme, just to be extreme 
a broken pier on the wavy sea 
she wonders why for all she wants to see... 
But I got up and I stomped around 
and hid the piece where the trees touch the ground... 

The end of truth that lay out the time 
spent lazing here on a painting dream 
a mile or more in a foreign clime 
to see farther inside of me. 

And looking high up into the sky 
I breathe as the water streams over me..."

You're lost in the dark - you can trust me.
'Cause you know that's how it must be.

Lisa - Lisa, sad Lisa - Lisa.

Her eyes like windows trickelin' rain
Upon the pain getting deeper.
Though my love wants to relieve her.
She walks alone from wall to wall.
Lost in her hall, she can't hear me.
Though I know she likes to be near me.

Lisa - Lisa, sad Lisa - Lisa.

She sits in a corner by the door.
There must be more I can tell her.
If she really wants me to help her.
I'll do what I can to show her the way.
And maybe one day I will free her.
Though I know no one can see her.

Give me little love from her heart 

Bopping down by the whirlpool 
I met a girl she was god's tool 
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock 
But could it give me love 
Give me little love from god's heart 

Walking down by the westwind 
I met a boy he was my friend 
I said boy we could sing it too 
And we do 
Give us love 
Give us little love 
Give us little love from your hearts 

And then we'll walk."

Sitting all alone I hear the tapping of the rain 
Dance ballerina dance 
Talking with the rain in some small city I feel the pain, 
she's dancing all alone 
Thinking how we'd wait together 
sitting by the fire in weather just like this 
Playing lovers' games; hoping the rain would never end 
And I thought about the night we met 
How the gentle rain fell down,  kissed the ground 
Then I knew no one ever could take your place 

Nothing seems the same but the falling rain 
You've gone away 
Walking by the sea; sitting beneath a tree; 
You are not here.."

Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the theories of Freud,
He has taught me all the evils that my ego must avoid.
Repression of the impulses resuling paranoid
As the id goes marching on.
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
As the id goes marching on.
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol - or something else -
And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
As the id goes marching on.
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the cheques
As the id goes marching on.
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man
As the id goes marching on.
Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on

Freud's mystic world of meaning needn't have us mystified
It's really very simple what the psyche tries to hide:
A thing is a phallic symbol if it's longer than it's wide
As the id goes marching on.

211,Leonard Cohen,Avalanche,TRAWNCE128F4278892,1970,"Well I stepped into an avalanche,
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed;
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

Do not dress in those rags for me,
I know you are not poor;
You don't love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure,
It is your turn, beloved,
It is your flesh that I wear."

Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

Stoned me just like Jelly Roll

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home

And the rain let up and the sun came up and we were gettin' dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim and we jumped right in, not to mention fishing poles

Oh, the water

Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

And it stoned me to my soul

And it stoned me

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin' home

On the way back home, we sang a song but our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road with the sunshine in his eyes
Well, he lived all alone in his own little home with a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you and he said, ""Hey, there you are""

When your path I spied
Wake up in the rainy morning
You'll be satisfied

Gonna wrap up my love in silver paper
Give it all to you
Use it on some rainy morning
It'll show you what to do

Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in
Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in, yeah"

Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
Maisie, his illuminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie, lay in the hall
With diamonds and emeralds
Maisie, Maisie...
Bad luck - the bride of a bull

Maisie lay in the wall with her emeralds
And diamond brooch, beyond reproach
Bad luck - bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light...

I got my papers, I got my pay

Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come
I'm goin' back to the place that I love

Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love

Got no time for explanations, got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleepin' underneath the moon
At Yellow River

Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time from
Yellow River

I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes

And everyone's got them a few

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone
And the path is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy
When you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy
When each road you take
Is one more mistake
And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home

We all like to climb to the heights, I know
Where our fantasy world can be found

When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand

Oh, You talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Oh, if you ever needed help, a friend was there
Some good neighbor, helped lift your burdens
Oh and the simple joys of life your friends would share

But the times are harder and the people are changin'
Today most folks couldn't tell you, who their next door neighbors are
All the guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain't this ol' world takin' hate and fear just a little too far

Let's talk about the good times, let's talk about the good times
I wish, I could just go back to the days I'm speakin' of
When a friend would meet you and a smile would greet you
What this ol' world needs now is old fashioned love

Play the guitar
Well alright

Well, my old granddaddy, God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
He said, ""Son this world is so full of hate and venom
An' I can't wait to leave this ol' place and rest on the other side""

""Oh, you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
When I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days

Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away""

""Go saddle me my black mare
The grey is ne'er so speedy
And I'll ride all night and I'll ride all day
Till I overtake my lady""

On the grass so wet and dewy
And seated with her gypsy lad
It's there he spied his lady

Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your own true love
And the promises you gave me?""

Or even my wee baby?
What care I for my own true love

Stretch out your hand, glad feel

la frase conosciuta, la storia già narrata.

Lui e lei, a leggere i poeti che nessuno al mondo poi leggerà mai.
Lui e lei, riempire di sospiri lunghe pause di pensieri mentre il suono del silenzio li accompagna...

Lui e lei s'incontrano d'accordo nel consueto vecchio posto d'ogni giorno.
Lui e lei ritrovano ogni cosa che già il tempo ha ricoperto con la noia.

Ed ogni giorno ormai sentirsi raccontare la storia conosciuta,

Half as cold as all the people I've found.
Every way I try to go here seems to bring me down.
I've seen about enough to know where I belong.

I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
On that old white line between my heart and home.
Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays
Sittin' in a park alone.
So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
Any lovin' way but wrong.
Tell 'em that the pride of just the other side o nowhere's
Goin' home.

Takin' nothin' back to show there 
For these dues I've paid.
But the soul I almost sold here
And the body I've been givin' away.
Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here,
Headin' for the light of day,
Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home.

Straight-backed chair and a table where he sits when he's able
To walk over from bedridden misery
To record from his thoughts on a worn out table cloth
Where he'd been while his mind breaks sleeplessly.

Though his body's bent with age, you know he's still out on that stage
Entertaining all his friends that pause to greet him at the door
Forty-nine years out on the road, many nights he'd saved a soul
Now he sits and waits to claim his own reward.

God's own singer of songs is going home
Though he's poor, might be the richest one you know
All his pain will set him free
Wash his soul and cleans him clean
God's own singer of songs is going home
God's own singer of songs is going home."

Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain.

Living reflections from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years between.

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these
To think of us again?
And I do.

And now a thousand years between."

Up and down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West back along the line
I'm going now to the place that's best that old hometown of mine

Eight more miles and Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart

There's bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a traveling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville"

and pour upon his head

do I hear
the daybreak
world stop turning
listen to my heartache
world stop turning

and fight off the day
for when this night is over
he has to go away

are those footsteps walking
world stop turning
yes there's someone turning

so now was the future
that can never be

please stop turning
world stop turning

What do you do when the people go home
And what do you do when the show is all done
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine
A line from a poem of my childhood has said
That visions of sugarplums were gonna dance in my head
I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
But I'll still have a bowl of leftover wine
I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'll sing them a song of mine
You know I'm gonna do anything
Just to take up time
Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine
(and) what do you do when the people go home
And what do you do when the show is all done
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine
I'm gonna spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'm gonna run to the people
And I'll sing them a song of mine
You know I'm gonna do anything
Just to take up time
Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine
I'll drink some of yours
If you'll drink all of mine
Because I can't stand the taste of that leftover wine
And I'm gonna drink some of yours

Laughing madly at the sun. 
Though I wanted to sleep late today 
The Battle's just begun. 

Oh, the Devil in all his wisdom 
The father in all his grace 
The servant's sons are washed in blood 
And the man has run his race 

A moving target looms behind the street where soldiers stood 
Siren screams out desperately 
Like only humans could 
And standing on my balcony 
I watch the battle run 
Yes the war is never over 
But the day is never done 

Oh, the Devil in all his wisdom, 
the father in all his grace, 
The servant's sons are washed in blood 
And the man has run his race. 

Six-white horses like the wind are running, 
Five are far behind 
The captain lost his daughter, 
The sergeant lost his mind. 
The soldiers they still scream for riches 
Even though they swore 
That sons and daughters wouldn't live 
Unless we won the war.

Clouds of mystery pouring
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Trying to find the sun
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

I went down Virginia
Seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

Heard the singers playing
How we cheered for more
Crowd had rushed together
Trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring
Falling on my ears
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?"

He could never make it big 'til the night he took a swig
From his homebrewed Belladonna Moonshine

At the start of his show from behind his banjo
He's take out a bottle and he'd drink it down slow
Then he'd sing like a choir and his strings'd catch fire
From his home brewed Belladonna Moonshine

Where Jeremiah went was the biggest event
That the people ever saw , it was money well spent
They'd travel from afar, Jeremiah was a star
On his home brewed Belladonna Moonshine

Everybody cried when Jeremiah died
A bottle and his banjo lyin' at his side
The cause was the same as the cause of his fame
It was home brewed Belladonna Moonshine

Cos he's got em all singin' up in Kingdom Come
But St Peter at the gate made him promise not to make

Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And I am bound on oath, my love, to serve in a foreign land

I'll dress myself in uniform, and I'll see Egypt too
I'll march beneath your banner while fortune it do smile
And we'll comfort one another on the banks of the Nile

But your waist it is too slender, and your fingers they are too small
In the sultry suns of Egypt your rosy cheeks would spoil
Where the cannons they do rattle, when the bullets they do fly
And the silver trumpets sound so loud to hide the dismal cries

Oh, cursed be those cruel wars, that ever they began
For they have robbed our country of manys the handsome men
They've robbed us of our sweethearts while their bodies they feed the lions
On the dry and sandy deserts which are the banks of the Nile"

Abdu'l-Baha is thought to have said, ""Make me a hollow reed from which the pith of self
hath been blown so that I may become a clear channel through which Thy love may flow to others"".
The rest of the ""prayer"" is a poem written by George Thompson and published in the Star of the West. --Kent)

Make me as a hollow reed, that I may play and plant Thy seed.
Rascal's closet may be lit, and have a needy rhyme in it.
Make me as a flute of stone that when I play Thy wind is blown.
Rascal's hideaway might chill, and die away from sill to sill.
Hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed.

Make me as a hollow reed that I may sing your grace, my steed.
Rascal's secret will be seen in its decay and sickening green.
Make me as a proof in turn, I will prove to them that yearn.
Rascal's lie is manifest and never could survive your test.
Hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed.

Make me as a hollow reed so I may give them what they need.
Rascal's reign will come to end and monarch's eyes will shine again.
Make me strong for I am weak, give me words and I will speak
. Rascal's cheeks will burn in shame when all of us know Your Name.
Hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed.
Hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed, hollow reed."

That you were the cause of it all

You brought me sunshine and joy
And said that true love was calling
Now you are the cause that these teardrops are falling

Heartaches tomorrow go hand-in-hand with sorry
And you were the cause of it all

The vows that were broken would have been best unspoken
And never been uttered at all
Lips that were nimble bring tears I can't dissemble
And you were the cause of it all

I had a place in your heart but my blue skies have clouded
With all your new loves I find your heart's overcrowded
Your romance restricted, and I've been evicted

Quicker than I can bat an eye
Since you were telling me goodbye

Oh, just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seem to disappear
Sweetness was only heartaches camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
(You promised that love we forever share)
(But all I have are memories of love that was never there)

We use to meet in romantic places
You gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed

Oh, just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seem to disappear
The way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
(You brought me up just to throw me down)
(You left me and my dreams shattered all on the ground)

Oh, oh, oh you only feel me with despair
By showing love that wasn't there
Oh, just like the desert shows a thirsty man
Green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

Between a handful of blues
Double indemnity

All the words are wrong, and my shadow's gettin' long
I realise this song don't mean much
I've got an ache in my head, I wanna go to bed
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up

Yeah, wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
'Cause it's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way, and it's true what they say
That I'm the black sheep of the family"
270,Ry Cooder,Alimony,TRNABQF128F9340187,1970,"Look at this one, look at that one 
Tell me do they look like me 
All my friends said, don't you worry 
Said they'll testify for me 
Well, I wonder which of my friends had it in for me 
Alimony, alimony, alimony is killing me 
I don't want six extra children 
When ain't but two that look like me 
Please, have mercy, judge your honor 
Alimony is killing me 

Please, have mercy, judge your honor 
I'm as poor as I can be 
Ain't had money in my pockets 
Since way back in fifty three 
Can't you cut down all my payment? 
Alimony is killing me 
Alimony, alimony, alimony is killing me 
Alimony, alimony, alimony is killing me"
271,Johnny Winter,Ain't That A Kindness,TRSCQJM128F427DABF,1970,"It had rained for three days straight
But the sun was beginning to shine
Two riders were approachin'
But they were no friends of mine.
Called out for Hanna
And I kept here close to my side
Whistled for old Thunder
And my horse he was ready to ride

I give you everything I had babe
Ain't that kindness
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain't that kindness
Don't you know I give you my love when you're sad babe
Ain't that kindness

Hmmm you know a man ain't nothing without his gun
You know a man ain't nothing without his gun

Took to the road six nights and days
Only then did we think it was safe
I heard the sound of 2 men approachin'
But they did not hesitate
Hanna she was cryin'
But she wouldn't let go of my leg
Thunder he was tired
Been a thinkin' of a better day

I give you everything I had babe
Ain't that kindness.
I give you the good with the bad babe
Ain't that kindness.
I give you my love when you're sad babe
Ain't that kindness.
Oh but you know a man ain't nothing without his gun
You know a man ain't nothing without his gun.

Two shots fired and two figures fell,
There was blood flowin' over the ground
Two men dead in the noon day sun
And they never ever made a sound.
Hanna she never forgave me
And I think I know the reason why
When I called out for Thunder
The horse he up and died.
I give you everything I had babe
Ain't that kindness.
Give you the good with the bad babe
Ain't that kindness.
Don't you know i give you my love when you're sad
Ain't that kindness.

Mh but you know a man ain't nothing without his gun
You know a man ain't nothing without his gun
You know a man ain't nothing without his gun."
272,The Partridge Family,Point Me In The Direction Of Albuquerque,TRRUSYL128F92ED094,1970,"Window walkin' downtown, feelin' mighty good
And I noticed from the corner how all alone she stood
Underneath the lamplight, an angel in disguise
Lonely little runaway with teardrops in her eyes

Crazy little ragdoll, her hair was wild and tossed
And I put my arm around her 'cause I knew that she was lost
She didn't seem to notice that anyone was near
'Til suddenly she turned to me and whispered in my ear

Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I want to go home and help me get home
Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I need to get home, need to get home

Showed me a ticket for a Greyhound bus
Her head was lost in time
She didn't know who or where she was
""And anyone that helps me is a real good friend of mine""
(Real good friend of mine)

Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
And help me get home, help me get home

Walked her to the station and kissed away the tears
Knowing I'd remember through all the coming years
Ragdoll on that Greyhound who waved with all her might
Weeped against the window as the bus rolled out of sight

Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I want to go home and help me get home
Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I need to get home, need to get home
Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I need to get home, need to get home"
