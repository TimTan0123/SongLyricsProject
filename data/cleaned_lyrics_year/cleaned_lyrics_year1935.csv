'Cause she's strickly, tailor made
Boy, she ain't no hand me down
Catch you messin' with her, boy

Oh, keep yo' hands off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

She got some little bitty hands
An them great big legs
She sho' look good
'Cause everybody says it

But keep yo' hands off her
Don't ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
Told you last night
You know she don't belong to you

Oh, keep yo' hands off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

Keep yo' hand off her
Now, don't ya dare to touch her
Know she don't belong to you

An that real curly hair

Because the day I'll catch you wit' her
Boy, that's the day you gon' die

Keep yo' hands off her
Told ya dare to touch her
You know she don't belong to you
Know she don't belong to you"

My mean stepfather is gwine give me a place to lay

I am, ma'am, a little boy, done cried all night long

5,Big Joe Williams,Wild Cow Blues,TREYZEY128F421E946,1935,"Yes, I got up this mornin', I was feelin' awful bad
I was thinkin' 'bout the good times, mama, hmmm, Lord, me and my baby once have had

Well, I woke up this mornin', I looked down the road
Think I heard my wild cow, mama, when she begin to low
If you see my wild cow, buddy, please tell her ""Hurry home""
Lord, I ain't had no milk and butter since my wild cow been gone

I'm gwine to the border, just to hear my wild cow moan
Play it, man!
Lord, I'm gwine to the border, just to hear my wild cow moan
Yes, she moans so lonesome, I'm gonna bring my wild cow home

My wild cow got a horn, just long as your right arm
Gives so much milk and butter that I hate to see my wild cow leave home
If you see that wild cow, please tell her ""Come back home""
Lord, I ain't had no milk and butter, since my wild cow been gone

It take a rubber ball to roll, and a rockin' chair to rock
The girl I'm lovin' to talk that old baby talk
Lord, I don't feel welcome, I said, please, nowhere I go
Lord, that good girl I'm lovin', she done drove me away my door

You can read out your hymnbook, preach out your bible, too
Fall down on your knees, ask the Good Lord to help you, 'cause you're gonna
Need, you's gwine need my help someday
You won't quit your runnin' around, woman, please, quit your low-down ways
Play it, man!

Lord, I went home last night, I looked out my door
There was some other man had my wild cow, she couldn't low
If you see my wild cow, please drive her back home
Lord, I ain't had no milk and butter, since he stole my wild cow and gone

Mmmm, ""Good mornin', Blues, how do you do?""
Mmmm, ""Good mornin'"", I said, ""Blues, how do you do?
I cried all night long, though and I can't get along with you."""

And it's all about that stockyard fire
Big trouble in the meat house
And it's all about that stockyard fire
All of the poor people kickin'
Because meat is gone up so higher

Let me tell you people
What that old stockyard fire will do
Let me tell you people
What that old stockyard fire will do
It will have you eating one
And it will have you skippin? two

That old stockyard fire
Left people in misery
That stockyard fire
Left people in misery
It's got upset and wondering
Lord, what will the end be

That old stockyard fire
Sure did raise some sin
That old stockyard fire
Sure did raise some sin
Lord, it's got so many people
Eating out of the garbage can

Now I hope these stockyard dealers
Could read these poor people's mind
If these stockyard dealers
Could read these poor people's mind
They would drop meat more lower
And avoid wasted trouble and time"
