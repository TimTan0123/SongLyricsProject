0,Bessie Smith,Young Woman's Blues,TRJBDVE128F9306FDB,1940,"Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day
Felt on the right side of my pilla', my man gad gone away
By this pilla' he left a note readin', ""I'm sorry, Jane, you got my goat
No time to marry, no time to settle down""
I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round
I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round
Some people call me a Hobo,
Some call me a bum
Nobody knows my name, nobody knows what I've done
I'm as good as any woman in your town
I ain't no high yeller,
I'm a deep killer of brown
I ain't gonna marry, ain't gonna settle down
I'm gonna drink good Moonshine
And rub these browns down
See that long lonesome road
Lawd, you know it's gotta and I'm a good woman and I can get plenty men"

Never will forget that day
When they had me in Parchman Jail
Would no one even come and go my bail
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days I would be sittin' down
I would be sittin' down lookin' down on my clothes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes

So many days when the day would be cold
They would car' me out in the rain and cold
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days when the day would be cold

You can stand and look at these convict toes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days I would be
Walkin' down the road
I can hardly walk for lookin' down on my clothes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes

Never will forget that day
When they taken my clothes
Taken my citizen's clothes
And throwed them away
Wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes.

Well there's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed

Ooh, well some of us goin' to wail

Spoken:
That's that fast Special Streamline
Leavin' outta Memphis, Tennessee
Goin' into New Orleans. 
She runnin' so fast the hobos don't
Fool with this train. They stand on the
Track with their hat in their hands.

I had a friend girl that mornin' was
Catchin' that train.
She got up singin' this song:

Sings:
'Hey Dad, I'm sorry to leave my home 
Mm-mm-mm
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lordy'

Spoken:
She heard that 8:30 local blowin' that
Mornin'. She hadn't rid the train in a good while. 
She thought it'd have that Special Streamline.
She heard at 8:30 local when she is comin'
To the line, declared up for that Streamline
Blowin' like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

She said, 'Daddy, is that my train?'
I say, I ain't keepin' up with the train time
I'm tryin-a make a few dimes.'
She dropped her head went to singin'
An cryin':

Sings:
'It's alright how you turn me down
Mm-mm-mm
I ain't got a dime

Spoken:
After she called for a ticket
She heard this Special Streamline
Going 36 miles from Memphis, Tennessee. 
Make ya lonesome now
Cause I hobo myself, sometimes.

(plays guitar &amp; w/wshbrd)

Man asks her, 'Where the other train?'
She told him she didn't know 

If she heard a bell she could tell him all about it.
As she dropped over that hill
And stopped off in the valley
She heard the bell begin to toll like this:

(plays guitar  w/wshbrd)
'Make a sound like a church bell toll'.

Before she got to that ten mile tunnel
She blowed and throw'd on the airbrakes.

(plays guitar &amp; w/wshbrd)

Airbrakes!

When she got to that ten mile tunnel
She was gettin' close
She was tippin cars on automatic switch
Gettin' her water and coal on the fly
You could hear her when she was strikin'
That double iron like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

When she run 'cross the last one
She squalled in.

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

This girl looked out an seen that train
She commenced to singin' an cryin'.

Sings:
'Hey, dad I don't wanna leave'
Mm-mm
I believe I'll lose my mind'

When that train got a little closer
Down to New Orleans, she went around
That curve, you would hear her 
When she's blowin' like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

The people's always standin' at the station
Lyin' there to see that train come in.
You would hear her when she squalls.

(plays guitar w/wshbrd - to end)

Spoken:

'Boy, ev'rywhere but here'

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I miss you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all some day

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But not you've left me and love another
You have shattered all my dreams

My bedroom is so lonely, every dog gone thing is wrong
You know I aint had no milk and butter, since my Jersey Belles been gone

My milk cow has been gone, three long weeks today
Im wonderin, what is keepin my Jersey Belle away?
If I ever get my Jersey Belle back, shell never go way no more

I know my Jersey Belle, boys by the way she low
Shell call me. She s call me so many times before
If I ever get her back home again, Ill never let my Jersey Belle leave no more

Ive got a good milk cow, but her head is hard like a block of wood
She s a number one Jersey cow, but her head is like a block of wood
Boys, its a mighty tough titty, but the milk is so dog gone good

I know my Jersey Belle, by the way she chew her cud
She kicks over the milk all the time, she wont be gentle like a good cow should
Boys, its a very tough titty, but the milk is so dog gone good"

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I been hearin' his name all over the land

Well, what is a vigilante man?
Tell me, what is a vigilante man?
Has he got a gun and a club in his hand?
Is that is a vigilante man? 

Rainy night down in the engine house
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain
Was that a vigilante man? 

Stormy days we passed the time away
Sleepin' in some good warm place
Man come along an' we give him a little race
Was that a vigilante man? 

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man
And he said, ""Unite all you working men""
Killed him in the river some strange man
Was that a vigilante man? 

Oh, why does a vigilante man
Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down? 

I rambled 'round from town to town
I rambled 'round from town to town
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle
Was that the vigilante men? 

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've heard his name all over this land"
