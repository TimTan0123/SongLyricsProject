Then we shot the bastard dead
With a nick nack paddy whack
Give a dog a bone
Send the stupid bastards home

The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again

Tu ra lu ra laddy
Got pissed in Limavaddy
Got a kicking from the locals
There's a bunch of drunkin' paddys
With a nick nack paddy whack
Give a dog a bone
Send the stupid bastards home

The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again

I shot one, I shot two, I shot three
That's more than you
With a nick nack paddy whack
Give a dog a bone
Send the stupid bastards home

The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again
The nation's gonna rise again

1,Nana Mouskouri,Tous Les Arbres Sont En Fleurs,TRKHZYL128F145A491,1997,"Tous les arbres sont en fleurs
Et la forêt a ces couleurs
Que tu aimais
Les pommiers roses sur fond bleu
Ont le parfum des jours heureux
Rien n'a changé
Un peu de neige est restée
La neige que tu enlevais
Je m'en souviens
En m'éveillant je ne voyais
Que le printemps qui grandissait
Dans notre jardin
Tu riais comme un enfant
Tu ne faisais jamais semblant
Lorsque tu riais
Quand tes yeux clairs me regardaient
Tu savais lire à travers moi
Chaque pensée
Tu étais si fort et pourtant
Je te berçais comme un enfant
Quand tu pleurais
Je t'ai fait du mal bien des fois
Pourtant toute ma vie c'est toi
Que j'aimerai
Pierre je t'aime
Je n'avais que toi
Mais tu n'es plus qu'une ombre
Qui dort auprès de moi

Lorsque je rentrais tard parfois
Tu ne t'endormais pas sans moi
Tu m'attendais
Tu m'as parlé toute une nuit
De ce que serait notre vie
Si je voulais
Un soir d'orage avant Noël
Tu m'as dit qu'il faisait soleil
Et j'y croyais
Je me souviens, tu me disais
Qu'on ne se quitterait jamais
Et j'y croyais
Pierre je t'aime
Je n'avais que toi
Et tu n'es plus qu'une ombre
Qui dort près de moi

Pourquoi ces fleurs dans le jardin
Cette nuit bleue illuminée
Par les étoiles?
Je sens que le printemps revient
Mais qu'il ne me sert plus à rien
Qu'à me faire mal
Malgré tout, malgré le temps
Je te revois rire et courir
A travers champs
Ce fût mon dernier vrai printemps
Tu t'es endormi pour longtemps
Pour trop longtemps
Dans un autre monde très loin
Y a parait-il un jardin
Plus beau qu'ici
Un grand théâtre où mon amour
Joue et continue chaque jour
D'aimer la vie"
2,Con Funk Shun,Got To Be Enough,TRJPHUL128F14775BB,1997,"The things I do for you
I do for no one else
The things I give to you
Usually keep them for myself

Every chance I take with you
'Cause my luck is on the one
Your tricks, your treat, they can't be beat
They keep me on the run

Places that you wanna go
I'll take you anytime
Cash to buy you pretty things
I'm working overtime

You take all the lovin', baby
That my body has to give
Run with my affections, girl
As long as you may live

I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I wanna be your stuff, girl

I've got to be enough, girl

3,Anggun,A Rose In The Wind,TRJDEPO128F4278E53,1997,"I was born at daybreak / To the road i did take
Trembling as the ground shakes / Under my feet
Cracked in the stone heat

Never ending motion / Way across the ocean
Into your devotion / Long have i gone
So far from my home

What to do with this love that i'm in?
I have given you all of my soul
Flying all my life like a rose in the wind
Tell me why i am always alone
On my way home

Dreaming always begins / Find a door that's opening
Something there is shining / The light in your eyes
When you were all mine

All alone as i wake / Moving in a new place
Shivering as i trace / A road of my own
Cut by the deep cold

What to do with this love that i'm in?
I have given you all of my soul
Flying all of my life like a rose in the wind
Tell me why i am always alone
Hang on to me tight, and a rose in the wind
Will be with you wherever you go
All the way back home

Can i take you back there? / Drifting on the warm air
Say you'll follow me anywhere / All of our nights
Into the jade skies

I'll be true to you / Flying over the moon
Lying in the bamboo / I'll always know
The light in the window

What to do with this love that i'm in?
I have given you all of my soul
Flying all of my life like a rose in the wind
Tell me why i am always alone"
4,Lori Carson,Snow Come Down (Album Version),TRDNCXW128F147BDF9,1997,"I think you feel, the way I feel
Though you don't want to say
I think you feel, the way I feel
Though it's not the easy way

Wouldn't you like to be with me
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow....

I don't want to cause you any pain
I just want to love you
I don't want to fuck up anything
I just want to love you
And, I know you think I'm kinda strange
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you

Everytime I see your face
I can hardly breathe
Everytime I see your face
I feel stupid and happy

Wouldn't you like to be with me
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow....

I don't want to cause you any pain
I just want to love you
I don't want to fuck up anything
I just want to love you
And, I know you think I'm kinda strange
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you

I'd sure like to be with you
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow....

I don't want to cause you any pain
I'd give you the world
I don't want to fuck up anything
I wanna be your girl
And, I know you think I'm kinda strange
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you
I just want to love you....

Ahhh---Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow come down
Watching the snow..."
5,God Dethroned,The Somberness Of Winter,TRMOSFF128F934B272,1997,"Searching the Northern passage to the Indies
And yes we found the northern passage.
The northern passage to hell

This world it turned into ice
The sun has set for the months to come
A landscape in the twilight zone
The somberness of winter

I walk between pools of frozen blood
It's 1896 my voyage has stranded before the gates of hell
Doom is in my eyes
Our ships is stuck in the ice
I don't know where we are
and I don't know where we'll go
Travelling. Endlessly. Like in a labyrinth
The forst is hardening my breath
The dark gaps in the ice reflect the thoughts of my wrecked mind
The only company I have is the skeleton that never leaves my side

Did we reach the ninth ring of hell?
There where the traitors freeze

The northern passage to hell (Nova Zembla)
Nothing left to eat but ourselves (Nova Zembla)

I hear the clapping of hooves behind me
I know my time had come to die.
I await his embrace.
I've fallen from grace.
I'll never reach home
The somberness of winter

Clear blue sky
I look out your bedroom window
Clear blue sky

Jet planes go smokin'
Jet planes go smokin'
Jet planes, they go flyin' by

Wanna tell her sometime
Give her something that she don't know
Wanna tell you sometime
My son, that you don't know

Before I leave here
Before I leave here
'Fore I leave you here below

Jet planes leave a trail of smoke, yes
They will not let love be
Jet planes, they leave a trail of smoke, yes
They will not let love be

Child, don't look for
Sister, don't look for
Mama, do not look for me

8,All-Star United,Tenderness,TRFKGHH128F9309128,1997,"Hush baby, don't cry
Just try to remember the time
When all your pitfalls and fears
Became mine
And we fall apart
Just one thing takes me back to the start

Chorus:
Tenderness
Put my heart to rest
Your tenderness
Hits me to the bone
Tenderness
When my head's a mess
Your tenderness
Keeps me coming home

Hush baby, don't cry
This rings in my head all the time
And still
I tend to forget your words
When I'm the swan in my full dive
Just one thing keeps me alive

And so it seems to me
To all of us here
The answer is clear
That you need a little less stress
And some more tenderness

9,Sarah McLachlan,Adia,TRMQXNK128F42AE1AC,1997,"Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy let it go

Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter

Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent

10,59 Times the Pain,Neither Question Nor Disagree,TRRUUJO128F427908A,1997,"Locked up in your safe world
And assured that no one can get in
Living a life you'll never make me understand
Following traditions that's been with us
For way far too long
Leading us straight into the grave

You'll never ever make me understand
I thought it was up to you and me
Or could we all let it be?
Instead we keep on dying with no questions asked
Living a life as it's supposed to be
And neither question nor disagree

We've set a path to follow and which we seem
To attend until its very end
Cause that's how things always been
For generations we've lived up to the standards of human life
Why do we keep holding on?

We neither question nor disagree..."
11,Grammatrain,Pain  (),TRSLZTS128F42534F2,1997,"I wish that I could say I am a perfect man
I wish sometimes that I would not be who I am
One day I decided I would think on this
Not knowing if faith and pain could co-exist

Could I ever on my own conceive
Of someone I did not know, but I need?
I must be made to be at peace and communion
'Cause there must be some place 
Somehow from where I have fallen

I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real

The inconsistency of what I say I should be
Compared to what I am in actuality
Leaves me in conclusion that I know the way
Though I am unable to always obey

Nothing in this world has satisfied
My soul's hunger for a deeper life
The weight of my misdeeds were crushing, blinding me
And I still live with pain inside but now I can see

And I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real

The pieces of my life are scattered on the floor
I stared at them till I could take no more

I do not deserve to be set free
Forgiveness is what I desperately need
If it wasn't for the perfect blood was shed
Would I not be dead inside but I live instead

I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real

I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real

I know my faith's still here
Believe through all my tears"
12,Don Huonot,Piikkilankaa,TRVAMGL128F425F3A1,1997,"Joo mulla on kai sua tosi ikävä

Sun ei tarvi jättää hyvästejä

Piikkilankaa punoo sydämeni ympärilleen

Joo mulla on kai sua liian ikävä
Enkä jaksa enää miettiä ja etsiä
Syitä siihen miksi enää harvoin
Tahdot mua nähdä, ja hiljalleen

14,Atari Teenage Riot,Redefine The Enemy,TRSCQRN128F932D6BA,1997,"Some feel the excitement of boredom...
Some don't...
But one day you will step outside
And you will feel the heat...
You hear the sirens of death and they sound afraid
We're back where we were ten years ago
And I'm feeling like I'm starting my old life from new
This is your last chance...
What's on your mind? 
Nothing I'm gonna die for nothing!
Nothing else that matters...
But what do you want from me? 
Anti-fashion seems to be fashion too by now
I don't need stupid policemen taking care about me
I don't need anyone!
I take it all by myself! myself!
Can you hear me? can you hear me? 
Tell me the truth you f**kface!
I'm gonna kill anyone for more!
Suck me up for a better reason and I'm gonna cut you short...
If only technology keeps moving you forward
And you're not prepared for the future
You become a naive child left in an information overload unit...
What's holding us back is time!
Worldleaders choose worldleaders...
Not us, not democracy, not a revolution!


Time to stop the germanization of the planet...
I've a fear of a white planet...
I redefine the enemy! redefine the enemy!
I broke the ice and I drowned
They want you dead but alive enough to function!
Everything gets out of control
But what do you do? tonight? 
Let's get back on the street - start living again...
Anything worth having is worth fighting for!
It's important that the future is on our side!
On my side...
White house and white snow...
The final moment has come...
It's all over!
It seems that you still have power in reserve...
But we are winning ...
Are you praying in your despair? 
I redefine the enemy! I've got to redefine the enemy!
Redefine the enemy...
Here I come! don't bother me!
There's nothing we can do!
It's not my style to just wait to be killed!
I'll wipe you all out!
Now is the chance... I'm covered in a blue shadow...
I fear no longer... I fear no longer...
Redefine the enemy! I redefine the enemy..."

I would love to forget
Restitution hasn't come quite yet

And with one accord
I keep pushin' forth
I stretch my heart
To heal some more

It used to be all I'd want
To learn
Was wisdom, trust and truth
But now all I really want
To learn
Is forgiveness for you

As my seasons change, I've now
Grown to know
When one's heart creates, one's soul
Doesn't owe

An' so I wash away
Stains of yesterday
Then tempt my heart
With love's display

It used to be all I'd want
To learn
Was wisdom, trust and truth
Now all I really want
To learn
Is forgiveness for you

It used to be all I'd want
To learn
Was wisdom, trust and truth
Now all I really want
To learn
Is forgiveness for you

It used to be all I'd want
To learn
Was wisdom, trust and truth

To learn

baby, baby, don’t you quit now

When tomorrow lips
Meet two coral lips
Then they kiss me, now and later
We can quarrel lips

I should turn you off
But you turn me on
So baby, baby don’t you quit now

Every kiss I take
Is a piece of cake
And to give me a sample
Was your first mistake
Cause I know when a little tastes like more
And now I want the whole darn
Bakery store

Take my pay from me
Christmas day from
Go anywhere you want
Except away from me
Quit tomorrow noon
Or nine o’clock
The fifth of June
But baby, don’t you quit now

I should turn you off

i'm a big procrastinator, i can always do it later. 
my friends all tell me that i got it made, 
it doesn't really matter. what i have to say, 
no one's fucking listening anyway. 
so until my days are done, or it's no longer any fun. 
i'm gonna bore you to death. life is overrated, 
i really want to be sedated. 
but i change the channel, and i'm watching days of our lives. 
it's so sophisticated, watching programs that i hated. 
but i guess it's better than working 9-5. 
the life that i'm living, it ain't really living. 
but i guess i could be working., so i'm free and clear. 
so my only friends tv will always keep my company, 
as i am watching soap operas downing cheetos and beer!!"

melding my consciousness with input so profound

Was ist der Sinn des Lebens?
Im Alltag bin ich nur Claude MC
Ich war gestreßt, sagte selten ich liebe dich,
Weil ich seit Methusalem von der Bühne träumte
Aber ich habe ein anderes Image
Du hast die Charaktere verwechselt. Schade.
Alles steht bei Umberto Eco
Ich brauche wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Lima, Oscar, Victor, Echo.
Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Als Kind spielte ich Fußball
Sie war der Ball, leider gab es einen Torwart
Wenn ich reintraf, jubelte sie
Mit ihrem langen Kleid war sie einzigartig
Vielleicht war ich zu brav
Ich hätte sie abends auf dem Hügel streicheln sollen
Ich stamme vom gesitteten Menschen ab
Gab ihr nur einen Abschiedskuß, bevor sie umgezogen ist
Alle meine Freunde fanden das schön
Ich brauche wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Lima. Oscar. Viktor. Echo.
Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Jetzt sieht man mich im Fernsehen
Ich bin bekannt, die Beziehungen sind verfälscht
Von der Moderne zum Mittelalter
Trotz meines Images bleibe ich vernünftig
Was ist der Sinn des Lebens?
Ist die schönste Schönheit nicht die einer Freundinn,
Frage ich mich oft. Umberto Eco. Notizbuch:
Die Seiten sprechen von Zeiten des Irrtums
Zu Hause betrachte ich die Wand
Bin reif genug, um sprechen zu dürfen
Claudia am Flow ohne Ego
Erwarte dich beim Helikopter. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Lima. Oscar. Viktor. Echo.
Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle."

Shadow of my life is hangin' over me
Broken man that I don't know
Will leave it standing, devil's dancing with my soul

Is in your hands, please
Look out tonite, there are
Too many danger outside!)

Hungry young boy, don't
Stay out too late
There may wait for U a
Costly rate
When darkness flows on a
Concrete street
It changes everything

How can you ask for some
Peace of mind
When they come out to play
Their special games
Ruled by evil without try
Somebody feeds on their
Weak souls to survive

LOOK OUT TONITE!

Angry young girl, you play
A dangerous game
You walk a real fine line
The dark alleys may jump
On you
Yo man, you don't know
What you do

It's all the mad luxury
With a voice of insanity
Please, don't try a half
Dead mind
Or there'll be no way to
Avoid the final blow
Yo man, I think you'd like
To stay alive!

LOOK OUT TONITE!

The shouts in the dark,
They never lie
You don't feel free, you
Don't feel right
Those who've grown up here
They see the hell of an
Immortal lie

You can act brave, but
Please don't try
Or you'll get killed by
The half dead mind
Though young blood's
Floowing, you'll need it
Still
Don't wanna see you being
A part of the final blow

The streets are covered
With red and blue
In some corridor a
Restless boogaloo
Wakes up the neighbours in
The middle of the night
The screams of fight move
Faster than light

44,Jesus Jones,They're Out There,TRZLKOV128F14621AE,1997,"He doesn't have a friend just some occupations
Staring at the sky or at computer screens
It gets you in the neck, all this looking skywards
But every marty knows that you suffer in belief

But if only you could see that things that he has seen!
'Cos he knows that he can tell you just what all this means

He knows, it's true that they're our there
He knows, it's true that they're our there
And there's very little faith left on this world

There's so much in the sky, it must be hiding something
He thinks that he's prepared and he's counting down the days

And if only you could see the things that he has seen!
'Cos he's sure that he could tell you just what all this means

It's so easy when we sneer
And mock the faith that he holds dear
But just like us he's chasing dreams

If you look hard enough then you'll see it clearly
There's something that we need always coming from the sky

And there's very little faith left on this world"

Pour implorer le ciel ensemble
En une seule et même église
Retrouver l'essentiel et faire
Que les silences se brisent

En haut des barricades
Les pieds et poings liés
Couvrant les fusillades
Chanter sans s'arrêter

Et faire s'unir nos voix
Autour du vin qui enivre
Chanter quelqu'un qui s'en va
Pour ne pas cesser de vivre
Pour quelqu'un qui s'en va
Pour ne pas cesser de vivre

Chanter celui qui vient au monde, l'aimer
Ne lui apprendre que l'amour
En ne formant qu'une même ronde
Chanter encore et toujours

Un nouveau jour vient d'éclore
Pouvoir encore s'en émerveiller
Chanter malgré tout, toujours plus fort
Je ne sais faire que chanter

Et faire s'unir nos voix

In a dream in a desert I was high as a kite
When I finally learned how to manage my states
I poured out my heart on the Buffalo Tapes

Give me one if by land
Give me two if by sea
Give me three if my cool friends are asking for me
Tell them I have gone fishing
And that no one knows where
'Cos daddy they hate me when I am not there
Oh they hate me when I am not there

Oh the tip of my pen has run totally dry
From hundreds of letters to you asking why
They sent invitations they hated my stay
They're shooting my wings while I'm flying away
They're shooting my wings away

And now I'm so happy that I've broken free
Daddy is it all that I hoped it would be
Will the rain make my river grow into a flow

cada vez que me miras
estoy perdida, no se que hacer

Confundida porque alguien me dijo
que despues del amor no hay amigos
tal vez llegue hasta el cielo contigo, o tal vez..........

No volvamos a vernos mas
aunque grite la soledad 
tal vez pierda al amigo que mas he querido 
o tal vez lo quiera mas

No podemos volver atras
y negar nuestra realidad
entre buenos amigos
tambien el cupido se asoma para flechar

Fue algo inevitable 
no hay que disimular
corazon inflamable basto una chispa para estallar
No me siento culpable
tengo que confesar 
que me gusto mirarte 
con otros ojos fue tan real

Confundida porque alguien me dijo 
que despues del amor no hay amigos
tal vez llegue hasta el cielo contigo o tal vez............

doch langsam kriegen wir raus
wie der Computer geht
wir reden in unser Handy
und hoffen dass uns dabei niemand sieht
Modefarbe orange
und was im Radio läuft
erweicht uns das Gehirn

Mit der Zeit fängt man an
sich für Countrymusik zu interessieren

Wir erinnern uns noch gern daran
als die Bösen noch böse warn
man brauchte nur auf die andere Seite zu gehen
damit man zu den Guten kam
Jetzt sehn sie alle nur noch wie Idioten aus
und hörn nicht auf sich zu blamiern

Mit dem Alter fängt man an
sich für Countrymusik zu interessieren

Ich leg die Platte auf
und mir kommt Zelten in den Sinn
Sie wengeln den Akkord
in einem fort
bis die Kühe nach Hause kommen

Solo

Und es interessiert uns einen Dreck
was draußen vor sich geht
denn es ist nur ein Werbegag
wenn sich die Arbeiterschaft erhebt
Und sie lachen in ihrem PR-Büro
Ich hör sie vor ihren Fenstern draußen
Und leise hört man Johnny Cash
in ihren Mittagspausen

Denn mit dem Alter fängt man an
sich für Countrymusik zu interessieren
Ja mit dem Alter fängt man an
sich für Countrymusik zu interessieren"

made it, made it 'Cuz her breasts

Well I don't wanna get bitter
I don't wanna turn cruel
I don't wanna get old before I have to

I could bitch, I could moan
Say I want to be left alone
But that's not really true,
Because I like my time with you

Till you rant and you rave
Wishing fat folks to their grave
But I feel sorry for them
You say they get what they deserve

Well I don't wanna get bitter
I don't wanna turn cruel
I don't wanna get old before I have to

I don't wanna get jaded
Petrified and weighted
I don't wanna get bitter like you
Like you, with the darts in your eyes
Like you, with disdain for mankind
I was charmed, now I wonder

Well I don't wanna get bitter
I don't wanna turn cruel
I don't wanna get old before I have to
So I'll smile with the rest
I'll wish everyone the best
And know the one who made it,
Made it cuz she was actually pretty good

Y escucho mis tacos marcando el andar
y el pulso del tiempo me hace pensar mejor
No hay más que: 
comer, reír, coger, dormir, hablar, 
decir, beber, soñar, jugar, ver, 
sentir dolor, sentir amor, 
trabajar, fumar, cantar, leer

The power of hatred, and a infernal burning mind of death. 
Blackened dreams are controlling me. 
I'm searching for their rightful meaning. 
Tomorrow nothing will remain but frozen images from my past. 
Sleeping... dreaming... ruling... 
But these are dreams, things in mind, reveries that thou shalt find. 
Blackened stars of a dying sky, is falling with me. 
Tormented by life's melancholy, eaten by a vast nothingness. 
I am alone, I sink and I rise, my dreams have created an everlasting death. 
Sleep to escape, dream to satisfy. 
Die to please, dreamdeath. 
Sleeping... dreaming... ruling... 
But these are dreams, things in mind, reveries that thou shalt find. 
Blackened stars of a dying sky, is falling with me. 
Tormented by life's melancholy, eaten by a vast nothingness.

Sleep to escape, dream to satisfy. 
Die to please, dreamdeath.

You sounded more familiar than that party was

I know every TV set that has them lit
They preach that I should save the world
They pray that I won't do a better job of it
Pray that I won't do a better job

Instead another voice said I was just too late
And just no good...

Calling Olson, calling Memphis
I am calling, can you hear this?

Ich bin der Ernst,
Ich bin der Ernst des Lebens
Aber alles, alles war vergebens

Sehen mich die Leute, dann grinsen sie schon
denn ich bin Ernst und das kommt davon

Ich kam in die Schule, der Lehrer sagte:
""Ernst, sei still, damit auch du was lernst""
Da bekam ich eine Depression und war nur gut in Religion

Auf meiner Kniescheibe sitzt ein blauer Vogel
Er sagt, er will sich ausruhen und dann weiterfliegen
Bis nach Barcelona oder Wien
Aber ich glaube, er will bei mir einzieh'n

Manchmal kommt es vor, dass mir die Tränen kommen
Dann würd ich auch mal gerne so ernst genommen
WIe der Bundeskanzler und die anderen Leute
Dann kommt mein Kater an meine Seite
Und er schnurrt und summt und sagt:
""Sing mit: Whiskas kommt von Wissen 
und Hitler kommt von Hit.

Auf meiner Kniescheibe sitzt ein blauer Vogel
Er sagt, er will sich ausruhen und dann weiterfliegen
Bis nach Barcelona oder Wien
Aber ich glaube, er wollte bei mir einzieh'n"

And in my bed, my lover, her hair was midnight black
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
And her black hair framed a happy heart-shaped face

And heavy-hooded eyes inside her black hair
Shined at me frome the depths of her hair of deepest black
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heart-shaped face

To kiss her milk-white throat, a dark curtain of black hair
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair
The smell of it is heavy. It is charged with life
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair

Full of all my whispered words, her black hair
And wet with tears and good-byes, her hair of deepest black
All my tears cried against her milk-white throat
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair

As deep as ink and black, black as the deepest sea
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow
Where her head and all its black hair did rest
Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West"

Known in your prophecy...

Sun... Son...
Sun it shifts, and brittleness subsides
To sleep... sleep away

One comes, the rain will always be
And things I am
Are things that should not be
They laughed at me but we never bothered

My friends and I
There were no others

Now it comes...
Bolt across the blue...
Shadows dance over the land...
Walls high, water deep
Brick and steel gathering speed
Guess it's just a feeling
...Guess it's just a feeling...

Rain may come
The rain may never be
In things you are
Are things I need to be
My friends were there but they never bothered

Now there's you and I an
There are no others

It's like when death becomes musical
...It's musical
It's like a death becomes musical
Musical

And it comes...
To make sure that he will never rise
And the groans from the bellies
Have never cried this hard
And the eyes of the wicked ones
Have never been full of dust
In the middle of the sea it waits...
...Closer...

Home, nor anywhere on Earth on that final day will anyone be apart
...One...schooled...together...
Towards the sea...
And we may drown, fly, fall from faith
...But the pain won't be realized
Because the emotions will hit as god should
And the mountains will offer no shelter
And the clouds will be no cover...
No matter where we run...

Don't die on me
Don't go away
When I need you here
In my need

The rain will come
The rain will always be
In things I am
Are things that have to be
My friends have come and I never bothered

Myself and I
There is no other

It's musical"

Congregation shall be burnt to the ground
For the fictions of insanity are holiest hypocrisy
Suffocating now without a sound

I hear you now from a thousand voids
Removed from time and timelessness
Where incarnations of simple nouns
Are beings each with golden crowns
Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping
Her dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Death will come as sudden
By the magik of our Coven
The ultimate horror is told
I stand alone and solemn
In the presence of Amon
I am sacrifice slowly going cold

Dreams ablazed with accursed fire
Of regret and eternal vigils
Hallowing nights, temptations lust
Compiled of satanic sigils

Out beneath the open night
A wanderer lies weeping
In some unspoken sadness
While her dream is oversleeping

Demand the dreams macabre

Power me up with wires! cut them thru my body!

Just watch me going mad!
Destroy each other to survive!

hurry to your door
Blessed is the blend that's racing
through my veins
And troubled is the mind that brings me
back to earth again

I want to call you baby
And you to take care of me
I want to call you baby, baby

Peel away the layers of
of coming consequence
I feel will follow should we fall
from innocence
Make it safe to lay in your loving arms
And let's pretend there's no one
here to hurt or harm

I want to call you baby
And you to take care of me
I want to call you baby, baby

Gather me up like a child in need
Watch over me while you rock me to sleep
When I'm alone all night in the dark

Talking in her sleep
She says 'You know I'll always be there'

Gulf Coast Highway, he worked the rails.
He worked the rice fields with their cool dark wells.
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico;
The only thing we've ever owned is this old house here by the road.

And when he dies, he says, he'll catch some blackbird's wing
And he will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring.

She walked through springtime when I was home.
The days were sweet, the nights were warm.
The seasons changed, the jobs would come the flowers fade;
This old house felt so alone when the work took me away.

And when she dies, she says, she'll catch some blackbird's wing
And she will fly away to Heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

Highway 90, the jobs are gone.
We tend our garden, we set the sun
This is the only place on earth bluebonnets grow.

And when we die, we say, we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven, come some sweet bluebonnet spring

I'm just one more thing to break
You wonder why
I wanna fall apart that way

Crack my reason
Wearing you pretty face
Dropped me a couple times
I come around anyway

Demolition by words
Wrecked all over town
Working for one break
Head down, passed out

You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to hide
Your friends don't know me
And they wonder where you go

Take it on another phone
Put-downs in code
I've got my own ring
You might not be alone

Leave me everywhere
Waking up on a floor
Locked in a nightclub
Breaking out the back door

You always tell me
I'm just one more thing to break"

Call upon immortals
Call upon the oldest ones to intercede

Rid us of our human waste
Cleanse our earthly lives
Make us one with darkness
Enlighten us to your ways

From churning worlds of mindlessness
Come screams unheard before
Haunting voices fill the room

Their source remaining undefined
Shadows cast from faceless beings
Lost for centuries

Lords of death, I summon you
Reside within our brains
Cast your spells upon our lives

So that we may receive
The gift of immortality
Bestowed on those who seek you"

But your memory.

And I wish that we could say
The things we want to say when we are far, so far
Away, dear.

I don't want anything without you.

But who will take care of me
When you are gone away."

Here are the young men,
Well where have they been?
We knocked on the doors
Of hell's darker chambers
Pushed to the limits
We dragged ourselves in
Watched from the wings as
The scenes were replaying
We saw ourselves now as
We never have seen
Portrayal of the traumas and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered
And never were freed
Where have they been (4)

Weary inside, now our heats
Lost forever
Can't replace the fear
Or the thrill of the chase
These rituals showed up the door
For our wanderings
Opened and shut, then slammed
In our face
Where have they been (4)"

It was here I'd lock the load
Denied for all his own 

Little baby,
Rattle sharp candy 
And I wanna stick around

The oldest national lottery
Enter Johnny-go-darkly
Come to spoil my party
Smell of feces lingers
Echo of light fingers
Cold comfort blankets
Steeped in creeping anger

Flatfoot comes poking
Compounding my misery
Grinding pestle and mortar
Adding insult to injury
If only this, if only that
If only in my guts
See my life before my eyes trampled underfoot

All the creeps go creepy crawling
Same thing every night
How can stealing candy from a baby seem alright?

Corvino, carrion crow
Skulking with his mobile
Slippery peat-bog eyes
Stick-on smiley smile
Small print like quicksand
Not a wooden leg to stand on
Sinking through my stomach
The ground beneath me gone

Free-fall, call Ophelia
Clutching at straw
Mixed with bloody feathers
From scruff of neck of crow
Johnny go! Johnny gone!
Too much drink in your tum-tum-tum
See this finger, see this thumb
See this fist and watch it come

So we walked         along,
though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me oh so strong about you
Then you gazed up at me and the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light in your eyes  in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
'Til that little bell began to ring in my head
In my head

But I tried        to run,
though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one,
or so I said
But my feelings for you
were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light in your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes
And I ran out before but I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes"

Will never be lonely
As long as I
Stick together
Like glue
Without you
I lie here on the couch
Thinking about potatoes and me
And I realize
Destined to be French fries
Me myself 
Me myself and I
My ship’s been tossed about
Have some decency
The only friends I’ve got left
Are my idiosyncrasies
Me myself
Me myself and I"

This life is filled with wonder
This life is full of days not spent
Oh I cannot help but ponder
What relevance that lends

Chorus
Oh but everything is comin' up roses
And when I'm pushing daisies ...
They'll want roses anyway
Oh and everything's comin' up roses
It's comin' up roses every day

I've got a heart bent on confusion
I'm punch drunk straight half the time
I'm feeling watered down and diluted
Still the weather's holdin' fine

Chorus

There's a piece of land in Kentucky
My grandfather worked one long hot day
Now it's a flatland blacktop strip mall
Still, I remember what he'd say

Chorus twice

Everyday ... everyday ... buy the dozen ... everyday"

Og venter på sin vennegjeng
De er litt forsinket men hva gjør vel det
Det er nok ikke lett å finne frem
(hei og hå og hei og hå)

Han har invitert for det meste folk han kjenner
En baker og en vegarbeider
En ungdommelig prest og en dyktig lege
Vidar er svært stolt av sine venner
(hei og hå og hei og hå)
Vidar er svært stolt av sine venner

Han gleder seg til å komme ut på fjorden
Ta en pils med sine venner under solen
Fortelle små historier fra livet
Han har en god en han har øvd seg på å si det

Bare de kan komme
Slik at de kan dra
Vidar lurer på hvor de blir av
(hei og hå og hei og hå)
Vidar lurer på hvor de blir av

Kanskje baker'n har en kake i ovnen
Og noe er i veien med vegarbeider'n
Kanskje presten måtte bistå en begravelse
Og legen sliter med en dårlig helse
(hei og hå og hei og hå)
Legen sliter med en dårlig helse

Vidar ser på klokken: to timer nå
Og ennå ingen vennegjeng
De sa de skulle komme - alle som en
Tenker Vidar når han kaster fortøyningen
(hei og hå og hei og hå)
Vidar han kaster fortøyningen

Nok til for mange blir for mye for en
Vidar begynner å bli ør av all pilsen
Jeg får vel prøve å kose meg når jeg først er her
Tenker Vidar og går med stor fart på et skjæær

Det er legen som stiller diagnosen
Og presten bistår i begravelsen
Baker'n baker kake
Og vegarbeider'n er for alle aller mest i veien
(hei og hå og hei og hå)
Vegarbeider'n er mest i veien

Slike venner er det fint å ha
De glimrer med sitt fravær avtalte kvelder
Men stiller opp når det virkelig gjelder
Når det gjelder venner for livet"

she'd even pop a zit on my back

after i'd had a few
she caught me red handed
and said ""we're through""
boo-hoo
now she got a new boyfriend
it nearly gave me a heart attack
cause who's gonna pop this zit on my back?
well I got a pimple and I don't know why
it keeps growin' in the same place
I can't reach it with my left or right hand
I wish it was on my face
it's four days old and it hurts so bad
but it's ready for a squeeze
won't somebody pop it for me please?
i'll give you ten dollars
if you're a girl in this lonely world
and you're lookin' for a guy
i'll never cheat again, I promise
that's no lie
there's only one thing I ask of you,
could we name our first child zach?

he played in a band he never got out of breath
he missed no crazy things his life was like his death
we could not believe why didn't he come back
a preacher spoke of love and hope we all were dressed in black

Was it the day the sparrows flew away
was it the day we flew away
was it the day the sparrows flew away
was it the day we had to pay

A girl was going out with one of our floor
until she felt in love with Rob who smoked next door
times were getting harder I stood between the lines
the wheel of time was turning we didn't recognize
from this day on our common room got quite
no more peace of laughter were roaring through the night
a tear could have been love a smile could have been hate
we were sitting on our rooms to wait on our fate

none of blythe power used our shower
a citizen fish smoked a few spliffes
then the letter was short by the land lord no...

Then smack niggaz when they don't feel Keith's right direction
Put niggaz in fear, the bullets in they head section
Pick up drug dollars, leave rings around niggaz collars
Front me cash, you catch them bodies, put em in a stash
Never laugh at you, explain plans, what to do
Machine guns on tour, pajama for your soft crew
Don't step to me with shit the candle wax is gettin lit
I'm solo now, and still money I have to fuckin split
Business ain't straight in glamour world, fuckin hellgate
All these things I been through, your skull deserves a metal plates
Not the platinum plaque, just gun staples in your back
Hung from a tree with rusty nails in your rectum crack

You might as well bite Kane, Rakim, study G. Rap

Throw the pistols away, and hide the shit in the grass now

Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I’m lyin’
And when the lights are low - and it’s time to go
That’s when I need your love so bad

So why don’t you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin’ me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don’t want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright

Just as soon as my pocket book was empty
Not a friend on earth to be found

She had a wine glass in her hand
She was drinking down her troubles
With a low-down sorry man

Oh, my daddy taught me a-plenty, good people
My mama, she taught me more
If I didn't quit my rowdy ways
Have trouble at my door

I wrote my woman a letter, good people
I told her I's in jail
She wrote me back an answer
Saying ""Honey, I'm a-coming to go your bail""

All around this old jailhouse is haunted, good people
Forty dollars won't pay my fine
Corn whisky has surrounded my body, poor boy
Pretty women is a-troubling my mind

Give me corn bread when I'm hungry, good people
Corn whiskey when I'm dry
Pretty women a-standing around me
Sweet heaven when I die

If I'd a-listened to my mama, good people
I wouldn't have been here today
But a-drinking and a-shooting and a-gambling
At home I cannot stay

Go dig a hole in the meadow, good people
Go did a hole in the ground
Come around all you good people
And see this poor rounder go down

When I am dead and buried
My pale face turned to the sun
You can come around and mourn, little woman
And think the way you have done"

The drama and swagger of fools.
Sacrifice beauty once, 
to chase after their parade.

Through my troubles and stuff

Is that I think, i think too much

My goal was then drafted
The seduction was crafted
I executed my strategy
But you never would come to me
Every course had been taken
So my hope was forsaken
But when ambition was thrown away
It was then that you came my way

It's causing me trouble
It's costing me double

And win a love I don't deserve out on the ice tonight
Teach me the bluest song you know
The moon ain't comin' up and I swear to God tonight it feels like snow

I'm glad we got your hands warm so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
The world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
Maybe catch a new wave, feels right, feels right

So we ride whales and drag-race time
And knock the fires from the traces of trilobyte hives
You sleep like God inside her womb
And you see clearly too 
the silicon wasteland they left inside my mind

I'm glad we got your hands warm so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
The world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
Maybe catch a new wave

We lost the road now
Inject the charms
And we care for all of ours
We stand in rows now
Transfer alarms

Just like the Inuit with the promise song to come down and see
Your solvents frozen here on the petal rung
Is all we have to see enlarged inside as we espy the warming sea
Your breath diffused and never realized aside from where the panicked hide
And I, just a subtle lift provider on the other side"

For the love you could only provide

What am I gonna do, who's gonna love me?
If you don't love me like you say you'll do
Baby, why couldn't you be true?
'Cause I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
What am I gonna do?
I need your lovin' and your kisses too

I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
I, I miss you, baby, girl, what am I gonna do?
I ain't got you, you know I miss you, baby
I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

You can see it all in my walk
You can tell by the way I talk
I miss you, baby, no sense denyin'
I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

I'll tell the whole wide world
I can't live without you, I miss you, baby
No matter who you're with tonight
If you come back, I'll treat you right

I said I miss you, baby
I miss you, baby, longin' for you"
144,Platero Y Tu,Alucinante,TRXMAKH128F423CBCF,1997,"No sé si es cierto lo que he visto
O es el efecto de una droga
¡Qué bien! Hoy todo es tan distinto
parece que el mundo funciona.
La gente ya no siente miedo
Las sombras tienen mil colores
El viento barre los problemas
Y en las pistolas crecen flores.
Y es que es tan alucinante
Que hace días que no duermo
Por si acaso al despertarme
Veo que todo ha sido un sueño.
Por qué nacemos indefensos
Nos dan un nudo en el ombligo
Luego nos quitan nuestros sueños
Y nos confunden el camino.
Maldigo a todos esos locos
Que quieren gobernar la vida
Sin las palabras del poeta
Y sin las manos del artista.
Y es que es tan alucinante..."
145,The Subdudes,He's Got You On His Mind,TRPMOJQ128F428B5DD,1997,"This love for you it cannot hide
This love is deep deep inside
He's got you on his mind.
To think about it would wreck his mind
to let it go would free his soul
but he's got you he's got you on his mind
But he's not worried, no he's not worried
and he's not wonderin', no he's not wonderin'
Lord he's not worried, no he s not worried
He's got you got you he's got you on his mind
I see you as an island filled with gold
for your love I tried but I couldn't hold.
But he's got you got you he's got you on his mind
To think about it Lord would wreck his mind
and to let it go would free his soul
but he's got you got you he's got you on his mind
But he's not worried, no he's not worried
and he s not wonderin', no he s not wonderin'
Lord he s not worried, no he s not worried
He's got you got you he's got you on his mind"
