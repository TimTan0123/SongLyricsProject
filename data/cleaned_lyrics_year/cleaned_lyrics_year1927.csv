0,Bessie Smith,After You've Gone,TRBSAFI128F4249FBD,1927,"Now listen honey while I say
How can you tell me that you're going away?
Don't say that we must part
Don't break my achin' heart

You know I love you true for many years
Love you night and day
How can you leave me
Can't you see my tears?
So listen while I say

After you've gone
And left me cryin'
After you've gone
There's no denyin'
You'll feel blue
You'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal
You ever had

There'll come a time
Now don't forget it
There'll come a time
When you'll regret it
Someday
When you grow lonely
Your heat will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone
After you've gone away

After you've gone
Left me cryin'
After you've gone
There's no denyin'
You'll feel blue
You'll feel sad
You'll miss the best pal
You ever had

There'll come a time
Now don't forget it
There'll come a time
When you'll regret it
Someday
When you grow lonely
Your heat will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone
After you've gone away"
1,Blind Blake,That Will Never Happen No More,TRUHHCX12903CE6903,1927,"I met a girl at the cabaret
Said pretty papa I'm goin' your way
Her man know what it all about
Waiting at home just to throw me out
Broke my nose split my chin
Don't let me catch you here again
He whipped me from the kitchen back to the door
He beat me with a chair till my head got sore

That'll never happen no more
That'll never happen no more

The wind in Chicago winter and fall
It caused me to wear my overalls
Flat broke it was my fault
Been used to eating pork chops I'm eating salt
I met a woman in a big mink fur
Big fat mouth me followed her
She pulled a gun and she take my dough
I didn't eat my heart out and I didn't get sore

That'll never happen no more
That'll never happen no more"
2,Blind Blake,He's In The Jailhouse Now,TROOEIN128F92E3A50,1927,"Remember last election
Everybody was in action
Tryin' to find themselves a president
There was a man named Lawson
From New York down to Boston
Representing the colored people we had sent

My brother was a voter
Also a great promoter
Goin' round givin' advice
They'd go to the poll and vote
Instead of voting once he voted twice

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
We got him down town in jail
No one to go his bail
He's in the jailhouse now"

The blues overtake me and tears come rollin' down

The woman I love, she must be out of town
Woman I love, man, she's out of town
She left me this mornin' with her face in a terrible frown

Oh, Lordy, how the sun do shine
Oh, Lordy, how the sun do shine
And I can't get from Charleston, with that brownskin girl of mine

They're barkin' in the mornin', they're barkin' late at night
They're barkin' in the morning, they're barkin' late at night
My weary dogs bark so loud, it'll take a good man's appetite

They wake me every mornin', Lordy, with the risin' sun
They wakes me in the mornin', oh, Lordy, with the risin' sun
My weary dogs don't leave me, until my day's work is done

Me and my weary dogs started, we started out of Jackson Park
When me and my weary dogs started, we started out of Jackson Park
And it's music to any good man's ears, for to hear my weary dogs bark

I can tell when it's rainin', honey, I know when the sun gon' shine
I can tell when it's raining, sugar, I know when the sun gon' shine
Because my weary dogs keep me posted all the time

Weary dogs in my young days, weary dogs is all I crave
Weary dogs in my young days, weary dogs is all I crave
Sometime I thinks weary dogs is goin' to carry me to my grave

I'm gonna stop at a place I haven't ever been before

I ain't got no wife, I ain't got no child at school
I ain't got no wife, and I ain't got no child at school
Reason I'm hangin' around here, man, I'm stickin' here dry long so

If you've got a sweet woman, you better love her while you can
If you've got a sweet woman, you better love her while you can
For your heart'll strike sorrow when I come back to town again

I lied down last night, rolled from side to side
I lied down last night, rolled from side to side
Sugar, the blues ain't on me but things ain't goin' on right

I drink so much whiskey, stagger all in my sleep
I drink so much whiskey, I stagger all in my sleep
Well, that brown 'cross town, I declare she is worryin' me

Believe I'll sing this song, and I ain't gonna sing no more

I said I'm broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too
Mama, if I clean up, can I go home with you?

I'm motherless, fatherless, sister and brotherless too
I said I'm motherless, fatherless, sister and brotherless too
Reason I've tried so hard to make this trip with you

You miss me woman, count the days I'm gone
You miss me woman, count the days I'm gone
I'm goin' away to build me a railroad of my own

I feel like jumpin' through a keyhole in your door
I said I feel like jumpin' through the keyhole in your door
If you jump this time, baby, you won't jump no more

I believe my good gal have found my black cat bone
I said I believe my baby have found my black cat bone
I can leave Sunday mornin', Monday mornin' I'm slippin' 'round home

I wanna show you women what careless love have done
I wanna show you women what careless love have done
Caused a man like me, steal away from home

Girl if you don't want me, why don't you let me know?
I said, if you don't want me, mama let me know
So I can leave at once and hunt me somewhere else to go"
13,Furry Lewis,Falling Down Blues,TRTIPKQ128F933E6A0,1927,"I got the blues so bad it hurts my feet to walk
Got the blues so bad it hurts my feet to walk
I wouldn't hate it so bad but it hurt my tongue to talk

Mama I feel like jumping through the keyhole in your door
I feel like jumping through the keyhole in your door
I can jump so easy your man will never know

Some people said worried blues ain't tough
Some people said the worried blues ain't tough
But if they don't kill you handle you mighty rough

Hitch up my buggy, please saddle up my black mare
Hitch up my buggy, saddle up my black mare
I'm going to find my woman on the road somewhere

She caught the rumbling, I caught the falling down
She caught the rumbling, I caught the falling down
If I never see her, I never turn around

She caught the rumbling, Lord I caught the falling down
She caught the rumbling, I caught the falling down
I never see her I never turn around"
14,Hoagy Carmichael,Stardust,TRFADTM12903CB158C,1927,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago, and now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain."
15,Lucille Bogan,Coffee Grindin' Blues,TRJXTGU128F9359B68,1927,"Ain't nobody, it ain't nobody

I drink so much coffee, I grind it in my sleep
And when it get like that, you know it can't be beat

It's so doggone good that it made me bite my tongue
It's so doggone good it made me bite my tongue
Will keep it for my daddy, ain't gonna give nobody none

I ain't ever loved it this-a way before
I ain't ever loved it this-a way before
And I hope the Lord that I won't love it any more

I've got so now that I can't control my mind
I've got so now that I can't control my mind
I go to bed blue and I get up cryin'

It's so doggone good that it made me talk out of my head
It's so doggone good it made me talk out of my head
And it's better to me than any that I have ever had

Now I grind my coffee, at the 2 and 3 dollars a pound
I grind my coffee, at the 2 and 3 dollars a pound
And it ain't no mo' cheap like mine in town

It's so doggone good until it'll make you bite your tongue
It's so doggone good that it'll make you bite your tongue

You must bring me a job or money from anywhere
'Cause I can get your kind of lovin' in the street just anywhere

You come home every day lookin' for your stew and beans
You come home every day lookin' for your stew and beans
And you have got more nerve than any pot hound1 I've ever seen

Now you take your money, you have your fun
You don't have nothin', when house rent come
And I'm thru, cookin' your stew and beans
And you can eat more neck bones that any man I've ever seen

Now if you want me baby, you got to make your purse show down
If you want me baby make your purse show down
And you got to put your money down where I got mine

Now you're layin' up in my bed, between my two white sheets
I can't see and smell nothin', but your doggone feet
And I'm thru, tryin' to make a man of you
And if you can't bring a job, don't you look for your daily stew

I worked hard from Monday until late Saturday night
And you're a dirty mistreater, you ain't treatin' me right
And I'm thru, cookin' your stew and beans

Ah, boys, I'm gonna show you the best
Ma Rainey's gonna show you her black bottom

Way down south in Alabamy
I got a friend, they call dancin' Sammy
Who's crazy about all the latest dances
Black bottom stomps and the Jew baby prances

The other night at a swell affair
Soon as the boys found out that I was there
They said, ""Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret""
Where that band you ought to hear me say""

I want to see that dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance

Come on and show me your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

I want to see the dance you call the black bottom

Grandpa told my grandma, I heard him say
Get up and show your old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance

Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom
They stay to see that dance
Wait until you see me do my big black bottom
I'll put you in a trance

There'll be a little girl
Just to drive away the blues
Bright Eyes, don't cry, Bright Eyes, good-bye
Listen to my song
I'll come marching to you, and fighting, too
And it's Bright Eyes, good-bye to you

I'll come marching to you, and fighting, too
And it's Bright Eyes, good-bye to you"
21,Papa Charlie Jackson,Blue Monday Morning Blues,TROOSYC128F4280D13,1927,"Did you ever have a bad luck woman on your trail?
Did you ever have a bad luck woman on your trail?
Always keeps you broke, always keeps you in jail

I used to be happy, had good luck all the time
I used to be happy, had good luck all the time
But soon as I got this woman, that was all I can call mine

My bad luck woman is a jinx and a worry too
My bad luck woman is a jinx and a worry too
I can't get rid of her no matter what I do

I tried to make her quit me by callin' another woman's name
I tried to make her quit me by callin' another woman's name
She said, ""That is all right, he love me just the same""

She keeps a rabbit's foot in her hand at night when she goes to sleep
She keeps a rabbit's foot in her hand at night when she goes to sleep
She keeps it with her, so I won't make no midnight creep

My bad luck woman keeps me feelin' blue
My bad luck woman keeps me feelin' blue
I can't get rid of her, she sticks to me like glue"

And you oughta done sewed them pants"
