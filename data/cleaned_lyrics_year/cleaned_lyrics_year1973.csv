0,Fats Waller,I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter,TRFYPZC12903CD12AA,1973,"I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say ""I hope you're feeling better""
And close ""with love"" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

Gonna smile and say ""I hope you're feeling better""
And close ""with love"" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe, make believe, make believe it came from you"

Ooh, my soul
Hey kid, boogie, too, did ya?
Hey, shout, summertime blues
Jump up and down in my blue suede shoes
Hey, kid, rock 'n' roll, rock on

And where do we go from here?
Which is a way that's clear?
Still looking for that blue jean baby queen
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
See her shake on the movie screen, Jimmy Dean

2,Nazareth,Razamanaz,TRFDEVW12903CD9988,1973,"We've got to get it together
You bring the wine, we'll bring the weather
We haven't come to be clever
Let's make it now 'cause this could be never
We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance.

We won't allow you a second to slow down

You as the taker, and we as the giver
We're gonna razamataz ya tonight
We're gonna razamanaz ya all night
Razamataz, razamataz, up on your feet
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance.

3,Eric Clapton,Little Wing,TRPOCPJ128E079394D,1973,"Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running 'round.
Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales,
That's all she ever thinks about.

When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free.
Said, ""It's all right, take anything you want,
Anything you want, anything.""

Well she's walking through the clouds

4,Fairport Convention,The Hexhamshire Lass,TROJYPF128E078FCDF,1973,"Away with the buff and the blue
And away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Her father loves her well, her mother loves her dearer
I love them better than them both but, man, I can't get near her
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
If only I could be lying there aside her
While I must bide here, my arms'll be denied her
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Her skin is like the silk and her hair is like the silver
Her breasts are deep and cool, they'll warm when I get near her
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Ah, this love of mine, oh, this love, I am weary
Sleep I can't get none for thinking of my dearie
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Away with the ?gilded? shield and away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Away with the buff and the blue
Away with the cap and feather
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire
Off with the  . . .  and over the moss and the mire
I want to see my lass who lives in Hexhamshire"
5,Tanya Tucker,Would You Lay With Me (In A Field Of Stone),TRIAVTH128F426FFC5,1973,"Would you lay with me
In a field of stone
If my needs were strong
Would you lay with me

Should my lips grow dry
Would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour
If my lips were dry

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hands
If I give myself to you

Will you bathe with me 
In the stream of life
When the moon is full
Will you bathe with me

Will you still love me
When I'm down and out
In my time of trial
Will you stand by me

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dieing hands
If I give myself to you

Would you lay with me
In a field of stone
Should my lips grow dry
Would you wet them dear
Would you bathe with me
In the stream of life
Would you still love me
When I'm down and out"

9,Paul McCartney / Wings,My Love,TROFVDQ12903CFB792,1973,"And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
It's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good
Whoa whoa-whoa whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa

And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love

10,The Fleetwoods,(He's) The Great Imposter,TRLKUYF128F427CC16,1973,"Well, I went and lost her
To the great imposter
I stood and watched her fall
Couldn't help her at all

Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

Don't she know he's on a stage
It's not real, it's just a play
And he's playing a part
That is soon to break her heart

Oh, can't she see tomorrow's misery?
Soon she'll learn her fate but it will be too late
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

Poetry, so sweet, has her at his feet
She thinks she's the one but he has just begun
All her friends they just watch her
For they know the great imposter

And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster
For they know the great imposter
And she's soon to join the roster"
11,Billy Joel,The Ballad Of Billy The Kid,TRGPDTS128F92EA514,1973,"From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande

Well, he started with a bank in Colorado
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
And the word spread of Billy the Kid

Well he never travelled heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
And he never had a home
But the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they love to tell
'Bout when Billy the Kid came to town

Well, one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said, ""String 'im up for what he did.""
And the cowboys and their kin
Like the sea came pourin' in
To watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid

Well he never travel'ed heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
Well he never had a sweetheart
But he finally found a home
Underneath the Boot Hill grave that bears his name

From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande"
12,Marie Osmond,Paper Roses,TRTZIBX128F9326F35,1973,"I realized the way your eyes deceived me
with tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of
Paper Roses
Paper Roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation,
Like you imitation love for me
I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in your heart
Paper Roses
Paper Roses
Oh how real those roses seem to be
But they're only imitation like you imitation love for me"
13,Demis Roussos,My Friend The Wind,TRTTCHQ128F1477601,1973,"My friend the wind will come from the hills 
When dawn will rise, he'll wake me again 
My friend the wind will tell me a secret 
He shares with me, he shares with me 

My friend the wind will come from the north 
With words of love, she whispered for me 
My friend the wind will say she loves me 
And me alone, and me alone 

I'll hear her voice and the words 
That he brings from Helenimou 
Sweet as a kiss are the songs of Aghapimou 
Soft as the dew is the touch of Manoulamou 
Oh oh oh 

We'll share a dream where I'm never away from Helenimou 
Blue are the days like the eyes of Aghapimou 
Far from the world will I live with Manoulamou 
Oh oh oh 

My friend the wind go back to the hills 
And tell my love a day will soon come 
Oh friendly wind you tell her a secret 
You know so well, oh you know so well 

I'll hear her voice and the words 
That he brings from Helenimou 
Sweet as a kiss are the songs of Aghapimou 
Soft as the dew is the touch of Manoulamou 
Oh oh oh

14,Michael Stanley,Rosewood Bitters,TRJDIPG128F4267C02,1973,"Too long on the road, my friend
Too long between rides
Too long between homes again
Too long without someone by my side

And Lord, there's something 'bout a sad song
that helps to ease the pain...
Here I am, Lord, just singing up a storm
and I'm all alone again...

Too much going down today
just can't take it in
Too much running 'round today
can't tell you where I've been

Seems that just like singing in the only thing to do
only thing to help me pass the time
Songs are just like ladies--can't forget them when you're through
and they're always on your mind...

(CHORUS:)
And the rosewood bitters
Help me meet the sunshine in the morning
And the rosewood bitters
Help me through the night
When I feel blue

Too few stop to pass the time
Guess that's how it goes
So sure that there's much more than this
when really no one knows

And easing into midnight
as the bitters pass around
crying in my beer
Singing someone else's troubles
help to ease your own
Goodnight, Irene, my dear...

(CHORUS)"

My mind reels back to those days in the city 
When early in the morning take a trip, it's so pretty 
I could never understand why it wasn't so grand 

I got a hankerin' for a wind wave 
I got it through and through 
I got a hankerin' for somethin' home made 
It's got to be brand new 

Early in the morning when the sun comes up 
I'm gonna grab a fishin' pole and a sleepin' bag roll 
Head out for the land of the dumb but the pretty 
I won't stay long but you never know

17,Gregg Allman,Queen Of Hearts,TRKZTAU128F42137C7,1973,"Once I was glad,
Always happy never sad,
And every day
Felt like Sunday
And although things were slow
Never seemed to have no dough
Somehow, I never once got lonely
Ya' see the fact is more or less
You're gamblin' with your own happiness
And most all your would-be friends
Turn out so phony

Oh but times they change
And I'm through the rains
And I'm seein' the Queen of Hearts
Don't know where to start
Or how to stop

And after things have come and gone
Left me feelin'
That I've done so wrong
Oh, I've spent so much time
Feelin' guilty
And as I watch you sit across the room
Beautiful as the flowers bloom
Living it just one day
Oh brother you're gonna come back
To find me gone

I love you Queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start
Where now baby
Tell me where to start

And after all that we've been through
I find that when I think of you
A warm soft wind runs
Through and through
And in my heart
There's only you
And I will always keep on trying
To gather this strange peace of mind
Without it there'd be
Lonely me and
Oh darlin' lonely you

I love you Queen of Hearts
Don't tell me when to stop
Tell me when to start

I love you queen of Hearts
Tell me not to stop
Just tell me where
To start"

Stars aligned and the webs were spun
I coulda sworn I heard my spirit soarin'
Guess I'm always chasin' the sun
Hopin' we will soon be one
Until it turns around to me, then I try to run...
On phosphorous wings the phoenix floated
The fires froze and the sea was hushed
And when I tried to speak, the sun imploded
And the war will wage in my guts
Till the Devil bites the dust,
I never say him losin' a race, but I think he must...
The great storm raged and the power kept growin'
Dragons rose from the land below
And even now I wonder where I'm goin'
Ever since a long time ago
I've tried to let my feelings show
I'd like to think I'm bein' sincere, but I'll never nnow..."

We have never got the time

Now, don't be nervous
If I seem upset	
I can handle it and yet

I'd rather be alone with you

Walk a little faster
I got your mama on the phone
What a sense of timing
When you need to be alone

Hang a sign out
Telling everyone
We'll be gone for quite awhile

Close the door, don't slam it
Let me be alone a while

Whatever you do I love you
No matter what you do I love you
And I want to run out after you

If you will take good care of me
I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

You will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

Hours later
I hear the key in the front door
We look each other in the eye
A timid sorry pair

There's a little more conversation
A little more conversation
A battle's lost and a war is won
I think we've cleared the air

You will take good care of me
I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

If you will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker

You will take good care of me
Then I'll be your caretaker
You'll be the maker of the peace

You'll be the maker of the peace
I'll be the peacemaker"

And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Oh I need to have the strength that flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear, when love can see me through

Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion

So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion

To rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby
Rock the boat, ooh

Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self
Rock the boat, rock on with yo bad self

The mention of your name
And all my love for you
Burst into flame

I tried so hard
To let you go, but look
How I still tremble at your name
That's all it took

That's all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share.
I tell my friends I'm happy,
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took.

That s all it took to make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker line and hook
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took.
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took."

Bullet holes and scars between the spaces

Thunder from the barrel of his gun

There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

Hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one

Hiding away from love
How could I be so sure
Lately I wonder about it more and more

So I think that it's just about time
That I opened up my eyes
Then if I see love come my way
I wont let it pass me by

Come on love, come on in
Come on let my life begin
I've waited much to long to see your face

Come on love, now is the time
To show that you're a friend of mine
As sure as there's a sky above
You can be the girl I've been dreaming of
Come on love

There was a time before
When I knew what love could be


Something changed as you walked away from me
So I made myself a world that would let nobody in
Cause it's only now that I see what a fool I've been

So love, I'm calling on you
To do what only love can do
Any plans that I had for one
Can easily be made for two

Come on love, come on in
Come on let my life begin
I've waited much to long to see your face

Come on love, now is the time
To show that you're a friend of mine
As sure as there's a sky above

Come on love come on now

Maybe you think, a lot like me
Of those who live beside the sea
Who feel so free, so I surmise
With their comfortable* homes and wives  
Who end up drinking tea together
In the afternoon of their lives.

They build their homes upon the seashore
The quicksand castles of their dreams
Yet take no notice of the North wind
Which tears their buildings at the seams.

In their dismay and blind confusion
The weeping widows clutch their shawls
While as the sea mist ever deepens
The sailors hear the sirens' calls.

And in the maelstrom sea which follows
The lifeboat sinks without a trace
And yet there still remain survivors
To bear the shame of their disgrace.

Last night I lay in bed and held myself
Trying to remember how it once was with you
How your hands were softer.

Yesterday I found myself staring into space
Rather like the sailor in my own home surroundings
I'm not sure I know me.

If you were me, what would you do ?
Don't tell me I don't need you to
It won't help me now.

If you were me, what would you do ?
Don't tell me I don't need you to

Woke up this morning,
My dog was dead.
Someone disliked him
And shot him through the head.

Woke up this morning,
My cat had died.
I know I'll miss her,
Sat down and cried.

Came home this evening,
My hog was gone.
People here don't like me,
I think I'll soon move on.

Now somethings happened
That would make a saint frown.
I turned my back and
My house burned down."

Down around San Antone

'Round about their home
The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came

Well, you're talking 'bout Ch-China Grove, whoa ho ho
Whoa, ho, China Grove 

Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down 
They say that the Father's insane
And dear Missus Perkin's a game

We're talkin' 'bout Ch-China Grove, whoa ho ho
Whoa, ho, China Grove 

But every day there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an Oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies with their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night 
And though it's a part of the Lone Star State
The people don't seem to care
They'll just keep on lookin' to the east 

A-talkin' 'bout Ch-China Grove, whoa ho ho
Whoa, ho, China Grove"

Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away

My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My, my high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words

There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As a smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doing here?""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da

Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say 
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away. 
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you were born to do'? 
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you. 
Love, love boy... 
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night. 

Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh 
Cos you've been a saving grace to me 
And I'd hate to face a day without you around 
My life would be without sound 

Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday 
Cos you taste to me as good as God made honey taste babe 
And the sky all glistens with gold 
When you're talking to me 
And the whirling wind turns to song 
Why it sets my soul free

I'm the son and you're the daughter

who gets a little stoned beside the wayside.

Well, there's one thing to try
everybody knows
music gets you high
everybody grows
and so it goes.

You're the lips that make the laughter
you're the sunshine in the snow
shining out on everything you feel
you're the bird that dropped the berry
on the island far below
finding out that everything is real.

Well, there's one thing to try
everybody knows
music gets you high
everybody grows
and so it goes.

We are loved and we are lonely
we are many, we are few.
make it out of love and build a dream
we are hoboes, we are holy
we are me and we are you,

Lines on my head from that one thing she said 
She spoke of strangers that don't sleep two a bed 
Kept on trying, buying time,not waiting on fate 
I somehow got the feeling that I opened my eyes too late 
I saw where you came from 
Called out your name 
But there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep 
I made you my wife but I don't need that 
Lines on my face,while I laugh lest I cry 
Speed city dirt and gritty waving me goodbye 
So many people,my family of friends 
Trying so hard to make me smile untill this heartache mends 
I saw where you came from 
called out your name 
but there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep 
I made you my wife but I don't need that 
Ice in her eyes,frozen tears would never be a surprise 
You can't erase a dream you can only wake me up 
My mind is turning slower,never to accept defeat
It don't matter where I live I still got a house to heat

called out your name

Know they play much better when the sun goes down
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene
Your hands are dirty but your scent is clean
Bam goes the blue, lock away your cue
The pool hall king is hustlin' you
Bam goes the 8-ball, didn't see it spin at all
This kid can play, oh yeah

Bam goes the brown, ooh another one down
Know they play much better when the sun goes down
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene
Your hands are dirty, your scent is clean
Damn the pink, one more to sink
Gonna beat you someday 'cause you're makin' me sick
Down on the black, at the back of the pack
Aw, you nearly missed, you ain't so hot

'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you""

Ask one favor from you""

Gimme three steps towards the door?

Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou

And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

I've had my share of guys

Lui prendeva a calci l'acqua
Un velo rosso moriva
Danzando, ai suoi piedi.

Il buio di rosso macchiava
Il cielo e sull'asfalto vegliava
Una finestra di ferro
Una croce di legno, per un uomo solo.

E tu che solo cammini sull'acqua
Sogni inseguendo
Misterioso il tuo viso
Per vetrine smeraldo
In un boulevard a Saint-Germaine.

Il San Bernardo fresco di latte
Regala parole in un cofanetto da re
In cambio di altre, altre parole
In cambio del solito panino del giorno.

E il sole ci stava osservando
Dall'altro capo dell'autostrada
Mentre tu, oratore, parlavi.

Invito tutta la gente
A mangiare collane
E succhio al sole mio amico
L'ultimo caldo respiro.

Canto e gioco con gli occhi
E ho di fronte la strada
Che mi parla e mi ricorda
Le pietre rimosse nella vendemmia.

E il vino che ho raccolto
Oggi io l'offro a mia madre
Che un giorno da una finestra di sole
Ha offerto me al mondo.

E il sole ci stava osservando

He locked me up last fall
I taught her daughter how to do the boogie
Now I can't go back at all

They call me the boogie man

Down on the county line
I went down there to do some boogie
And I wound up down in town

In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know everything's alright

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard days work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile waiting in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

And I swam in a swimming pool
Salt my wounds, chlorined my eyes
I'm a self-destructive fool

This summer I did the back stroke
And you know that that's not all
I did the breast stroke, the butterfly
And the old Australian crawl
The old Australian crawl

This summer I swam in a public place
And a reservoir to boot
At the latter I was informal
At the former I wore my suit
I wore my swimming suit

Oh, this summer I did swan dives
And jack-knives for you all
And once when you weren't looking
I did a cannon-ball
I did a cannon-ball

Across the desert of despair
I know I'll get there one day

How times have changed
I better re-arrange it everything
But it can't change the love I bring
When I get back home to you
I am the same
It's just a game that I chose to play
But remember I can lose
As fast as I won one day


I still remember the hole in the wall
Where we all sat though
You said we'd fall
The dusty yard and
The broken down barn
Where you and me
Used to share a yarn
But it's gone now

But didn't I tell ya

Gonna be alright

And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddamit you're all gonna die

How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you

What if I fall?

Soaring aloft and far below
Lying on stony ground, the fragments

Counting the cost in money only

Weighing the words one tries to use
Nevertheless communication

You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

Well, I knew what I was doing, I was running away,
Busy going nowhere, just wasting the time of day.
Walking down the road, kicking up the stones,
Nothing means nothing when you're empty and on your own.

But you put something better inside of me,
You put something better inside of me.
Makes me so much stronger,
I'm amazed at the change in me.

porque desobedeció
no más por una bañada
que en Jueves Santo se dio
y a la semana sagrada.

La sirena de la mar
me dicen que es muy bonita
yo la quisiera encontrar
pa' besarle su boquita
pero como es animal
no se puede naditita.

Una vez yo me embarqué
y en una barquita inglés
al pasar por Alemania
me dijo un sabio francés
en la costa americana
y alumbra el sol al revés."

to understanding where it is,
Using all it's found,
to help each other, hand in hand

The day the world gets 'round
to understanding where it's gone
Losing so much ground
killing each other, hand in hand
Such foolishness in man
I want no part of their plan - OH NO

If you're the destructive kind
Now I'm working from day to day
As I don't want to be like you
I look for the pure of heart
And the ones that have made a start,

But Lord, there are just a few
who bow before you,
in silence they pray,

Oh how they pray for the day the
world gets 'round

Using all they've found
To help each other, hand in hand

To the biggest show in town
So, honey, don't you make me late

If we leave really early and we hurry
We can get in with the band
'Cause little Tim Smitty's
Got his old man`s van

So let's get to getting
While the getting is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight

Ain't no one gonna change my tune
Don't you know that I love my music
Ain't never gonna change my tune

Hey, little girl, want to
Dance with you all night long
The music got me buzzing
And I feel pretty loose
I feel the rhythm and it's
Comin' on strong, baby, baby

Lay the rhythm on me, baby
There's power in the sound
With everybody jumping
We can bring the house down

For you it's dying day

Trying to get my head together
Waiting for the sun

I tried so hard to win
Sometimes I'd gamble  my own life
And anyone who crossed my path
Would never cross it twice
I'd take until there was nothing left
But the odds turned on me
Now I'm down and out again
Deep in misery

I've been a self-seeking man
Self-seeking man
Self-seeking man
Who lived for himself
Who wound up the fool
And got nothing for it

Thought I heard her voice begin to speak
My mind is in distress
On my cheek I felt her breath.

I could feel her body's warmin' glow
My frozen blood begn to flow
She's a night woman of my dreams
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam
Comes, stays, then disappears
In the morning sun my vision clears.

I could smell the roses in her hair
But when I awoke, she was not there.

Un escenario vacío
Un libro muerto de pena
Un dibujo destruído
Y la caridad ajena

Un televisor inútil
Eléctrica compañía
La radio a todo volumen
Y una prisión que no es mía

Una vejez sin temores
Y una vida reposada
Ventanas muy agitadas
Y una cama tan inmóvil

Y un montón de diarios apilados
Y una flor cuidando mi pasado
Y un rumor de voces que me gritan
Y un millón de manos que me aplauden
Y el fantasma tuyo, sobre todo
Cuando ya me empiece a quedar solo"

And holds me so strong...
Send a song on the wind to deliver me
Take me and rise, when the fire is on...
Take the reins, and the loneliness fillin' me
And make my fear fuel, and the fuel hi-octane

Down where the valleys are low, there's a refuge so high
And down where the coldest winds blow, there the warmest winds hide
And deep in the forest of woe, sweet deliverance is nigh
And deep in the heart there's a rose that a glimmer keeps guidin'

And the harmony is set to weave a silver sermon
And my heart's aflame until the blessed rhythm's churnin'

Lead the way thru the glories deceivin' me

Lend me a hand and I won't delay
Send a ray thru the seven veiled mysteries
And break their sweet spell, and their links of chain"

Through rock and through stone

Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail

I caught an aisle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes and red balloons
So I called up my local deejay
And he didn't have a lot to say
But the radio has learned all of my favorite tunes

Take it back, take it back
Oh no, you can't say that

The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon
And besides that we never liked you any way

Take it back, take it back

Aquella mujer celosa,
aquella feliz esposa
que nunca salió de casa... y
que siempre cuidó mimosa
en su jardín flores rojas
aquella mujer hermosa.

Partirá, no sabe adónde,
y al mirar el horizonte verá otra tierra;
dejará sus verdes trigos,
su mujer, y sus amigos para quererla

ya nunca será celosa
ya nunca será mimosa
solo podrá ser
¿la mujer de quién?
Y Pablo se Irá muy lejos
y cuando mire un espejo
verá que su sol se apagó.

Among these dark Satanic mills?

Bring me my arrows of desire!

And all the angels say just before you passed away
These were the very last words that you said

Put my socks in a cedar box just get ""em"" out of here

Sell my heart to the junkman and give my love to Rose

Give my knees to the needy don't pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walking cane it's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south and kiss my ass goodbye

Just like I knew they would

Oh, here I go again
Just where I've been before
A friend and nothing more

The tears, they grew much fewer now
Her body smelled of autumn's seed
And in my shaadows, I recall
About a friend in need

In blanket wrapped, she's sleeping now
And with a kiss she'll give her thanks
All friendship could allow

And I don't know just what's right or wrong.

The chance I might wake up and find you gone.

Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue.
Any brighter flame would be a lie.
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you,
But I know that I'll only make you cry.

A thief can only steal from you.  He cannot break your heart.
He'll never touch the precious things inside.

184,Electric Light Orchestra,The Fox,TRYHRTB128F92DA3F6,1973,"I wait till everyone's asleep
Then out into the night I creep
No one can see me now
Or hear me running, soundlessly

The moon's the only light I need
To search for food, young ones to feed
But as the dawn is drawing near the earth, my way's not clear
I'm trapped on the outside

Moonlight save me, moonlight save me
Moonlight save me, moonlight save me

Unearthly fear, it grips my skin
Unearthly sound, the hunt begins
I hear excited cries
But dare not look from where I'm hiding

The multi-coloured humans ride

Soon they will find me where I hide
The brown and white tormentors
Begin to howl and then I'm running

Moonlight save me

I cut across the trail I left five miles before
One chance to throw them off my scent but I'm not sure
An elder told me it had worked sometime before

My heart is beating like a drum
I make the ridge, but can't go on
I turn to face my death
But nothing comes to stop me breathing

Down in the clearing now I see
They're searching all around for me
Confusion everywhere
But I am safe up here, I've won, I've won, I've won, I've won, I've won."

Then haste a heart is broken

Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Now that she's not picking them with me?
Oh no, I don't care what they're doing there
'Neath the shade of the old apple tree

Hey, I bet they're laughing and talking love talk
Just like the way we used to do
Ah, who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Whispering 'I love you'?

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love-maker
That I ever had
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally?
Who's making love to her tonight?

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love-maker
That I ever had
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
While the Wabash moon is shining bright?

Had I been true to her
I'd be there now
In the strawberry patch with Sally tonight, oh yeah
In the strawberry patch with my Sally tonight"

Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside?

That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Killed the Czar and his ministers

I rode a tank
In a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the finest stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the Gods they made
I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid tracks for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

And all you sinner's Saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer

Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well learned qualities

I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake

Kids waited with toboggans as I sheltered from the snow
I waited for the river but the river did not flow.

Then go on his way leaving me here with another mouth to feed

You don't know how I feel
You don't seem to care
If I let you see it through my eyes
You wouldn't see anyone there

It's no wonder I been crying
It's no wonder that I'm blue
My crazy heart was gone and let somebody know
When it's time for me to go
Tired of being lonley
Tired of what you do to me
Hear it raining in my heart
Well I've been lonely before
But I've been so long without sunlight
I can't take another day more

No wonder I been crying
It's no wonder I been blue
My crazy heart can't tell me why
I can't tell you goodbye
Oh no, I'm tired of all this tragedy
I'm giving you back your misery

You better put on a fast one
I think I'm gonna pull through
You better play another fast one
No matter what you do
Put your money in a fast one
I don't wanna hear the blues
Put on another fast one
Trying to forget about you

Well it ain't no wonder I been crying
It's no wonder I been blue
My crazy heart can't tell me why
I can't tell you goodbye
Darling I'm tired of being lonely
Tired of what you put me through

Now you better put on a fast one
If you want me to pull through
You better play another fast one
No matter what you do
Put your money in a fast one
I don't wanna hear the blues
Put on another fast one
Trying to forget about you"

You might run across some of your old friends

All your loneliness I gotta soothe

Cause I've spent a lot of time down on the corner
Tasting tears and spilling whisky on the floor

Such a shame that it's so hard from me
To tell the truth to you,
But by now you know the kind of man I am;
So don't turn your pretty face away from me, dear
Cause there's kids and this game don't understand

One more night like this would put me six feet under
But my heart will still be fighting for your love
Just remember, little darling, that I love you
And kiss the children for me, please, before you go.

So don't play this crazy game with me no longer
Cause I won't be able to resist my rage
And the gun that's hangin on the kitchen wall, dear
Is like the road sign pointing straight to satan's cage.

Take your time she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning

I could be half the man I used to
They said you were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to

Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling second-hand tobaccos
Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising

And just to give me a hint 
I´ll use your favorite color 
Smear it with your favorite scent 
I know you think that i´m crazy 
But I can´t loose what have I left 
So i´ve decided to write this letter 
And send it to myself 
So to make my story short 
In the mail box I will kiss 
This letter that I wrote 
And it´s stamped with your lovely face 
When I´m alone 
And I need someone to talk to 
I talk to your picture 
Get me a pencil and paper 


And write all the things 
Say all the things i´ve heard you say before 
But with a little ´extra, extra read all about it´ 
Sugar and spice 
I guess it makes me feel kind of nice 
I write a letter to myself 
Oh, write another letter to myself 
I write another letter to myself 
Oh, write another letter to myself 
When is a home when you´re all alone 
It seems so full 
It seems so full 
And yet so empty 
Oh, I get my coat 
Leave you a note and go to the places 
Were we used to be

Aw such a shame - you must leave
All day long you were a friend to me
Still - the moon's company
Until morning when larks will sing
Horizon's appointment you'll keep
For sunswept flamingos must sleep
Scenes like these from my dreams
Cover cutting-room floors all over...

Warm heart we spin slowly from view
Why are you sad - do you disapprove?
How we've wasted our time
Sunset - end of my day - my decline
Postscript you trace colours the sky
Red-letter light fades, is filed away
Sunburst fingers you raise
One last sigh of farewell - goodbye"

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset and Jane is in her vest and me I'm in a rock and roll band
Riding in a Stutz Bearcat Jim, those were different times
And the poets studied rules of verse and all the ladies rolled their eyes.

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane.

Now Jack he is a banker and Jane she is a clerk
And they're both saving up all their money and when they come home from work
Sitting by the fire, radio's playin' a little classical music for you, kids
To the march of the wooden soldiers and you can hear Jack say.

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane.

Some people like to go out dancing, other people they got to work
And there's always some evil mothers, I tell you life is just full of dirt
And the women never really faint and the villains always blink their eyes
And children are the only ones that blush and that life is just to die
But anyone who had a heart, he wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, he wouldn't want to turn around and hate it.

The party was great till we ran out of wine
There was a knock upon the bedroom door my knees began to shake
And this man came in and melted all the candles on my cake

I'm might have cheated just a little bit baby

Living away cross town
But it won't be just about little while baby
Before you put me down

Now don't you go running across town baby
To catch me doing wrong
I'm just a little bit jealous baby

When green buds all are swellin'.
Sweet William on his deathbed lay for love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town,
The place where she did dwell in.
Saying, 'Master dear has sent me here if your name be Barbara Allen.'

Then slowly, slowly she got up and slowly she went to him,
And all she said when there she came was, 'Young man, I think you're dying.

'Don't you remember the other night when we were in the tavern?
You drank a toast to the ladies there and slighted Barbara Allen.'

He turned his face unto the wall,
He turned his back upon her.
'Adieu, adieu, to all my friends.
And be kind, be kind to Barbara Allen.'

As she was wandering on the fields she heard the death bell knellin'.
And every note, it seemed to say,
'Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!'

The more it tolled the more she grieved,
She bursted out a-crying.
'Oh, pick me up and carry me home.
I fear that I am dying.'

They buried Willy in the old church yard and Barbara in the new one,
And from William's grave, there grew a rose, from Barbara's, a green briar.

They grew and grew in the old church yard,
Till they could grow no higher,
And there they tied in a true lover's knot,
The red rose and the briar."

You were still sleeping,as i stood at the door
Once more i was heading to,God only knows where
That's when it hit me,i was already there

I could ramble,a thousand miles or more
Never find the light i've seen in your eyes before
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay

Why keep on running,just to wish on a star
Searching for Heaven,when i know where you are
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home"

De faire semblant d'être heureuse quand ils sont là 

Je bois toutes les nuits 
Mais tous les whiskies 
Pour moi on le même goût 
Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau 
Je ne sais plus où aller tu es partout

Je verse mon sang dans ton corps 
Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi tu dors

Tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots 
Pourtant moi j'avais du talent avant ta peau

Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera

Cos I'm so much in love with you baby
I just can't seem to get it clear
I'm just so much in love with you baby

Unless you're there when I get back home
And if you're not there I won't eat

Everything I want to do ...

I don't ever want a house and garden
In the quiet of a dead end town
But if that's what you require me
Then I'll want to settle down.
And I don't want kids of mine
Runnin' round and raisin' hell
But I don't care what my kids do
If they belong to you as well.

Everything I want to do ...

So come with me and stay with me
And be with me ev'rywhere I go
And love with me and live with me
And watch with me as the garden grows.

It's time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow a horn, start celebrating
Right this way, your table's waiting

What good's permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the Cabaret!

I used to have a girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower...
As a matter of fact, she rented by the hour

The day she died the neighbors came to snicker:
""Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor!""
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest corpse I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turn to me and say
""What good is sitting all alone in you room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the Cabaret!""

And as for me, and as for me
I made my mind up back in Chelsea
When I go
I'm going like Elsie

Start by admitting from cradle to tomb
It isn't that long a stay
Life is a cabaret, old chum
It's only a cabaret, old chum
And I love a cabaret!"

You can almost see it

Time will let you know
And when you turn around to go
The aching in your heart begins to show
You can almost see it

You can almost see it
You can almost see it
You can almost see it going by

It was an instant cosmic need
A Teenage Love Affair

It was getting hotter minute by minute
As each second brought her closer to me.

And then we -
Finally touched and
We touched and we touched
And her hands felt their way over me

So we made love there in the daytime
When her mama left, we went upstairs.
It was a total cosmic deed
A Teenage Love Affair.

A teenage love affair.
Teenage love affair,

And i didn't know just what to say.
It really -
Brought me down
You know it turned me around
Cause no girl had ever done me that way.

But it didn't take long til I found out
That there's a lotta sexy girls out there.
And I've got a built-in cosmic need

May burn and scorch his beauty
And if I was with my love
I would do my duty.

Strange news is come to town
Strange news is carried
Strange news flies up and down
That my love is married.
I wish them both much joy
Though they can't hear me
And may God reward him well
For the slighting of me.

Don't you remember when
You lay beside me
And you said you'd marry me
And not deny me.
If I said I'd marry you
It was only for to try you
So bring your witness love
And I'll not deny you.

No, witness have I none
Save God Almighty
And may he reward you well
For the slighting of me.
Her lips grew pale and wan
It made a poor heart tremble
To think she loved a one
And he proved deceitful.

A blacksmith courted me
Nine months and better
He fairly won my heart
Wrote me a letter.
With his hammer in his hand
He looked so clever
And if I was with my love I would live forever."

There's a card game in the courtyard

and the winner loses all

when the judge checks his supper

it's so small



and the hills are grey with trouble

and the dry spring gathers dust

your lover's crying in the valley

she lost her trust

(HARP SOLO)



but there is a road to glory

somehow hidden in the past

behind the gold, behind the treasure

behind the mask



then comes a team of four white horses

and a lady with night-black hair

and she looks to be such a fine one

but is she really there

I've gotta knooooooooow

I've gotta knooooooooow

I've gotta knooooooooooooooooooooooooow............."
273,10cc,Sand In My Face,TRHOHUG128F935A174,1973,"I looked in the mirror
(What did you see looking at you)
I saw a nine stone weakling
(What will you do)

Dynamic tension waiting for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of you

I opened my magazine
(What did you see)
I saw Mr. France
(What did he have)
A girl on each shoulder
(What else)
And one in his pants

Dynamic tension can do this for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of you you you you you

So our hero goes down to the beach
He's in real terrible shape
His chick's been seen with big Alex
That mother kicked sand in his face
Now let me tell you about Alex
He's got
Hands like hams
Knees like trees
200 lbs
Of surfboard Hercules

Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I lost my girl down by the beach
She's with Alex, and she's out of reach
So please Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I saw your body in an advert on T.V.
But what convinced me was your money back guarantee

Now I'm stronger than Alex
(Where is he now)
He's left in disgrace
(Oh yeah)
Cause I took back my girlfriend
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And kicked sand in his face
(In his eyes, in his ears, in his nose)

Dynamic tension waiting for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of you
Dynamic tension, Dynamic tension
Dynamic tension, Dynamic tension
Dynamic tension, Dynamic tension"
274,Jo Jo Gunne,High School Drool (LP Version),TROCNTB128F147EC1B,1973,"Who's that under the bleachers?
That's Louis
Let me tell you about Louis

Louis was a mover and he wasn't no fool
But he had a little trouble with his high school drool
He was a low motivator, a fast calculator on the little girls
Ooh, out in the schoolyard buyin' anything
Checkin' out good what the new boys bring
You can't see the clock and you never hear the ring but who cares?

Talk fine, feelin' cool
Lookin' so dragged by the whole damn thing
You wanna know the answer, I just play the fool
Gotta see a man about my high school drool

Ridin' out to county line the fingers in your hair
The good smoke, some bad wine, no one seems to care
You hear some joker come screamin' on the air
Just trying to sell it to you
He's trying to sell it to you

Ninety miles an hour with your feet against the floor
You never saw the lights and you never heard the roar
You'd laugh if it hit 'cause it's all such a bore anyway

Talk fine, feelin' cool
Lookin' so dragged by the whole damn thing
You wanna know the answer, I just play the fool
Gotta see a man about my high school drool

Talk fine, feelin' cool
Riding high sweet street machine
You wanna know the questions I just play the fool
Gotta see a man about my high school drool"

Said there's no way to explain the kind of feeling
That you get out in the rain, she's good, she's good to me
See this emptiness inside, it makes me scream
It make me crawl out of my high, she's good, she's good to me
Oh no no no no no no

Write me a letter

Well, I've been away forever, suicide's crossin' my mind
