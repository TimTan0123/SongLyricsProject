0,Blind Blake,Champagne Charlie Is My Name,TRKUQPR128F427F944,1932,"If you seen my true love never been there but
Shoes and stocking in our hands and our feet all over the floor

Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name
Champagne Charlie is my name by golly
And roguein' and stealin' is my game

I went down to Louisville and I ain't been there before
And a great big bully knocked me down and I betn't go
Back no more

Well, I got drunk last night and
All the nights before
Ain't gonna get drunk no more
Drunk no more"
1,Blind Willie McTell,Searching the Desert for the Blues,TRFPUZK128F428938C,1932,"You may search the ocean, you might go 'cross the deep blue sea
But Mama, you'll never find another hot shot like me

I followed my baby from the station to the train
And the blues came down like night and showered me

I left her at the station wringing her hands and crying
I told her she had a home, just as long as I had mine

I've got two women, and you can't tell them apart
I've got one in my bossom, and one I got in my heart

The one in my bossom, she's in Tennessee
And the one in my heart, don't even give a darn for me

I used to say a married woman was the sweetest thing that ever been born
But I've changed that thing, you better leave married women alone

Take my advice: let these married women be
'Cause their husbands'll grab you, beat you ragged as a cedar tree

When a woman say she love you 'bout good as she do herself,
I don't pay her no attention, tell that same line to somebody else

I really don't believe no woman in the whole round world do right,
Act like an angel in the daytime, mess by the ditch at night

I'm going, pretty mama, please don't break this rule;
That's why I'm searching these deserts for the blues

I'm going, pretty mama, searching these deserts now
That's why I'm walking my baby home anyhow

Lord, oh Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Oh Lordy Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

When a woman say she love you 'bout good as she do herself,
I don't pay her no attention, tell that same line to somebody else

Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord"
2,Blind Willie McTell,Rollin' Mama Blues,TREKKYO12903CB0F4A,1932,"Now tell me baby
How do you want your rollin' done?
Now tell me baby
How do you want your rollin' done?

I want you to start in the mornin' baby
And roll me with the settin' of the sun

Oh, roll me on my belly baby
Feed me with your chocolate drop
Oh, roll me on my belly baby
Feed me with your chocolate drop

I want you to keep it all for your daddy
And don't give nobody none

Want you to roll me baby
Like the baker rolls his dough
Want you to roll me baby
Like the baker rolls his dough

And if you get some of my lovin'
You won't want your rider no more

Oh, reel and rock me baby
Honey, if it's all night long
Oh, reel and rock me baby
Honey, if it's all night long

You don't have to worry about your lovin'
I'm a deep sea diver and I don't go wrong

Won't you come back baby?
You got me all confused
Won't you come back baby?
You got me all confused

That's why I'm singin'
These barrel house woman blues"
3,Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),TROHBNM128F42BBA0A,1932,"What good is melody?
What good is music?
If it ain't possessing something sweet

It ain't the melody
It ain't the music
There's something else that makes this song complete

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Well it don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got YES

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing boy

I said it don't mean a thing and all you got to do is sing

Now it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev-ry-thing you got OHH
It don't mean a thing boy, if it ain't got-a-that-a-swinga

Show me"
4,Peetie Wheatstraw,Police Station Blues,TRMOGYJ128F930B7DA,1932,"Well-oh-well
Mama, now on some old rainy day
Hoo-hoo-um-mm
Babe, I see you some old rainy day
Well-well now, you're gonna be sorry
Hoo-hoo-um-um
Babe, now you walked away

Well-well, sun did rose
Mama, now just before the trees
I said now when the sun broke
Ooo-um-mm, just a'fore the trees
Well, now I went to the police station, ask them
Plan on gettin' me my little girl, please

Now-now-now, your days so lonesome
Mama, yo nights so dreadful long
Hoo, times can run me down
Hee-hoo-umm
Babe, now yo' nights so dreadful long
Well-well, spent so many lonesome days
Hoo-hoo-well, babe since I been gone

(guitar)

Well, babe tomorrow is Sunday
Hoo-hoo-umm
Baby, you may see me Christmas Eve
Hoo-hoo-well, know the meaning
I said honey, now tomorrow Sunday
Hee-hoo-ooo, next day was Christmas Eve
Well-well, have I got a present mama, babe
Und' your lil' Christmas tree?

Baby now, when are you gon' give me
Hoo-hoo-umm
Mama now things you promised me?
(Know the kind) know now I mean it
Hee-hee-umm
Mama now things you promised me?
Well-well, you know I don't see why
Baby now, you so hard on me."
5,Tampa Red,Western Bound Blues,TRGZLKA128F9359961,1932,"If you lose your money, don't lose your mind
If you lose your money, don't lose your mind
And if you lose your sweet woman, well brother you better not mess with mine

If you ever been down, I know you know just how I feel
If you ever been down, you know just how I feel
Why I feel just like a dyin' soldier, across the battlefield

Baby I'm goin' out west, and don't wanna leave you behind
I'm goin' out west, and I don't wanna leave you behind
Because I'm afraid that when I return baby, I'm afraid that you won't be mine

(spoken:)
Aw shucks - you know what I'm talkin' about
Then how do you think I feel to go away and come back
And find you in another guy's arms
I take a brickbat and break your neck
And I don't mean maybe neither

What's the use of walkin', for when there's a freight train goin' your way
What's the use of walkin', and there's a freight train goin' your way
(I heard the train blow)
If my mind don't chage, I'm western bound today

Put your arms around me baby, just like a circle around the sun
Put your arms around me baby, like a circle around the sun
That's the way baby, Papa Red wants his lovin' done
(You hear me talkin', and I don't mean maybe, that's all)"
6,Tampa Red,You Can't Get That Stuff No More,TRBTJBU128F42806AE,1932,"You know bootleg sally used to live across town
The law went there and they closed 'r down

Chorus:
Now you can't get that stuff no more
Now you can't get that stuff no more
No matter how you try, you can't buy
You can't get that stuff no more

You know that place on dago hill
The law took the gal and the liquor still
(chorus)

Li'l suzanne she used to sell her grease
She got in trouble with the chief o' police
(chorus)

There goes joe with a great big knife
Somebody been messin' round with his wife
Now he can't get that stuff no more
Now he can't get that stuff no more
No matter how he try, he can't buy
He can't get that stuff no more

Play it!

On state street they used to give it away
But now you can't it if you offer to pay
(chorus)

All of the gals used to walk the street
The law done run 'r off his beat
(chorus)

Ah play it...
You can't get that stuff no more
You can't get that stuff no more
No matter how you try, you can't buy
You can't get that stuff no more"
7,Tampa Red,Turpentine Blues,TRPDHCE128F42806B4,1932,"Turpentine's all right, provided that wages are good
Turpentine's all right, provided that wages are good
But i can make more money now, by somewhere choppin' hardwood

Turpentine business ain't like it used to be
Turpentine business ain't like it used to be
I can't make enough money now, to even get on a spree

I ain't gonna work no more, i tell you the reason why
I ain't gonna work no more, tell you the reason why
Because everybody wants to sell, and nobody wants to buy

You can work in the field, you can work at the sawmill too
You can work in the field, you can work at the sawmill too
But you can't make no money, at nothin' you try to do

So lordy please tell me what we turpentine people are gonna do
Lordy please tell me what we turpentine people gonna do
We may work one week, but we got to lay off a month or two

Turpentine is like dice, to shoot you up on the loose
Turpentine is just like dice, to shoot you up on the loose
That's the reason why, i've got those turpentine blues"
