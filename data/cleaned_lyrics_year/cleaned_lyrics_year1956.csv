0,Al Hibbler,After The Lights Go Down Low,TRHARXL12903CAB514,1956,"After the lights go down low, baby, you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
And when the dancin' is through and folks will be few
I'll be here sittin' with no one but you
And I'll be needin' you so after the lights go down low

I wanna hold you, squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you, please you and make you understand
And when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a good time

After the lights go down low, baby, you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
And we can cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I've got some sweet talk that you want to hear
And I'll be needin' you so after the lights go down low

After the lights go down low, baby, you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
And when the dancin' is through and folks will be few
I'll be here sittin' with no one but you
And I'll be needin' you so after the lights go down low

I wanna hold you, squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you, please you and make you understand
And when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a good time

After the lights go down low, baby, you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
And we can cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I've got some sweet talk that you want to hear
And I'll be needin' you so after the lights go down low"
1,B.B. King,Bad Luck,TRMFWZK128F92E3081,1956,"Well, my bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
Bad luck is falling
Falling down like rain
No matter what I do
Seems like my luck won't never change

I felt kinda lucky
My luck was running slow
The last hand I caught four aces
And the police broke down the door
I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money
Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you

Yeah, I got home this morning
She was looking kinda funny
She said ""Don't come in, daddy
Daddy, unless you got some money""
And I said, Lord
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money
Without your woman turning her back on you

Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner
She looked at me like a fool
She said, ""I'm playing checkers, daddy
And I think it's your turn to move""
I said, oh
Lord, what can a poor boy do?
Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money
And your woman turns her back on you"
2,B.B. King,Everyday I Have The Blues,TRCCEHV128F4215E1D,1956,"Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
Everyday, everyday I have the blues 
When you see me worried baby 
Because it's you I hate to lose 

Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Yes nobody loves me, nobody seems to care 
Speaking of bad luck and trouble 
Well you know I had my share 

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line 
Yes I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line 
Where there ain't nobody worried 
And there ain't nobody crying"

The way you've been treating me woman
Is coming back home to you
And your crying won't help you woman
Oh, crying won't help you baby
Oh, crying won't help you woman

I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why"
6,B.B. King,You Know I Love You,TREALXP12903CB0441,1956,"Darlin', darlin' you know I love you 
I love you, for myself 
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else 

I think of you, think of you every morning 
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always 

When night began to fall 
I cry, cry alone 
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight 

Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you 
I love you, for myself 
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else"
7,Big Maybelle,Candy,TRROHXD128F9308857,1956,"Candy
Why, I call my sugar candy
Mmm, I'm sweet on candy
And candy, he's sweet on me

He understands me
Yes, my understandin' candy
Hmm, my candy's always handy
Just when I need sympathy

Oh, I wish that there were four of him
And I could love
Love that much more of him
He has taken my complete heart
And I got a sweet-tooth for my sweet-heart

Candy, candy, candy
He's gonna be just dandy
Hmm, the day that I take my candy
And make him mine
Mine, yes
Oh mine, yeah

The day that I take my candy
And make him mine
All mine"
8,Bill Haley & His Comets,Rip It Up,TRGEIDC12903CC8CED,1956,"Saturday night and I just got paid
I'm a fool about my money, don't try to save.
My heart says ""go go, have a time""
Saturday night and I'm feelin' fine.
 
I'm gonna rock it up, whoo
Rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it
And ball tonight.

9,Bill Haley and his Comets,Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,TRCTZQZ128F42420C3,1956,"Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack
 
To pal around with democratic fellows named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack
 
Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo
Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
 
You reach your destination but you don't go back
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
But the only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack
 
Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo
Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
 
Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life o'riley in the beaten down shack
When i hear a whistle i can peep thru the crack
Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack"
10,Billie Holiday,Willow Weep For Me,TRHJMRX128EF35168B,1956,"Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovely dreams
Lovely summer dreams
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears along the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a sign
And crying alone
Murmur to the night
Hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
Crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to me plead
Hear me willow and weep for me
Willow
Willow
Weep for me"
11,Billie Holiday,Love Me or Leave Me,TRBJDAP12903CF0A5E,1956,"This suspense is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainty
Tell me now, I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or go

Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with somebody else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give back tomorrow
For your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else"
12,Billie Holiday,Lady Sings The Blues,TRZYZCB128E079145B,1956,"Lady sing the blues,
She's got them bad,
She feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
Just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
Nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
Just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
I know I won't die,
'cause I love him

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
But now the world will know,
She's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,
When you get a bad start,
When you and your man have to part

Ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
I know I won't die,
'cause I love him

Lady sings the blues,
I'm tellin' you, she's got them bad,
But now the world will know,
She's never gonna sing them no more."
13,Bing Crosby & Grace Kelly,True Love,TRWBBZC128F92F1B7F,1956,"Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are

While I give to you
And you give to me
True love, true love

So on and on
It'll always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothin' to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
Love forever true"
14,Bo Diddley,Down Home Special,TRESXGW128F426425A,1956,"I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down
I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down
I've been looking all night long, she can't be found
Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked
Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked

She said get away from here country boy, go back to your countryside
Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me
Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me
Well if I had you baby, you wouldn't be lookin' back at me

Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye
Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye
Well now bye-bye baby, with a tear in your eye"
15,Boris Vian,Le petit commerce,TRMJVMC12903CC9754,1956,"J'ai vendu du mouron
Mais ça n'a pas marché
J'ai vendu des cravates
Les gens étaient fauchés
J'ai vendu des ciseaux
Et des lames de rasoir
Des peignes en corozo
Des limes et des hachoirs
J'ai essayé les fraises
J'ai tâté du muguet
J'ai rempaillé des chaises
Réparé des bidets
Je tirais ma charrette
Sur le mauvais pavé
J'allais perdre la tête
Mais j'ai enfin trouvé

Je roule en Cadillac dans les rues de Paris
Depuis que j'ai compris la vie
J'ai un petit hôtel, trois domestiques et un chauffeur
Et les flics me saluent comme un des leurs
Je vends des canons
Des courts et des longs
Des grands et des petits
J'en ai à tous les prix
Y a toujours amateur pour ces délicats instruments
Je suis marchand de canons venez me voir pour vos enfants
Canons à vendre!

Avec votre ferraille
On forge ces engins
Qui foutront la pagaille
Parmi ceux du voisin
Ça donne de l'ouvrage
A tous les ouvriers
Et chacun envisage
De fonder un foyer
Pour se faire des finances
On fabrique des lardons
On touche l'assurance
Et les allocations
Ça n'a pas d'importance
Car lorsqu'ils seront grands
Ils iront en cadence
Crever pour quelques francs

Je vendais des canons dans les rues de la terre
Mais mon commerce a trop marché
J'ai fait faire des affaires à tous les fabricants de cimetières
Mais moi maintenant je me retrouve à pied
Tous mes bons clients
Sont morts en chantant
Et seul dans la vie
Je vais sans soucis
Aux coins des vieilles rues, le coeur content, le pied léger
Je danse la carmagnole, y a plus personne sur le pavé
Canons en solde!"
16,Boris Vian,Je Bois,TRGRROB128F9338D2F,1956,"Je bois
Systématiquement
Pour oublier les amis de ma femme
Je bois
Systématiquement
Pour oublier tous mes emmerdements

Je bois
N'importe quel jaja
Pourvu qu'il ait ses douze degrés cinque
Je bois
La pire des vinasses
C'est dégueulasse, mais ça fait passer l'temps

La vie est-elle tell'ment marrante
La vie est-elle tell'ment vivante
Je pose ces deux questions
La vie vaut-elle d'être vécue
L'amour vaut-il qu'on soit cocu
Je pose ces deux questions
Auxquelles personne ne répond
 
Et
Je bois
Systématiquement
Pour oublier le prochain jour du terme
Je bois
Systématiquement
Pour oublier que je n'ai plus vingt ans

Je bois
Dès que j'ai des loisirs
Pour être saoul, pour ne plus voir ma gueule
Je bois
Sans y prendre plaisir
Pour pas me dire qu'il faudrait en finir

Je bois
Dès que j'ai des loisirs
Pour être saoul, pour ne plus voir ma gueule
Je bois
Sans y prendre plaisir
Pour pas me dire qu'il faudrait en finir"
17,Boris Vian,La Java Des Bombes Atomiques,TRNBPGB128F9300F28,1956,"Mon oncle, un fameux bricoleur
Faisait en amateur
Des bombes atomiques
Sans avoir jamais rien appris
C'était un vrai génie
Question travaux pratiques

Il s'enfermait toute la journée
Au fond de son atelier
Pour faire des expériences
Et le soir il rentrait chez nous
Et nous mettait en transe
En nous racontant tout

Pour fabriquer une bombe A
Mes enfants, croyez-moi
C'est vraiment de la tarte
La question du détonateur
Se résout en un quart d'heure
C'est de celles qu'on écarte

En ce qui concerne la bombe H
C'est pas beaucoup plus vache
Mais une chose me tourmente
C'est que celles de ma fabrication
N'ont qu'un rayon d'action
De trois mètres cinquante

Y'a quelque chose qui cloche là-dedans
J'y retourne immédiatement

Il a bossé pendant des jours
Tachant avec amour
D'améliorer le modèle
Quand il déjeunait avec nous
Il avalait d'un coup
Sa soupe au vermicelle

On voyait à son air féroce
Qu'il tombait sur un os
Mais on n'osait rien dire
Et puis un soir pendant le repas
Voilà tonton qui soupire
Et qui nous fait comme ça

A mesure que je deviens vieux
Je m'en aperçois mieux
J'ai le cerveau qui flanche
Soyons sérieux, disons le mot
C'est même plus un cerveau
C'est comme de la sauce blanche

Voilà des mois et des années
Que j'essaye d'augmenter
La portée de ma bombe
Et je ne me suis pas rendu compte
Que la seule chose qui compte
C'est l'endroit où ce qu'elle tombe

Y'a quelque chose qui cloche là-dedans,
J'y retourne immédiatement

Sachant proche le résultat
Tous les grands chefs d'État
Lui ont rendu visite
Il les reçut et s'excusa
De ce que sa cagna
Était aussi petite

Mais sitôt qu'ils sont tous entrés
Il les a enfermés
En disant ""Soyez sages!""
Et, quand la bombe a explosé
De tous ces personnages
Il n'en est rien resté

Tonton devant ce résultat
Ne se dégonfla pas
Et joua les andouilles
Au tribunal on l'a traîné
Et devant les jurés
Le voilà qui bafouille

Messieurs, c'est un hasard affreux
Mais je jure devant Dieu
Qu'en mon âme et conscience
En détruisant tous ces tordus
Je suis bien convaincu
D'avoir servi la France

On était dans l'embarras
Alors on le condamna
Et puis on l'amnistia
Et le pays reconnaissant
L'élu immédiatement
Chef du gouvernement"
18,Boris Vian,Les Joyeux Bouchers,TRNJIAG128F9340566,1956,"C'est le tango des bouchers de la Villette
C'est le tango des tueurs des abattoirs
Venez cueillir la fraise et l'amourette
Et boire du sang avant qu'il soit tout noir

Faut que ça saigne
Faut que les gens aient à bouffer
Faut que les gros puissent se goinfrer
Faut que les petits puissent engraisser
Faut que ça saigne
Faut que les mandataires aux halles
Puissent s'en fourrer plein la dalle
Du filet à huit cents balles
Faut que ça saigne
Faut que les peaux se fassent tanner
Faut que les pieds se fassent panner
Que les tête aillent mariner
Faut que ça saigne
Faut avaler de la barbaque
Pour être bien gras quand on claque
Et nourrir des vers comaques
Faut que ça saigne
Bien fort!

C'est le tango des joyeux militaires
Des gais vainqueurs de partout et d'ailleurs
C'est le tango des fameux va-t'en guerre
C'est le tango de tous les fossoyeurs

Faut que ça saigne
Appuie sur la baïonnette
Faut que ça rentre ou bien que ça pète
Sinon t'auras une grosse tête
Faut que ça saigne
Démolis-en quelques-uns
Tant pis si c'est des cousins
Fais-leur sortir le raisin
Faut que ça saigne
Si c'est pas toi qui les crèves
Les copains prendront la relève
Et tu joueras la Vie brève
Faut que ça saigne
Demain ça sera ton tour
Demain ça sera ton jour
Plus de bonhomme et plus d'amour

Tiens! voilà du boudin! voilà du boudin!
Voilà du boudin!"
19,Chet Atkins,Third Man Theme,TRYTOXE128F424D5AF,1956,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme"
20,Chet Baker,My Funny Valentine,TRWDOGU128F9344D4E,1956,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day"
21,Chet Baker,But Not For Me,TRHCKVL128F92FC04E,1956,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss"
22,Chet Baker,I fall in love too easily,TRCRHGZ128F9339872,1956,"I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily
I fall in love too fast

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast"
23,Chet Baker,There Will Never Be Another You,TRQRCHJ128F92CE3C2,1956,"There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you."
24,Chet Baker,Look For the Silver Lining,TRNBRNY12903D0226B,1956,"As I wash my dishes, I'll be following a plan
Til I see the brightness in every pot and pan
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind
So I'll keep repeating in my mind:

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember, somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

A heart, full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life"
25,Chuck Berry,Brown Eyed Handsome Man,TRGNBZQ128C7196322,1956,"A-a-arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judges wife called up the district attorney
She said, ""Free that brown-eyed man.
If you want your job, you better free that brown-eyed man.""

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand.
She'd been walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man,
Her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Way back in history, three thousand years,
In fact ever since the world began,
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears
All for a  brown-eyed handsome man,
(It)'sa lot of trouble with a brown-eyed handsome man.

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man.
Her mother told her, ""Darling go out and find yourself
A brown-eyed handsome man,
Just like your daddy He's a brown-eyed handsome man.""

Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass,
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To meet  a brown-eyed handsome man,
She fought and won herself a brown-eyed handsome man.

2-3 the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
Roundin' third, he was headed for home

I'm gonna mail it to my local D.J.
Yeah and it's a jumpin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's risin'
The jukebox's blowin' a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keep-a singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rollin' athritis
Sittin' down at a rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
They rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel and like it
Go get your lover then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up, yes-a
Try for further then
Reel and rock with one another
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

Well early in the mornin'
And I'm givin' you my mornin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle-diddle, I'm-a play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see 'em reel an rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues"

Never failed in the mail, yet come a rotten bill
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Salesman talking to me tryin' to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week
Ah, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Blonde haired, good lookin' tryin' to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down, write a book
Ha, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Same thing every day, gettin' up, goin' to school
No need to be complainin', my objections overruled
Ah, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Pay phone, somethin' wrong, dime gone, will mail
I ought to sue the operator for tellin' me a tale
Ah, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

I been to Yokohama, been a fightin' in the war
Army bunk, army chow, army clothes, army car
Ha, too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Workin' in the fillin' station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas

Too much monkey business for me"

Ever - drifting?
You, from the start never lifting
I fight it but it downs me
Despite the joy around me
I can't free myself from sorrow

All through the day it's a wonder
Fall will the night, still I wonder
If I'm the only
Or are you as lonely
Come home to me tomorrow
Why should the past so change
How you feel!
Oh but I ask you
""Forgive, if you will""
These lonely hours are
So hard to bear
I don't deny that I was unfair

You paid enough to be gay
Who made me love you this way?
So give me the chance
To renew our romance
For this time I know it will stay
Oh yes, this time I know it will stay"

Et tous les soirs sous sa fenêtre on peut te voir.

Je sais bien que tu l’adores,

Et qu’elle a de jolis yeux,

Mais tu es trop jeune encore

Et gratte, gratte sur ta mandoline
Mon petit Bambino,
Ta musique est plus jolie
Que tout le ciel de l’Italie
Et chante, chante de ta voix câline
Mon petit Bambino
Tu peux chanter tant que tu veux
Elle ne te prend pas au sérieux

Avec tes cheveux si blonds,
— Bambino, bambino
Tu as l’air d’un chérubin.
— Bambino, bambino
Vas plutôt jouer au ballon,
— Bambino, bambino
Comme font tous les gamins.

Tu peux fumer comme un Monsieur des cigarettes,
Te déhancher sur le trottoir quand tu la guettes,
Tu peux pencher sur ton oreille ta casquette,
Ce n’est pas ça, qui dans son cœur, te vieillira.

L’amour et la jalousie
— Bambino, bambino
Ne sont pas des jeux d’enfant,
— Bambino, bambino
Et tu as toute la vie

Pour souffrir comme les grands.

Si tu as trop de tourments,

Ne les garde pas pour toi
— Bambino, bambino
Vas les dire à ta maman,

Et là, blotti dans l’ombre douce de ses bras,
Pleure un bon coup, et ton chagrin s’envolera."

Will you always treat me tenderly

If I give my heart to you 
Will you give me all your love 
Will you swear that you'll be true to me 
By the light that shines above 

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad 
Smile with me when I'm glad 
And always be as you are with me tonight 

Think it over and be sure 
Please don't answer till you do 
When you promise all those things to me

She's my Texarkana baby
Do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas
Her maw from Arkansas.

I'm twisted round her finger
Like a little piece of string
And yet I'm satisfied because
She's such a precious thing.

If she hauled off and slapped me
I would never feel the sting
She's my Texarkana baby

She's my Texarkana baby
Do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas
And her maw from Arkansas.

She's pretty as a picture
And you ought to hear her name
It's sweet as sarghum syrup
And good ol' blue ribbon cane.

She gives me lots of sugar
and she never spills a grain
she's my Texarkana baby.

She's my Texarkana baby
Do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas
And her maw from Arkansas.

One night I went a callin'
On my pretty little maid
I must admit to you
I was a little bit afraid.

To offer her a diamond ring
With one installment pay
She's my Texarkana baby.

She's my Texarkana baby
Do I love her Lowdy Law
Her pappy came from Texas
And her maw from Arkansas.

She's got two eyes that twinkle
Like a good ol' country star
She's got a perfect figure
That'll stop you where you are.

Why everytime I look at her
I think of my guitar
She's my Texarkana baby..."

But everything in it's his own.

So don't think of taking his loved one
It's written Thou shall not steal
Don't rob another man's castle
No matter how lonesome you feel.

Don't rob another man's castle
Don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know then how you'll pay.

Anytime your world is lonely
And you'll find true friends a few

Stars are smiling Molly darling
Through a misty veil of night
They seem laughing Molly darling
While the Moon hides her light

Oh, no one listens but the flowers
While they hang their heads in shame

When silence proves that you've forgotten me

The dream I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart

It's a sin to hide behind this heartache
To make-believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you
When people know I'm still in love with you

I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you
When deep inside, I know that it's a sin"

I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr
I'd take you up and stroke you and listen to you purr

Pointed to the dying Saviour now they dwell with him above

And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
To you, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been

For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
To never, never know
The one who loves you so

Comme égaré, presque ignoré
Voici qu'en la nuit étoilée
Un nouveau-né nous est donné
Jean-François Nicot il se nomme
Il est joufflu, tendre et rosé
À l'église, beau petit homme,
Demain tu seras baptisé

Une cloche sonne, sonne
Sa voix d'écho en écho
Dit au monde qui s'étonne:
«C'est pour Jean-François Nicot»
C'est pour accueillir une âme
Une fleur qui s'ouvre au jour
À peine, à peine une flamme
Encore faible qui réclame
Protection, tendresse, amour

Village au fond de la vallée
Loin des chemins, loin des humains
Voici qu'après dix-neuf années
Cœur en émoi, le Jean-François
Prend pour femme la douce Élise
Blanche comme fleur de pommier
Devant Dieu, dans la vieille église
Ce jour il se sont mariés

Toutes les cloches sonnent, sonnent
Leurs voix d'écho en écho
Merveilleusement couronnent
La noce à François Nicot
«Un seul cœur, une seule âme»,
Dit le prêtre, «et pour toujours
Soyez une pure flamme
Qui s'élève et qui proclame
La grandeur de votre amour»

Village au fond de la vallée
Des jours, des nuits, le temps a fui
Voici qu'en la nuit étoilée
Un cœur s'endort, François est mort...
Car toute chair est comme l'herbe
Elle est comme la fleur des champs
Épis, fruits mûrs, bouquets et gerbes,
Hélas tout va se desséchant

Une cloche sonne, sonne
Elle chante dans le vent
Obsédante et monotone
Elle redit aux vivants:
«Ne tremblez pas cœurs fidèles
Dieu vous fera signe un jour!
Vous trouverez sous son aile
Avec la vie éternelle
L'éternité de l'amour»"

Where true love conquers
In the whiles
And starve together dear, in Chiles

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say

Summer journeys to Niag'ra
And to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares;

I've a cozy little flat in
What is known as old Manhattan,
We'll settle down
Right here in town.

CHORUS 1

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through the Zoo.

It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street you know.
The subway charms us so,
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 2

We'll go to Greenwich,
Where modern men itch
To be free,
And Bowling Green you'll see with me.

We'll bathe at Brighton,
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in,
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin,

Fin to fin.

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica
Bay with you,
And fair Canarsie's Lakes we'll view.

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 3

We'll go to Yonkers,
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear, in Childs'.

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny
On a roll,
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole,
Soul to soul.

And South Pacific
Is a terrific
Show they say,
We both may see it close some day.

The city's clamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy.

CHORUS 4

We'll have Manhattan,
The Bronx and Staten
Island too,
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue.

As black as onyx
We'll find the Bronix
Park Express,
Our Flatbush flat, I guess,
Will be a great success,
More or less.

A short vacation
On Inspiration
Point we'll spend,
And in the station house we'll end.

But Civic Virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy --
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy!"

As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I love the rowing on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp"

It must go to someone of course
It can't be a sister or a brother
And so I love my horse

But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me."

And stars fell on Alabama
Last night

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me

My Arms wound around you tight

Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day and everything's okay

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke
They broke and oh
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and I
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day"

Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark

And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London town
Had me low, and it had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm

How long, I wondered, could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere"

Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we

I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly

Your arms are opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly"

I need no soft light to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight

'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border... Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered ""manana""
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay

Devant personne
Maintenant je rampe et je fais le beau
Quand ell' me sonne
J'étais chien méchant, ell' me fait manger
Dans sa menotte
J'avais des dents d'loup, je les ai changées
Pour des quenottes

Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée

Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée
Qui fait Maman quand on la touche

J'étais dur à cuire, ell' m'a converti
La fine bouche
Et je suis tombé tout chaud, tout rôti
Contre sa bouche
Qui a des dents de lait quand elle sourit
Quand elle chante
Et des dents de loup quand elle est furie
Qu'elle est méchante

Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée
Qui ferm' les yeux quand on la couche
Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée
Qui fait Maman quand on la touche

Je subis sa loi, je fis le tout doux
Sous son empire
Bien qu'ell' soit jalouse au-delà de tout
Et même pire
Un' jolie pervenche qui m'avait paru
Plus jolie qu'elle
Un' jolie pervenche un jour en mourut
À coups d'ombrelle

Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée
Qui ferm' les yeux quand on la couche
Je m'suis fait tout p'tit devant un' poupée
Qui fait Maman quand on la touche

Tous les somnambules, tous les mages m'ont
Dit sans malice
Qu'en ses bras en croix, je subirais mon
Dernier supplice
Il en est de pir's il en est d'meilleurs
Mais à tout prendre
Qu'on se pende ici, qu'on se pende ailleurs
S'il faut se pendre

A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
He spent his younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward-bound
Made him a slave to his wandering ways

And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

Oh I met him there in a border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best to settle down
I'm now alone with a broken heart

And the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wander
And he was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind
The next of kin to the wayward wind"

Sweeter than the flowers down in New Orleans

She'll play a little rhythm do the boogie up right
The Tennessee polka maybe blues in the night
Everybody travels from near and far
To hear her when she picks it on that old guitar
She's my music makin' mama from Memphis Tennessee

Break (guitar)

You can hear her in the evening when the sun sinks low
A singin' and a pickin' on that old banjo
You wanna jive when the words roll out of her mouth
Everybody's callin' her the Queen of the South
She's my fiddle playin' mama from Memphis Tennessee

Break (fiddle)

You gotta start dancin' when she gets in the groove
Picks the big bass fiddle or yodels the blues
Plays the down beat, off beat, any old beat
A breakdown, a hoedown and does it up neat
She's my bass pickin' baby from Memphis Tennessee

Break (bass)

You'll know when my baby is a comin' to town
All the jive jumpin' jitterbugs they gather around
They keep yellin' to my queenie now honey let's go

You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play
So hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a runnin' on time
But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away

Break (guitar)

Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
That midnight special is burnin' the rail
So woman don't try to follow my tail
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away

Hear her thunder run through the night
That Golden Rocket is doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name
Your fire went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away

Break (fiddle)

That old conductor he seemed to know
You done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song
Said you're worried now but it won't be long
This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind

Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl

And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day

Let me tell you 'bout a new boogie beat
There's no hesitation and it's sweepin' the nation
It's the Rhumba Boogie down the South American way

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga
In her little cabana in old Havana
We were doing the Charleston and Ballin' the Jack
Then that Old Black Bottom till they started the Jitterbug Rag

Then across the water came Cuban Pete
He started the boogie to the rhumba Beat
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's give it a whirl
While he plays the Boogie in the South American style

Break (guitar)

Well you step out together then you circle around
Count one two three then put your right foot down
Then you circle your lady as you swing and you sway
To the Rhumba Boogie in the South American way

When that old piano it starts to ring
Everybody then starts to sing
To the Rhumba Boogie done the tropical style
It's the Rhumba Boogie and they're doin' it all of the while

Well the guy responsible for leadin' the band
He yells do your stuff it's the best in the land
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's dance it a while
To the boogie woogie done the Rhumba Cuban all style

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga
In her little cabana in old Havana
The folks in old Mexico where doin' the tango
And we were steppin' to the rhythm of an old guitar

But I do believe that gal should sit high up in the hall of fame
Until she came along just think what we were missin'
That's why today I'm shouting hooray for the gal who invented kissin'

She thought the fellows how to smooth instead of holdin' hands
And she showed them how to steel a kiss like they do in foreign lands
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
Loved was very nice but as cold as ice to that gal who invented kissin'

She showed the girls how pucker up and roll their pretty eyes
And she showed them how to kiss hello and how to kiss goodbye
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
They could only cook or read a book till that gal who invented kissin'

Mr Edison he invented the lights Mr Bell the telephone
And Columbus found America their names're all well known
But till she came along this world had somethin' missin'
And I'm tellin' you there was nothin' to do till that gal invented kissin'

Now I've been out with a many a gal and the things all were so nice
Some of them I kissed just once and other more than twice
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'

She ever knows how to kiss so fire and how to kiss goodnight
On every kind of hug and kiss she holds a copy rhyme
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'"

Oh don't cause her heartaches and don't bring her shame
Share with her in poverty with her in wealth
For richer for poorer through sickness and health
All these things the Parson did ask me and then
I whispered I do and I'd do it again

Break (steel guitar / fiddle)

For I really love her the one I call wife
And I'll go on caring the rest of my life
I'd die to protect her and she'd do the same
I'd cut off my tongue before I'd bring her shame
We may be in poverty may not have wealth
But we stick together through sickness and health
I'll always be thankful 'til my life is done
That two little words made us both into one"

Can't see honey why you done me wrong
Hard luck sure has got me
I can't sleep a wink
I'll just have to face it from now on

CHORUS:
Sailing o'er the sea of dreams no one cares for me
And we're drifting oh so far apart
You slam the door of love on me
And found a new daddy I could see
By that unwanted sign upon your heart

Break (fiddle)

Seems I'm always on the losing end
Your little game of love was just pretend
I have learned the hard way
It was plain to see
You were nothing more than just a friend

CHORUS:
Never thought you'd treat me so I can't understand
Why you had to tear my world apart
Left me everything to lose
And along with mean old blues
That Unwanted sign upon your heart

Break (steel - fiddle)

Maybe someday that old tide will turn
And your ship will drift on back to me
Then I'll be the captain
You will be the crew
You know how it feels to sit and yearn

CHORUS:
You may think you're doing fine and the world is yours
But you played an unfair game to start
When you learn that love is blind
You'll come back but then you'll find
An unwanted sign upon my heart"

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro

Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day

And the rum is fine any time o' year

Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love thru-out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her.

When I think of her tender lips
Gentle touch of her finger-tips
Reminisce on her eyes so fair
Moonlight soft on her downy hair

I reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love thru-out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her.

If some day I should see her smile
Hold her hand and me heart beguile
Feel her warmth in her earnest prayer
Darling shield me from all despair

Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love thru-out life assure her
If this moment I could Amour her.

Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

And too much in love to break away

Mm-hmm, your father didn't like me, at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide

Though spring is here
To me it's still September

I'll be content, you loved me once in April,
Your lips were warm, and love and spring were new,
But I'm not afraid of autumn, and her sorrow,
For I'll remember,
April and you!

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes,
For flames and love live such a little while

I don't trust you no more
So go knock on another's door
And whose shoulder will you cry on

It's pretty funny, 
But I'm mad about the boy; 
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel 
There's maybe something sad about the boy. 

Walking down the street, 
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet; 
I can't believe it's true, but when I'm blue, 
I some strange way, I'm glad about the boy. 

I'm hardly sentimental, 
Love isn't so sublime, 
I have to pay my rental and I can't afford to waste much time. 

If I could employ 
A little magic that would finally destroy 
This dream that pains me and enchains me, but I can't, 
Because I'm mad about the boy!

Where the people are grand and time is planned
So it's Christmas everyday

'Neath the scotch and soda fountain
There's a treat in store for us guys
Under cigarette trees, we'll take our ease
While the cops fan off the flies

There you will be a lucky sinner
With no conscience for your guide
Each horse you pick will be a winner
And the doors of every bank are open wide

Far across Tomorrow Mountain
There's a life that's fancy and free
On a platinum street we'll plant our feet
It's the land that's fair to see
Won't you hurry there with me?

Just across Tomorrow Mountain
Every girl is Queen of the May
And the kitchens, I'm told are lined with gold
And there ain't no bills to pay

Can't you cross that distant mountain
Where it rains Chanel No.5?
And the gutters, I think are paved with mink
And the diamond bushes thrive

Pigs trot around already roasted
Won't you have a slice of ham?
Marshmallows bloom, already toasted
And the clouds are made of marmalade and jam

Can't you see Tomorrow Mountain?
Can't you watch it glimmer and glow?
It's a wonderful town that's upside down
And it's full of easy dough
Won't you pack your bags and go?"

On the sidewalk on Sunday mornin', don't you know
Lies a body just oozin' life
And someone's sneakin' round the corner
Could that be our boy Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag's just a'droopin' on down
That cement's there, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now MacHeath spends, he spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?

Now Jenny Diver, ho, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town

I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky's back in town
Look out, old Macky's back!!"

Folks are crooning songs soft and low
Needn't tell me so because I know
It's sleepy time down south

Soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees
Folks down there like a life of ease
When old mammy falls upon her knees
It's sleepy time down south

Steamboats on the river a coming or a going
Splashing the night away
Hear those banjos ringing, the people are singing
They dance til the break of day, hey

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Takes me back there where I belong
How I'd love to be in my mammy's arms
When it's sleepy time way down south

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Take me back there where I belong
How I'd love to be in my mammy's arms

And another and another

When she turned on the radio
I could hear the music
Playing soft and low

I said, we better dance
Before I flip my lid
We both got up to dance
But we never did

Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another

I thought the night was young
Until I saw the clock
The clock was striking midnight
It was quite a shock

I started for the door
But she grabbed my sleeve
She put her arms around me
Man, I couldn`t leave

He knew they were strangers that came from the town
Men he had never seen before

Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no, he cried, dear God don't let it be
They can't take my sweetheart away

I know Dad that you don't understand
How a heart so young could conceive a plan
I'm only seven now but it's just like you said
Daddy someday I'll be a man

He told me it'd have to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done

Went down that Georgia Line

And The cab went by at nine

Till she came to her own father's door

Father, dear father, she cried
Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms, will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor

But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of her voice, did he hear
So the watch dog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor

Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door, the next mornin'
And he found Mary dead, but the child still alive
Closely grasping his dead mother's arms

In grief the old man passed away
And the child to it's mother went soon
And no one they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage to ruin has gone

But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows grew over the door
Saying there Mary died, once the gay village bride
From the wind that blow across the wild moor"

158,The Platters,Only You,TRSMAVC128F930E22E,1956,"Only you can make all this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand
I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand
I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

One and only you"
159,Tommy Makem,The Cobbler,TRMXYKG128F4225120,1956,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler
I served my time at ould camp
Some call me an old agitator
But now I'm resolved to repent

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-doe
With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy
And me lab stone keeps beating away

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing
My mother was burned for a witch
My sister's a dandy house-keeper
And I'm a mechanical switch

It's forty long years I have traveled
All by the contents of me pack
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers
I carry them all on me back

Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy
Me wife she's the devil, she's cracked
And no matter what I may do with her
Her tongue, it goes clickety-clack

It was early one fine summer's morning
A little before it was day
I dipped her three times in the river
And carelessly bade her ""Good day"""
160,Willie Dixon,Crazy For My Baby,TRTLDUD128F148CEBB,1956,"I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
And my baby's just as crazy for me

Everytime I lay down to sleep
I dream my baby is kissing me
The sweet little girl well she's so fine
I just can't get her out of my mind

I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
And my baby's just as crazy for me

When the sun go down she can hear me shout
I know she will be home before the lights go out
Early in the morning about the break of day
I can hear nothing but my baby say

I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
And my baby's just as crazy for me

She held me long and she squeeze me tight
She make me love her with all my might
She bring my food right to them bed
She talk baby talk tailing out of my head

I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
I'm crazy for my baby
And my baby's just as crazy for me"
161,Willie Dixon,Walking The Blues,TRJQHHH128F148CECA,1956,"Man, slow down
we'll get there
take your time
don't walk so fast
stay on the road
I don't blame people
saying ""walking the blues""

walking the blues
'cause man, this is it

Now I think I'll relax
that's the way to relax
Now watch this

Man, is it hot today!
All you gotta do is put 
one foot in the front of the other
And keep on walking
Walking the blues
That's what I call glidin' low

I hope my old lady is home
when I get there
All this walking
I don't mean my mother-in-law
I mean my wife
My mother-in-law
she's always there
so we'll just keep on walking anyway"
