0,Big Bill Broonzy,Long Tall Mama,TRRUFQA128F934A70C,1934,"Got a long tall mama
She stands about seven feet nine
And when she get to loving
Holler papa won't you take your time

Oh when she start to loving
She sure can do her stuff
And she squeezing so tight
Holler mama lordy that's enough

Got a brand new movement
One that she calls her own
And when she start to kissing
Make a poor man leave his home

And she do a little of this
And mama and she do a little of that
And when she put on full steam
Make a freight train jump a track

Said she's long and tall
And half as sweet as she can be
To satisfy that woman
Takes more than a bumblebee"
1,Charley Patton,34 Blues,TRDXVNB12903CF14FF,1934,"I ain't gonna tell nobody, '34 have done for me
I ain't gonna tell nobody what, '34 have done for me
Christmas rolled up, I was broke as I could be

They run me from Will Dockery's, Took me from Herman Jett's Job
They run me from Will Dockery's, Took me from Herman Jett's Job
Spoken: Buddy, what's the matter?
Herman told papa Charley
""I don't want you hangin' round on my job no more""

Fella, down in the country, it almost make you cry
Fella, down in the country, it almost make you cry
Spoken: My God, children
Women and children flaggin' freight trains for rides

Herman got a little six Buick, big six Chevrolet car
Herman got a little six Buick, little six Chevrolet car
Spoken: My God, what solid power
And it don't do nothin' but, follow behind Harvey Parker's plow

And it may bring sorrow, Lord, it may bring tears
It may bring sorrow, Lord, and it may bring tears
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, let me see your brand new year"
2,Duke Ellington & His Orchestra,Solitude,TRRAZUA128F933E5B9,1934,"In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
Alternative lyric:
In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die
I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad
In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love"
3,Ethel Waters,Moonglow,TRWYRVL12903D0EBC3,1934,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you"
4,Kokomo Arnold,Milk Cow Blues,TRQZQPG128F930525A,1934,"Well I woke up this mornin'
Looked outdoors
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she lows
If you see my milk cow
Please drive her on home
Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since that cows been gone

Well you gotta treat me right honey
Day by Day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down upon your knees and pray
Cause you're gonna need me
You're gonna need my help someday
Lord you're gonna be sorry
Ou, you treated me this a way
Aw, now take it away boys

Sail on, Sail on, Sail on little gal, Sail on
Sail on, Sail on, Sail on little gal, Sail on
You're gonna keep right on sailing
Till you lose your happy home

Well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
I said well good evening
Don't that sun look good going down
Don't that ol' army cot look lonely
When your lover ain't no place around

Well I tried everything baby
To get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you
What I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop my cryin'
Gonna leave you alone
And if you don't think I'm leavin' big momma
Just count the days I'm gone
You ain't gonna see me
You ain't gonna see my sweet face no more

Lord you gonna be wondering honey
Where in this world I've gone"
5,Kokomo Arnold,Old Original Kokomo Blues,TROZOWG128F427FBDF,1934,"One and one is two, mama

When you first fell across my bed
You been drinkin' your ole bad whiskey
And talkin' all out your head
Cryin', oooh, baby don't you want to go
Back to the Eleven Light City
To sweet old Kokomo

I don't drink because I'm dry, mama

6,Leroy Carr,Mean Mistreater Mama,TRFEAGF12903CD4288,1934,"You're a mean mistreating mama, and you don't mean me no good
You're a mean mistreating mama, and you don't mean me no good
And I don't blame you baby, I'd be the same way if I could

You say you're going to leave me, well you say you going away
You say you're going to leave me, well you say you going away
That's all right baby, maybe you'll come back home some day

Now you're a mean mistreater, and you mistreats me all the time
Now you're a mean mistreater, and you mistreats me all the time
Now I tried to love you, swear but you won't pay that no mind

Can you remember mama, in the morning I knocked upon your door
Can you remember mama, in the morning I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me, that you didn't want me no more

Ain't it lonesome, sleeping all by yourself
Ain't it lonesome, sleeping all by yourself
When the one that you love, is loving someone else"
7,Tampa Red,Black Angel Blues,TRCBRRJ12903D12010,1934,"I got a sweet little angel
I like the way she spread her wings
Got a sweet little angel
I like the way she spread her wings
When she spreads them over me
She brings joy in ev'rything

Well, I love my little angel
Better than I love myself
I love my little angel
Better than I love myself
I don't want my little angel
To fall in love with no one else

If my little angel should quit me
I believe that I will die
If my angel should quit me
I believe that I will die
An if my little angel don't love me, Ransom
Ooo!
Well, I can't see the reason why

'You know what, boy?'

Asked her for a nickle
She give me a twenty dollar bill
Asked my angel for a nickle
She give me a twenty dollar bill
I asked her for a drink a-whiskey
Woo!
That woman bought me a liquor still."
8,Tampa Red,Mean Mistreater Blues,TROADRE128F429FABB,1934,"You's a mean mistreating mama : and you don't mean me no good
But I don't blame you baby : I'd be the same way if I could

You say you going to leave me : well you say you going away
But that's all right baby : baby you'll come back home some day

Now you's a mean mistreater : and you mistreat me all the time
But that's all right baby : I won't pay that no mind

Can't you remember baby : when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me : that you didn't want me no more

Boys ain't it lonesome : sleeping all by yourself
When the woman that you loving : is loving someone else"
