0,Papa Charlie Jackson,Airy Man Blues,TRLOZBM128F4280BF6,1924,"Now, look here, Mr. Bill, says you think you've been sharp
You know Miss Delinah done broke your heart
She put you out, she told you to go
To never come back to her house no more
So now you're here, tryin' to throw me down
You know you're the worst new man in town
You keep on talkin' and you surely will
Says, you'll never get the ten dollar bill

REFRAIN: Oh, you can keep on talkin', little darling babe
But don't need no airy man
I want these browns at Illinois as trained
To thoroughly understand
That you can bring in my wood, you can bring in my coal
You can iron my shirts, you can bless my soul
You can get yourself together, you can be out with the weather
I don't need no airy man

Now, there was an old lady and her husband, they took a
Stroll just the other day
She walked all out on State Street, just to
Pass the time away
Said, she walked into the hop shop, darling, babe, and
These are the words she say
She's gonna smoke a rope of hop, a-gonna drink her tea
""Tell the Chin'man bring me hop for me""

Oh, you can keep on talkin', little darling babe
But don't need no airy man
I want these browns at Illinois as trained
To thoroughly understand
That you can bring in my wood, you can bring in my coal
You can iron my shirts, you can bless my soul
You can get yourself together, you can be out with the weather
I don't need no airy man

Oh, you can keep on talkin', little darling babe
But don't need no airy man
I want these browns at Illinois as trained
To thoroughly understand
That you can bring in my wood, you can bring in my coal
You can iron my shirts, you can bless my soul
You can get yourself together, you can be out with the weather
I don't need no airy man"
1,Vernon Dalhart,Wreck Of The Old 97,TRZCBEO128F4285118,1924,"They gave him his orders
At Monroe, Virginia
Sayin' Pete you're way behind time
This is not '38, but its old '97
You must put her into Spencer on time

He looked round an' said
To his black, greasy fireman
Jus' shove on in a lil' more coal
And when we cross that wide old mountain
You can watch old '97 roll

It's a mighty rough road
From Lynchburg to Danville
In a line on a three mile grade
It was on that grade
That he lost his airbrake
And you see what a jump he made

He was goin' down the grade
Makin' ninety miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck
With his hand on the throttle
And a scalded to death by the steam

Now ladies you must take warnin'
From this time now and on
Never speak harsh words
To your true love and husband
He may leave you and never return"
2,Vernon Dalhart,The Prisoner's Song,TRTRZWN128F4285110,1924,"Oh, I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
Oh, I wish I had someone to live with
'Cause I'm tired of livin' alone

Oh, please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told

I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
Leavin' my poor darlin' alone
With the cold prison bars all around me
And my head on a pillow of stone

Now I have a grand ship on the ocean
All mounted with silver and gold
And before my poor darlin' would suffer
Oh, that ship would be anchored and sold

Now if I had wings like an angel
Over these prison walls I would fly
And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darlin'
And there I'd be willin' to die"
