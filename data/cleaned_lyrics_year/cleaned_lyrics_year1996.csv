0,Jan & Dean,Surfin' Safari,TRWQJPM128F934B7F1,1996,"Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with...)

Early in the morning we'll be startin' out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody
With our boards inside
And headin' out singing our song

Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari)with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari)with me

Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with...)

At Huntington and Malibu
They're shooting the pier
At Rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go

Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me

Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with...)

They're anglin' in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Dohini too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru

Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me

Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with...)

With me

1,My Dying Bride,It Will Come,TRGZAFU128F422AD8D,1996,"The sun will die,
On us tonight.
The days are gone,
For everyone.

The holy cry
Forever night
What have we done?
Who killed the sun?

We will be on our knees
The time has come
Thy will be done
Holy men pray
Return the day
For our souls

How can we fight,
This endless night?
Oh, lord Jesus,
Will you save us?"
2,Ayreon,The Dawn Of Man,TRQCXWI128F930AEF6,1996,"OKKIE HUYSDENS:
More than a million years ago,
It came to earth out of the sky.
From whence it came is yet unknown,
And still we don't know why.

EDWARD REEKERS:
Way beyond infinity,
Where time is lost, 
And life has ceased to be 

OKKIE HUYSDENS: And life has ceased to be.

EDWARD REEKERS:
There's a cosmic entity,
A bringer of life,
For all eternity.

Is this how it all began?
The dawn of man.

OKKIE HUYSDENS: 
More than a million miles from earth,
Somewhere in outer space.
Behold a planetary birth,
Making way for a brand new race.

ROBERT SOETERBOEK:
Way beyond infinity.

OKKIE HUYSDENS:
Where time is lost,
And life has ceased to be,
And life has ceased to be.

3,Dimmu Borgir,Alt lys er svunnet hen,TRTCVCG128F425223E,1996,"Glinsende månelys ovenfor driver
Frostlagte stier viser vei
Svarte sjeler farer henover natten
Inn gjennom skodde heim

Alt har svartnet
Alt lys er svunnet hen
Lødig trer vi nå inn i Riket
I minne om at våre spor blir fulgt

Omgitt av sorgens dis
Skrider ferden frem
Som en skare av likkledde skrømt
Vandrer vi jervens hjem

Brisen fører oss over norske myrer
Forbi hver en tåkegrend
Med hatet i våre harme sinn
Reiser vi for aldri å komme igjen"
4,Movetron,Vanha suola,TRAFLWG128F93446D4,1996,"Kai lapsia me vielä vain oltiin kun
Ensisuudelman mulle sä annoit
Se mikä puolitiehen meiltä jäi silloin
Ei tänä yönä jää kesken sen vannoit

Vie mut luokse rakkauden laivan
Sieltä tunteet matkaan mä laitan
Nostan purjeet, tuulen kun huomaan,
Mä ihollain, niin kuuman

Mikä meidät yhteen toi taas, en tiedä
Vain kosketuksesi mä tunnen, se riittää
Ei, tätä yötä ei meiltä voi viedä
Sen sinä tahdot sydämeeni kai piirtää

Vie mut luokse rakkauden laivan
Sieltä tunteet matkaan mä laitan
Nostan purjeet, tuulen kun huomaan,
Mä ihollain, niin kuuman

5,Steve Earle,Ellis Unit One,TRRLHRV128F92E225F,1996,"I was fresh out of the service
It was back in '82
I raised some Cain when I come back to town
I left to be all I could be
Come home without a clue
Now, I married Dawn and had to settle down

So I hired on at the prison
Guess I always knew I would
Just like my dad and both my uncles done
And I worked on every cell block now
'N things were goin' good
But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One

Swing low
Swing low
Swing low and carry me home

Well, my daddy used to talk about them long nights at the walls
And how they used to strap 'em in the chair
The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer 'n all
'N when the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air

Well, folks just got too civilized
Sparky's gatherin' dust
'Cause no one wants to touch a smokin' gun
And since they got the injection
They don't mind as much, I guess
They just put 'em down at Ellis Unit One

Swing low
Swing low
Swing low and carry me home

Well, I've seen 'em fight like lions, boys
I've seen 'em go like lambs
And I've helped to drag 'em when they could not stand
And I've heard their mamas cryin' when they heard that big door slam
And I've seen the victim's family holdin' hands

Last night I dreamed that I woke up with straps across my chest
And something cold and black pullin' through my lungs
'N even Jesus couldn't save me though I know he did his best
But he don't live on Ellis Unit One

Swing low
Swing low
Swing low and carry me home
Swing low
Don't let go
Swing low and carry me home"
6,Journey,Castles Burning,TRRCHPB128F42B2FCE,1996,"Jimmy wanted her the moment that she stumbled his way 
With a cocktail in her hand, she knew how she'd win the game 
There were beautiful in all the right places 
She keeps her rendezvous with soup opera faces 
She started rumors that were driving him crazy 
He couldn't stop the things they'd say 

And they live for, passion, love and pain 
In a rage of jealousy and fame 
And they watch their dreams go up on flames 

Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Wo... burnin'... 

In the kingdom of pretenders love is not what it seems 
Jimmy cried and then he punished her 
No one heard her scream 
On the outside, it's all crimson and clover 
On the inside, they know it's over 

And the band of lawyers that steal the show 
As they watch their world go up in smoke 

Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Wo... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'... burnin'... 

(Spoken words) 
When we return a story of a 5 alarm fire 
Late last night in the prestigious Hollywood hills 
Where one of the most controversial marriages in the 
Entertainment industry went up in smoke, arson is suspected 
It is still under investigation... 

You know I love you, you know you're my girl, 
I'd never hurt you... no 

Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Castles burning... in the dead of night 
Burnin'... burnin' 

All is fair in love and war, but war is hell... 
In the heart of the night, in the middle of the big bad city"

9,FRANK T,Soy Un Poeta,TRRMECA12903CC385F,1996,"Soy un poeta, soy un macho
no me llamo Nacho
me gusta el gazpacho
si tengo un bocata, yo te doy un cacho
si yo fuera gitano te llamaría chacho
no bebo alcohol, no soy un borracho
aunque a veces bebo sidra y cuarenta y tres.
Escucha cómo canto
yo soy un santo
yo soy más santo que el mismo Papa
la peña se rapa
la rima no se escapa
si hablas demasiado, te callo con mi grapa.
Con una grapa sólo se grapa
pero con un boli nunca se boliapa.
Sólo con un boli se puede escribir
rimas de poetas como las que vas a oír.

Hago este verso
para que tú estés inmerso
y sueñes con eso
soñar con lo extenso.
Yo predico de poemas reales
también irreales
y confusionales.
Están en mi mente
lo paso a la gente
y cuando me veas, párate detente.
Háblame, salúdame
y si quieres en los pies bésame.
Si esta poesía se pudiera vender
costaría un dinero que no podrías ni comprender.
Todo el dinero del estado americano
multiplícalo por mil y todavía se queda enano.
Qué curioso, es grandioso
saber que lo que haces es glorioso

Prefiero comer chuletas
antes que ver las tetas
de esas paletas
que sólo son ineptas.
Las pobres chiquillas no tienen conciencia
entre ellas y las putas no hay diferencia.
Clítoris llenos de semen de toyacos
biguarras tus hijos serán monicacos.
Tenéis que cuidaros
tenéis que sentaros
poner mi música y culturizaros.
No soy un poeta ni tampoco un escritor
eso dije antes en otra canción.
Mentía, mis posibilidades no veía
ahora ya sé cuál es mi filosofía
y ¿cuál es?
comer y la tripa llenar
ir al servicio y dentro cagar.
¡Oh! qué placer cuando llegas al fin
mi filosofía de cacafutiscín.
Es imposible contradecirla
es imposible, no quieras maldecirla.
Tú haces caca
él hace caca
todos cagamos
y los poetas rimamos.

10,Fountains Of Wayne,You Curse At Girls  (LP Version),TRQMQTS128E0787422,1996,"They say
You curse at girls.
Don't you know it isn't right?
You could get yourself in trouble..
You've been 
Livin in a different world.
Lookin' for another fight.
Sifting through emotional rubble.

Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue

Each time you curse at girls
You curse a little at yourself
Don't you know a girl gets angry?

Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue

They say you curse at girls
Don't you know it isn't right?"
11,Lunar Aurora,Conqueror of the ember Moon,TRFKHPK128F92D6889,1996,"The night has come to conquer the ember moon
The night has come to drown in the black heart's desire
Voices enter the root of thoughts and take them into the nocturnal void
Withered hands hold the chalice of the mysteries dripping down the tongue
The night's second face one step behind the beautiful caress
Cold flames lacerate, crawling up the flesh and soul
until the candles of pain enlighten the entirety
A writhing soul in the gruesome hands of the burning moon
Trapped in the shroud of an innocent dream
Shivering in moondrunk ecstasy when beauty reveals its cruelty
a craving scythes the fetters of blood
ember fires feast upon the fetters of light
when cruelty reveals its morbid beauty
The gates await unlocked to a realm beyond divinity
The steps only follow one way, the path towards sanity's end
the thoughts descend into their tombs vanished is the name of pain
Tears rise in the shadow's sleep
Veil all those feeble wounds of a blinding sense
nothing is what it seemed to be remaining as a frozen dream
somewhere behind the shadow's veil
Revelation of the morbid throne
Conqueror of the unbegotten spark, the cursed seed
The night has come to enter the spiritual crafts
The night has come to unveil another sight
The night has come to unleash the craving
Do you feel the source that fills the chalice
with the wine with mesmerizing strenght ?
Conqueror of the Ember Moon
Harvester in the gardens of desolation
Feel that pain bears more than pain
when the eye catches the candle and not its light."
12,Steve Earle,Poor Boy   (Album Version),TRAEUEE12903CEF61B,1996,"I was born on the other side of town
Everybody over there just puts me down
I never thought about it much, 'til the first time I saw you
Uh-oh, what's a poor boy gonna do

It's bad enough to love you from afar
Me down here and you up where you are
If you hadn't given me that look, that's all it took, it's true
Uh-oh, what's a poor boy gonna do

Baby what's a poor boy got, not a heck of a lot
Just a heart that's true
One thing he sure doesn't need is a heart that bleeds
And these lovesick blues

I know a poor boy can't go far
Baby, maybe someday drive your car
I can look in my rearview, into those eyes of blue
Uh-oh what's a poor boy gonna do"
13,Robert Forster,On A Street Corner,TRMCAKF128F149320F,1996,"It was on a street corner
In my hometown
That's when I first saw you and I regret that
Day now

There was sun on that morning
As I lay in my single bed
The bed at the back of the family home
Those yellow curtains over my head
Black shoes and old jeans
A favourite shirt of faded blue
Blue, blue, blue

That's what I had on
The day I first saw you
That's what I was wearing
The day I first saw you

And baby tell me
What childhood crime
Made you so narrow
So hard all the time
Your old lines your harshness
Of what others should do
I did not know
What hit me when I came 
To know you
I did not know
What hit me when I came
To know you

The city was beneath me then
It was glittering like a star
Throwing up its suggestions
Of who it thinks you are
Who it thinks that you are
And what it thinks you could be
Could be, could be, could be

That's how it was
The day you walked past me
That's how it was
The day you passed me

And baby tell me
What is it like
To always be so narrow
And always so right
To carry your fury
And to always lay it down
I did not know
About these things
In my hometown

It was on a street corner
And I regret that day now"
14,Mindy McCready,Tell Me Something I Don't Know,TRNSDIG128F42906DE,1996,"(Tim Johnson/David Malloy)

You say that you don't love me, well that's no mystery
I can feel it in your kisses and the way you look at me
You say lately you been thinking that it's time for you to go
Tell me something I don't know

'Cause I can't figure out why it all fell apart
And I don't have a clue just how I lost your heart
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me something I don't know

You say you've found someone who makes you feel alive
She made you a promise to love you for all time
Well, boy, I found your shoebox, I read the letters that she wrote
So tell me something I don't know

'Cause I can't figure out why it all fell apart
And I don't have a clue just how I lost your heart
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me something I don't know

I don't know what it's like to lie alone at night and toss and turn
And when it comes to pain it's plain to see I've got a lot to learn
So make me understand why I still need you so
And tell me how to let you go

And tell me something I don't know
And tell me something I don't know"
15,Donna Lewis,Fools Paradise ( LP Version ),TRWVMPF128F427D425,1996,"Manipulated romance
pretty speeches in the dark
banging on your big drum
you captivate their hearts
but underneath the mask
is a man of straw
a master of excuses 
closing every door

I don't wanna hear your name
I don't wanna feel your pain
I don't have to play your game
I'm stronger things have changed
I'm no longer in fools, fools paradise
I'm no longer in fools, fools paradise
fools paradise

Your poetic inspiration
is a work of art 
but your obsession with the glory
rules a self-centered heart 
accumulative hatred 
living in fear
and when the bitterness is over 
another victim reappears

So I don't wanna hear your name
I don't wanna feel your pain
I don't have to play your game
I'm stronger things have changed
I'm no longer in fools, fools paradise

I don't wanna hear your name

Tonight, you're waiting and I wanna fly

Everyone knows me but I've never shown my love
Soon as I saw you something awoke
I got by without your love

Because cutting through the crap is my speciality
Like a bomb I'm dropping yes a ton of lead
You're trying to figure out the last thing I said
I'm a redwood I love to be a tree yes I'm a druid
My words are flowing out like a fluid
Never give in never conform
I'll be bustin' out rhymes in a triplet form

Dead leaves on the trees in spring
Can't hear the birds sing
A light powdered snow on the ground is glistening
Vipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver
A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver
While I doze I suppose I could get lost
With a brownskin friend claiming kin to crazy horse
I stink of vino my greasy clothes are rancid but
I tip the bottle back the spirits are in me kid

Fire water call it liquid rapture
Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature
Fire water the world's a mixture
Of broken liquored people get the picture
Fire water call it liquid rapture
Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature
Fire water the world's a mixture
Of broken liquored people get the picture

Whiskey be spittle at the corners of my mouth
I'm rather liquored light flickers
I got the shakes and jitters
I roll I'm like raging bull bumrushin' the show
Hand to my head sway in the fire I've waded into
All alone except for the whiskey voices
Whores laught neon signs flash other choices


I stagger stumble to toast the past while I mumble
Slur my song slow porno show marquee words crumble

Fire water call it liquid rapture

Fire water call it liquid rapture
Into the flash and flames of my crazy nature
Fire water the world's a mixture
Of broken liquored people get the picture

You're hangin' around the house with all your friends
Steady drinking smoking the green weed
And head is sort of blinking
You're going with the flow
And everybody is getting plowed
The voices and the music and the noise is getting loud
You got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around
So you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown
Only nineteen but you know where you can get it
So you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting
By about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead
You really can't remember who was the one that said
Let's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck
He's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up
Ten minutes later the whole vibe had changed
You try for conversation
But you know you're acting strange
Your eyes are wide open but your smile is gone
You just keep fiending 'til the f**king break of dawn

A crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver

Such superficial optimism a deepness not so pure,
Anesthetic presence with an undefined concern,
With images so glorified but still where is our cure.
Give! Where's your fire?
Movements definition unclear amid definite crises,
Retreating carelessly with persuasions that seem to never end,
And must immarilty become so monumental before we see?
Give! Where's your fire?
Out my face! Out my face!
Pseudo-intellectual moderate steppin' to dis,
And you say that my concerns don't burn with validity,
Trying to check me got nothing to prove ""be"",
On with the privilege shit-talking blood of my people your mocking,
If it came down to dying I would see that ass running,
Say full belly-buster you willing to suffer and put your ass on the line and fool help me gets mine!

There's the rockabilly cats with their pomps real high
Wearin' black drape coats, all real gone guys
Cool skinheads with their rolled-up jeans
Lookin' real tough and mighty mean

There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

They sew fishhooks under their collars
They got razors in their shoes
I said, ""Go cat go,"" their battle cry
World War III is startin' to brew

Now the skinheads all use blackjacks
And they're lookin' mighty mean
They got chains wrapped around their fingers
And their heads are all shaved clean

There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

Well, there ain't a man left standin'
So let's all go get a beer
No team is a winner
So we'll see you all next year

There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight

Rumble in Brighton tonight
Rumble on the beach tonight
Rumble in Brighton tonight
Rumble on the beach tonight

There ain't a damn thing that the cops can do
Line right up for a sideline view
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight"

I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning, I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows... fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree I really look good in black... fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise

Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anutter
Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night, scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise"

I love my boss
He isn't full of fluff and gloss
He gives me work and many chores to do
My model, like Ben Cartwright to Hoss

And though he pays me minimum wage
It's all I deserve at this stage
Some union hack said I should ask for more
I answered with suitable rage

I love my boss
I love my boss
I love my boss
I love my boss

One day I came to work too late
I'd had a Früvous luncheon date
My boss he summoned me to speak with him
I sweated, awaiting my fate
He said ""you're done!""
He chased me two blocks with a gun
But my dear boss let me apologize
In hindsite, there wasn't a gun.

(Mike)
He's going out now with my sister
They go real heavy on the sauce
I'd like to tell him watch out mister
But he's the boss
My friends they say that I am clinging
Ask why I'm carrying this cross
Who knows what club-med will be bringing 
From dear old boss

They're the ones who make it move
Bewitched would have an empty plate

Speak the name Reuben Kincaid

like confetti on the desert wind.
Phoenix rises - proud young wings reflecting amber.
Solitary.
Untouchable.
Excited, and ready to search for his rose.
But the flight lasted so long
and those powerful wings grew weary as he padded through blind alleys,
swooped open-eyed into blind curves
and wasted night after lonely night trying to drink from a mirage.
But no distraction could decimate the totality of belief,
and his number came up just when the weight of his despair had him pinned to a rock;
when the feathers of his wings had been shed
and he stood naked before a disapassionate ocean of grey faces.
His precious twin. His rose.
Isolde dancing alone, then multiplying, inviting...so many many levels.
And the crippled soul unites and prepares for the long journey home"

Just like Sinbad I sailed my vessel true
Fled like Popeye from the Island of the Goon
Till her song, well it lured me off course
I think it came from the ocean floor

Chorus:
Rip off all my limbs
Poke out both my eyes
Pull out my swollen tongue
Wear a thin disguise
And the Sirens' song
Sweetly sucks me down
Into the ocean blue
I'll find my way back to you

Can't be bothered with the natural fact
I guess she's gone and she ain't comin' back
Been at the sea for forty days and forty nights
Let her go without any fight

There she stands knee deep
At the ocean shore
Waves her arms like a matador
Like a matador of course
She's an East coast mama now
I know that for sure
And I'm going down for the third time
Going down the third

Down - Down - Down

He makes a list of all his favourite friends
Then leaves his footprints on the steps that shine
With tears that he has wept again... and again...

He bought his clothes from a skateboard boutique
Hung around in places where nobody speaks
Got on line to an internet club
Played Trivial Pursuits with the Goddess of Love

And counted his imaginary friends, got up to ten,
Lost count and then went out to walk the streets
'Til God know when.

He met a girl who liked a bit of a laugh,
He gained the youth he'd forgotten to have.

Often get mistaken for interesting people

I don't think my souls on fire
I just need another drink,
Because it's easy to believe when
You don't have to think.
To die for you my friend well that's
A fantasy come true for you.
And I'm looking for what I can't get.

See I've fucked up and sucked up
And lucked out. I know that.
I was the apple of your eye.
I know that.
But if I asked you to stay
You'd just say no.
This is how I feel,
This is not how I feel."

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.

And some help from above
From your heart to mine

There's a land of justice, cities filled with pride
A mountain of hope, just on the other side

Across a river of indifference, and a valley of despair
There's a tower of courage, piercing through the air
I have a dream for our children, I want to take them there

And we are building the bridge
One small stone at a time

As we learn to forgive
When we open up our minds
When our words are true and kind

only to test, to poke and see

you know the history about this clique bitch
oh, what, you don't want me to call you slut?
then why you fucking all them niggers letting them all up in your guts
but see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even

And hold on to your head""

Little blood red Riding Hood was passing through the woods
A basket full of poisoned fruit
She's absolutely way to cute

And it's way past her deadtime...the night has just died

Good Old Nick is in her blood and it makes me feel so hot
Devil eyes, that's no surprise, she's colder than ice
The werewolf is hiding with its yellow glowing eyes
Drooling for some baby blood, he's jumping in the night
And he knows where Red is riding
He knows here Grandma well
That big bad werewolf's got it down, he cannot fail

And it's way past her deadtime...the night has just died

Grandma's waiting in here dead for sweetest little Red
When she ate the werewolf's head, you could not even tell

There is no way out for sweetest little Riding Hood

Because they know the truth to tell
Sorrow is the name of their song
The memory lives on
The spirit of the green man has gone

Bare your teeth

And is that blood or lipstick

You cut deep with sorrow
You carve it with disdain

And come to think of it, how does she know?
Her doubt is just her faith in disappointment,
She can't be blamed if she decides to go.

Her dignity is what makes her an angel,
You know she needs it more than she needs you,
It doesn't pay to take these things for granted,
Something which you always seem to do,
You always seem to do.

But she just wants to spend some time with you,
Just a minute, or just a moment,
Just long enough to throw one clean punch.

Now you've reached the point where she sees through you,
Your low-esteem and lack of self-control,
Everything she had she handed to you,
And what she didn't give you, you stole,
You couldn't have so you stole.

Sometimes I stop to question it all,
Must I look at the stars and live in the dirt?
When all I have to show for my doubt is a blow to the lip,
And some blood on my shirt."

How it hurt to see those shadows on the wall
They were kissin' like true lovers always do
Right then and there I knew that we were through
So I turned and walked away broken hearted to this day
All because of those two shadows on the wall

Not a tear came to my eyes I was hurt too much to cry
By the faithful kiss of shadows on the wall
Now I know the misery of living with the memory
Of that night I saw those shadows on the wall

To be haunted by the shadows on the wall"

To flow through me

Drown your sorrows in prayer 
But your prayers will never change the world 
I separate myself 
From those who chase the spirit 
I can't fall to my knees 
And pretend like all the rest 
This is a soul that doesn't need saving 

Their paradise not mine; an illusion I will not believe 
Divine presence of perfection, turns sour in my gaze 
Why should I feel compassion for the suffering of your God 
For all the pain he allows, I give him what he deserves

In the name of the Son 
Where is the Holy Spirit, I feel nothing 
As I stare upon the crucifix, I feel nothing for a God I never knew 
I refuse to embrace, and live by his word 

I take not of his body 
I take not of his blood 
I don't need salvation 
Or his forgiveness 
I don't want his kingdom 
My kingdom is here"
64,Abbey Lincoln,Tender As A Rose,TRCAHML128F92FDED9,1996,"She was as tender as a rose
She was as soft as snowy down
And from her head down to her toes
She was a dream that hung around

She was as fresh as april
Warm as may
And all the fellas threw their hearts away
But all of her lovin was Joe's she was as tender as a rose

I guess that Joe was pretty sick
His feelings went from cold to hot
Her love to him was just a kick
His ego needed her a lot



And when he took her  away she wore a smile
Fate crossed its fingers for that lovely child
Cause all of her lovin' was Joe's
She was as tender as a rose

She came back walking all alone
She wasn't gone for very long
She came back with a heart of stone
We knew that everything had gone wrong

And when you ask her why she's out each night
She'll say,  ""Brother, once I tried to be right
once all of my loving was Joe's
I was as tender as a rose.""
She was as tender as a rose"

We dance the electric Pagan Love Song
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Eating dead flowers bleeding in a strange daze
I was cutting throats and eating tears
Smiling in a ruined age
Douse my love everything with gasoline
Grave flower blooms at your red light death scene
We dance the electric Pagan Love Song
We hunt with the children paling in the catacombs
Trippin' on real blood in strange sunshine
Have you felt such weight upon your eyes
Sister I been trippin' in your sky
I woke up adrift in a Technicolor bliss
Ten million miles high
I'm a Christian zombie by daylight
Satan, he come trippin' 'round midnight
Circle jerkin' redneck truckers' dream
You scream, I scream
Everybody screams for morphine
I won't love you, mama, I just fiend your morphine... your morphine
We send, the love, to the skull
I am the mother, the father, the killer
Forever and ever all right
I am the shapeless, the deathless, remorseless

Stark flesh sinks through the freezing liquid darkness. Pale

Trying to make a life of fabricated lies

I was only seven when my family was deceased
Just a skinny bugger, but the crowd wants a feast
They all took a bite, there's nothing left at least
That's how it seems to the brides of the beast

The sudden thud, the spurt of blood
The sound of crunching bone
Bring me your blood tonight at ten [2x]
I'm falling in love with myself again

Said I was responsible for other people's lives
Said that I was lethal with guns and clubs and knives
But I knew they belonged to me
Each one was my bride
None of them went quietly, each one gave his cry"

I met a girl on the beach with a tan of golden brown hair and long hair.
We fell in love, she was a gift from the salty air.
I couldn't imagine the day she would leave my life.

Oh God, my love is like ice cream,
The Summer sunshine melts it away.
I'm so stupid, was it a dream?
It's a bitter memory,
Summer of love.

Not only love, but everything I do has gone like this.
Why's that? So many, many shitty things, I don't have the thing I really love.
I say I don't mind, but I really just pretend not to care.
Life is long, so I can't cry all the time.
Summer of love, summer of love, summer of love..."

Mama, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Well, worries and trouble, darling
Babe, you know I've had my share

""Tell me what's wrong child,
You didn't eat enough
To keep a bird alive,
And you haven't said
Two words to me all evening.""

She said,
""Girl, you've got your long face on,
Your eyes are red,
And your smile is gone.""
So I broke down,
And I told my mama the reason.

I'm in love and he's in Dallas.
I'm as blue as a girl can be.
Is he down there thinkin' about my love,
Or driftin' away from me?
I'm in love and he's in Dallas
But that's not the way it's s'pposed to be.
Can a promise reach from Texas
All the way to Tennesee?

I really shoulda heard
From him by now,
He promised he'd write
When things settled down.
And send me money
For a ticket when things got better.

And mama I guess
He's just workin' hard
And you know how
Those cowboys are.
But it's been three weeks
And I ain't got a letter.

I'm in love and he's in Dallas,

Get down, rise up, hold on to the vibe
Move to the left, to the right, attraction, rejection
The floor we dance on is the firmament of our eyes
Creation transcends creator
Yes is the word to everything
To pain, to torture, to war and destruction
Choose, make up your mind before after is no more
Time stops while another time is coming
The same leads back to the same
Present is the time including all times
Each second is eternity as eternity is now
And now is forever...
Yes is the word to everything
To liberty, to sweetness, to peace and construction
Move with the stars, with the wave and with us
Dance to the thunder beats, feel it all around

You gotta keep on looking now
Keep on looking now

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

Where your walk it's always shadow
Conversation always shallow
When they talk they never look you in the eye
They look over your shoulder
To faces even colder
And you feel a little older
Every time

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

When you're looking for reaction
When you're searching for direction
When you're scared of rejection
Or attack
You need the warmth of loving
When you're growing tired of seeing
A colourless reflection
Looking back

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

Something real to fill those little empty spaces
So you're looking for love in all the wrong places

You need understanding
You need a home
All those people so alone
You need understanding
You need a home
All those people so alone

You're looking for love
In all the wrong places
You're looking for love
In all the wrong places

You better keep on looking now!

And so the evening shade will fall
Where nameless voices call and call
And think of all the friends you made
While you toast with Prozac and lemonade

You can hold me under septic skies
(You can dream to your own places)
Watch the sun set in my eyes
(You can't seem to put)
Could this be the time to die?
(A name to all the faces)
The wind upon your face
(Something real)
Your lips upon my lips
Like urban velvet
(To fill those little empty spaces)

So you're looking for love in all the wrong places
You keep on looking for love in all the wrong places

Dream and take away the tears
(Keep on looking now)
Drift on to where your heart is numb
(You gotta keep on looking now)
It's lovely there where love becomes
A drug to fill your need
Just believe in you!
And learn to love yourself
Before anyone else"
96,The Handsome Family,Emily Shore 1819-1839,TRKATUE12903CB9259,1996,"She'd been coughing up blood
Since the dogwoods bloomed
Seventeen that spring
And confined to her room

At night her heart
Pounded holes in her chest
Death, like a bird
Was building its nest

She'd laughed at the graveyard
On one sip of wine
And kept a pet duck
Till the cat crushed its spine

But, waltzing one night
In a red velvet dress
She noticed a whistling down
In her chest

Propped up on pillows
She watched the snow fall
Trying to picture
An end to it all

By spring there'd be picnics
And merry-go-rounds
But she'd be nothing
But bones in the ground

And so
On the last day of her short life
Emily called for her father's
Penknife

She sawed at her head
Till the floor pooled with hair
And braided a watch chain for father
(Mother)
To wear"

All up in your system, hittin it, and everybody move

Here to make you party, body, so groove over to the Glock

Whip out the lighter, flame on up

Everyone, have a nice time, get along with your people
Don't wanna hear people fuss or cuss
If they do, then I crush 'em
Break every bone off in his body
'Cause all my people came here to have a wonderfultime, niggas
Everybody crashed the party
Once in awhile we can get a little wild
And ever now and then, I comin' out to show you how
In the Land, my city, the way we put it down
You know what it is, how to get to my town

Feel them coppers come knockin' on your door
Get you ass on the floor

Check out the Flesh, put it down
When your in the C-Town don't f**k those

Checkin' the best style

Get a light, my sud's froze cold
So off to economies, hit up the store
And I'd love to thank for keepin' the drink I see for me
Get me Ides, get surprised, (copper stops .38) and mo' cheese
Get the with the Gs, set a destination, we're facin'
Finally I'm here (I'm here)
Hit me as I go pissy-drunk, breath stunk, puff spliff after spliff
Chinese - eyes sunk shut, near me pass my beeron to the next man
Goin' up to meet a pretty lady to get my boogie on for the next dance
No ?, her intentions was to get money, and let's face it, shame on you, honey
Bitch made it known she wanna f**k me because I'm a Bone
No threat, better yet I'm a pass up the ass and keep my cash
Leavin' women alone, and go stack up my bankroll
Flip paper, dollar, grab the dollar
Make me holler, feel it in me, nothin' but the Bone

Como expresarlo sin sentirlo,
Eso no puedo ser

Es reprimir el corazón
Es caminar sin libertad
Es destruir lo que no está

Now the ground is cold and there's no fire around.
An absence of fire and you're just cold. And I've seen this dog in my sleep.
He chases my father too, when he dreams between the sheets.

But, I tell you my friend I won't forget you.
And the world's not clean, but they get mad when you're dirty.
If you've handled some food, you better wash up.
Like a 3-legged dog you got three feet.

You can't walk fast or fuck, but you still get in heat.
You can't wag your ears or flap your tail,
But I still see you wandering down by the wishing well.

You've stayed out all night and you're just too old."

110,Faithless,Baseball Cap,TRWXPGU128F425A08A,1996,"Uhn, smack, there goes my baseball cap I'm on the floor,
 I think I took a bruse to my jaw,
 Jumped me from behind at least three, maybe four,
 I never see my hat no more.


 Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back.
 Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back.

 14 years old and hard to the core, 
 I'm walking home making plans for war,
 My hands was cut, my uncle says 'what's up?'
 Let me guess, your clothes are in a mess, you're in distress, 
 Sit down, take five and let me look at your knees, 
 Your still alive son, please take it easy
 Sometimes you have to let the world know you ain't bluffing,
 But enough is enough, don't loose your life over nothing,
 Scuffling in the street is no way to die,
 And I don't want to have to meet your mama's eye,
 So try and listen hard before you fall into the trap
 Of making war over a baseball cap.

 Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back.
 Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back.


 I sat back, had a think
 My uncle poured a drink
 I had a little cry, my eye started to blink
 'cause what occured from his word to me
 sounds absurd, but I 
 Heard the love in his voice for me
 I made a choice, It was like Snap,
 What's a cap when I got something real like that
 I can measure it, treasure it, and at my leisure 
 sit down with those who mean the most to me
 The baseball cap was a ghost, this is real to me
 ""You got steel, son"" My uncle's talkin'
 ""Takes a champion to walk and keep walking""
 ""Drink your drink, and let the words sink in,
 Say goodnight to your mom and think again""
 So I took my 14 years up to bed
 Everything he said taking root in my head
 I shed all my tears, and let my 14 years
 Relax..

 Oh, smash (..smack). There goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back.
 Oh, smash (..smack), there goes my baseball cap,
 It's gone, gone, gone, gone,
 I can't get it back."

A lonely boy in a lonely room
Raindrops hit on window glass
Looking out as people pass

I remember the past and how much it can hurt
Soaking in the depression for all that it's worth
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room

Hears a song and breathes a sigh
Sits and eats the humble pie
Wallows in the circumstance
Companionship is a mirror glance

I remember the past and how it hasn't changed
Always searching for answers, the questions remain
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room
In my room, In my room

Sittin' in darkness
I hear a whisper
I feel a presence
I hear a voice

Livin' in the darkness
I have a shadow
I feel a spirit
I feel the ghost...
Never lettin' me go
Never lettin' me go
Never lettin' me go

I remember the past and how much it can hurt
Soaking in the depression for all that it's worth
Never wanting to leave, never wanting to stay...

In a lonely room
Where the walls were a way to escape from the world
In a lonely room
I remember the pain that I felt from inside...of my room"

I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.
I have decided,
Being good is just a fable,
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.
There's a wealth of things that I profess,
I said that I believed,
But deep inside I never changed;
I guess I'd been deceived.
'Cause a voice inside kept telling me,
That I'd change by and by,
But the Spirit made it clear to me,
That kind of life's a lie.
I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deciver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.
I have decided,
Being good is just a fable,
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.
So forget the game of being good,
And your self-righteous pain.
'Cause the only good inside your heart
Is the good that Jesus brings.
And when the world begins to see you change,
Don't expect them to applaud.
Just keep your eyes on Him and tell yourself,
I've become the work of God.
I have decided,
I'm gonna live like a believer,
Turn my back on the deceiver,
I'm gonna live what I believe.
I have decided,
Being good is just a fable,
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.

Fumbling through these closets
It's got to be here somewhere
I know it's round here somewhere

Searching from room to room
We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere
It's got to be here somewhere

Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown

Chorus:
We didn't give it away
We just left it alone
We tried to find it one day
That's when we noticed it gone
I turned the house upside down
Praying I'd stumble across
Some sign that it's still around
Got to find the love that we lost

Captured in old picture frames
Shinning in those faces
It used to be here somewhere
I know it's still here somewhere
Reflected in our children's eyes
How could we misplace it
I know it was here yesterday
How could it just slip away
it was more then just a box of junk
We stored away to gather dust
This was a dream we thought
We always could reach out and touch

(Repeat Chorus twice)

Got to find the love that we lost"

It's even raining in my heart
I'll close my eyes and let it pour
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls
And in the darkness of the night
A trace was left by your perfume
The only thing you couldn't take
Are the golden memories of you
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls
Across an ocean wide a voice that calls your name
A love that never dies like an eternal flame
Across the great divide for all eternity
Across all space and time the heart that beats is mine
Since you've been gone it's been raining hard
But now the sun shines high above
And I won't miss you anymore
Cos I've found another love
Now see how the rain falls
Now see how the rain falls"

Just take a look at the whites of my eyes
See me now and I will apologise
For me for you we knew they were lies

It makes me angry ashamed but really alive
It may have worked but at what price
What's the point in always looking back
When all you see is more and more junk

It was no surface but all feeling
Maybe at the time it felt like dreaming

Maybe richer maybe wiser
Seems so easy to not go too far
Beg me to stop hate my face I know
Tell me forever justto go

Just one thing before I get to sleep
Nothing here but the stains on my teeth
No not blood just liquid from you
I only wish it was the truth

Feel the guilt of a sinner feel the cold of a winter

Maybe at the time it felt like dreaming"
