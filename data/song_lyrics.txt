drake:one dance
Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away

Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where

Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where

'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

kungs vs cookin' on 3 burners:this girl
Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change 'cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love!

No other thing that's as precious to
(No other, there's no other!)
Than a heart that feels and a heart that's true
Somethin' that you've got to know this girl

(Woh!)
Take my hand
To win over
Take my hand (You)
To-to win over
Take my hand (You)
To win over
Take my hand
To win over

These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love!

You'll buy me this and you'll buy me that
To win over, win me over!
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Somethin' that you've got to know this

Will you realize when I'm gone
That I'll dance to a different song?
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I'll dance to a different song?
It's a shame but I've got to go

(Woh!)
Take my hand
To win over
Take my hand (You)
To-to win over
Take my hand (You)
To win over
Take my hand
To win over

justin timberlake:can't stop the feeling
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling, yeah
So keep dancing, come on

Oh yeah
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body

Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on

calvin harris:this is what you came for
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

Lightning, this is what you came for

You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

We go fast 'til they can't replay
Who knows why it's gotta be this way
We say nothing more than we need
I say "your place" when we leave

Lightning, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh

drake:too good
Drake:
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Drake:
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Drake:
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Rihanna:
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

Rihanna:
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as the expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Drake:
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

Drake &amp; Rihanna:
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Popcaan:
Gyal a you mi waan

clean bandit:tears
I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees

You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn out that light now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

I, I, I'll get over you
I, I, I'll get over you
I, I, I'll get over you
I, I, I'll get over you

When did you lose your emotion?
When did you become so cruel?
And if you want to cut me open
Says a thousands words 'bout you
And in time I know you'll leave me
Like a distant memory
I know love can be so easy
If I stop, I'll loving me

You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn out that light now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
I'll get over you
Yeah, ooh
I'll get over you, woah

Tears on the ground, rain in my window
The pain washes out
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I, I, I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I don't need you to call me tonight
(I'll get over you)
I don't need you to see me if I'm alright
(I'll get over you)
You left me, so leave me, I'm fine
I'll be here getting on with my life

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
I'll get over you
(Rain at my window, the pain washes out)
And I'll get over you
Tears on the ground, rain at my window
The pain washes out
And I'll get over you
Oh yeah,
I'll get over
I'll get over you

gnash:i hate u i love u
Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If u wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

mike posner:i took a pill in ibiza
I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said "tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient"
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs

Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously

dj snake:middle
Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee is going cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

Lying down beside you, what's going through your head
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill
We cannot sweep it under the carpet

I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worry
Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer

So, what would you little maniacs like to do first?

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Shut my eyes and count to ten
It goes in one ear out the other
One ear out the other
Burning bright right till the end
Now you'll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs

Watching through my fingers...
Watching through my fingers...

In my thoughts you're far away
and you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day,
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

What's gonna be left of the world
if you're not in it
What's gonna be left of the world oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more!
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more!

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Caught off guard by your favorite song
I'll be dancing at a funeral,
dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It's such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn

What's gonna be left of the world
if you're not in it
What's gonna be left of the world oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

You might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool, put me in my place,
put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor, put me in my place,
put me in my place

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Watching through my fingers, watching through my fingers
'Cause every minute and every hour

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more...

Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move

Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right

Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us

Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea

Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea

pink:just like fire
I know that I'm runnin' out of time
I want it all, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it all, mmm

And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
Imma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you 'cause they are all the same, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game, mmm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing, no

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
Imma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like fire, fire
(Run it, run it, run it)
(We came here to run it, run it, run it)

So look I came here to run it
Just 'cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it

Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come-a, come uh with me

Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?

Mmm, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like fire, burnin' up the way

coldplay:hymn for the weekend
Oh angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low

I oh I oh I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high

Oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low

I oh I oh I
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high

I oh I oh I
La la la la la la la
So high so high

Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high

lukas graham:7 years
Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old

twenty one pilots:heathens
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, how'd I get here sitting next to you?
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

You'll never know the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How'd I get here, sitting next to you"
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it)
(Watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
(Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
(Watch it)

Why'd you come, you knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us

I know I could lie but I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go there's a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I'm close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I'm close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

I know I could lie but I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go there's a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

Some people pray to their God for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

I know I could lie but I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go there's a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

I've been drowning in the river
Tried to soothe my soul
Take me under, take me deeper
Than I choose to go
I can't see it any clearer
I said long ago
But down here underneath the surface
You're my only hope

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

I've been waiting for the storm
To surrender my soul
Bathe me in your holy water and lay me down

If you remember me everyone else can forget
Everyone else can forget
Tell them I have nothing, nothing

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time
And oh I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me
Cry, cry, cry
I know, I know, I know you hear me

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender
Cause I surrender

Cause I'd rather go blind
Than watch you walk out of my life
Turn my face up to the sky
You know we all, we all, we all, we all cry
Heart on the line for the love we left behind
I can't let you go this time

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

mk & becky hill:piece of me
When I look back to before
We were together
There was no pressure
No pain, just pleasure
We were young, you took my breath and
Filled your lungs up
I held my tongue in
Swept up all your poison

You get high, act like
I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice
You don't realise

I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you
It ain't how it used to be
You lost out, and now I've found
That I don't need that piece of me I've lost

(You can keep that piece of me, yeah)

Falling into emptiness
I've forgotten my mind
Faithless tears that I cried
I lost my whole life
Everything to live for now
I've shed my old skin
I thought I'd give in
But loving isn't losing

You get high, act like
I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice
You don't realise

I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you

Come on, come on, come on now

No one but you got me feeling this way
There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe intellect will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now
Come on, come on, come on now
Maybe we don't need no reason
Why
Come on, come on, come on now

rihanna:needed me
Mustard on the beat ho

I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

twenty one pilots:stressed out
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money

Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah

shawn mendes:stitches
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread,
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread,
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)

Tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please")
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Nick Jonas:
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn

With just one breath, I'm locked in
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
On that, it's almost shocking
I know, I know you know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

'Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too...

Close, ooh

Tove Lo:
Oh man, oh man
I am not really known for ever being speechless
But now, but now somehow
My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, oh
I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
Saying all the things I'm thinking
Oh man, oh man
I am like you so I want proof of what you're feeling

'Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
'Cause space is just a word made up by someone who's afraid to get too...

Both:
Close, ooh
Oh, so close, ooh

craig david:one more time
One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

I got liquor in my system
Feeling kinda wavy, got me thinkin'
Of all the things we used to do
Back then when I was still with you
You were there for me from the start
When I didn't ever pain and steal with your heart
For me those feelings haven't changed
Need you back in my arms again

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing

One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right
Just let me love you one more time

One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

I wanna hold you, but it's from a distance
I don't know what to do, needed some assistance
I roll up to your mum's house, I don't even business
Cause I do anything, cause maybe she can help me fix this
So many mandem on your case, really shoudn't allowed it
I was nobody and you picked me out of the crowed
It took me this long just for me to figure it out
But the simple fact is I'm lost girl when you ain't around

Southampton I was raised in the days
Remember when you used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers getting a quick fade and a shave
What can I say?
Didn't think these days that I'd be missing
Now I'm sitting at this table waiting and reminiscing

One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time
One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

So tell me baby is there hope for you and me?
Cause I just wanna have you back in my arms
Kicking myself, it drives me crazy thinking 'bout you
Counting all the nights and days you've been gone

One, two, three, four five
Doesn't matter how many time I try
Can't be without your love
So I'm not giving up no, no
Five, four, three, two, one
Doesn't matter what's been said or done
Yeah I can make it right

One more time, one more time, one more time
Just let me love you one more time

blonde & craig david:nothing like this
I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
No I ain't felt nothing quite like this

Getting wavy, liquor in my system
Sending out Snapchats, sitting in my kitchen
Looking at this chick looking at a next ting
But there's only one thing that I'm really missing
It's you, cause you're the only one I'm thinking about
Things really ain't the same knowing you ain't around
When I was down you were there for me, didn't give a damn
But now the money means sheet without me holding you down
So that's another raise in the days
My thing used to pick me up from raves in the days
When I was selling mixtapes instead of getting grades
In my barbers' getting a quick fade and a shape
What can I say

I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
I ain't felt nothing like this, like this
No I ain't felt nothing quite like this

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
'Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold

And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on, if time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

And I don't like talking to strangers

I'm tryna be cool but I may just go ape shit
Say "fuck y'all" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazing
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it Cudi
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it tell me now, isn't it funny? Nah

Cause I'm wonderin' my whole life

kygo:raging
Standing in the cold in the frozen wind
I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end
No, no, no
Walking on a plane as I hold my breath
It's gonna be weeks till I breathe again
No, no, no

I know that you hate it, and I hate it
Just as much as you
But if you can brave it
I can brave it, brave it all for you

Call me anytime you can see the lightning
Don't you be alone, you can always find me
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our heart keep trading places
We've got our wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

Checking into hotel loneliness
It's not what I've been used to, I confess
So I wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger is nothing new
She knows how to smile, but not like you
So I wait for you all night

I know that you hate it, and I hate it
Just as much as you
But if you can brave it
I can brave it, brave it all for you

Call me anytime you can see the lightning
Don't you be alone, you can always find me
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got our wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging

Call me anytime you can see the lightning
Don't you be alone, you can always find me
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Holding on the wind with you forever
Holding onto us for worse or better
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Never feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging

beyonce:hold up
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Ohh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Ohh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Ohh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
The way I did before
(We don't talk anymore)
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game (Oh)
Now I can't get you out of my brain (Woah)
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

twenty one pilots:ride
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you, that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do

I'd live for you, and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming
Like who would you live for, who would you die for
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride, oh oh, yeah

Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my

I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much, help me
I've been thinking too much, I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much, help me

tom odell:magnetised
See those birds go across the sky
Few thousand miles they fly
How do they know which way to go
Somehow they always seem to know

They say mother nature is never what we see
I wish I had a little more of nature in me
Wish I had a little mother nature in me

'Cause it's not bright, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed, just never gonna need me
Sure the world keeps the moon in the sky
She keeps me hanging on
She keeps mee hanging on

See the couple lying on the bus
Falling asleep with so much trust
I wish I had a change to let them know
That love is like a flower in the snow

If it's just fair amongst that may be
I wish I had a little fair amongst for me
I wish I had a little fair amongst for me

'Cause it's not bright
I am magnetised to somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed
I know you never gonna need me
Sure the world keeps the moon in the sky
She keeps me hanging on
She keeps mee hanging on
She keeps me hanging on
Love decides, water's black
When you love someone that don't love you back

It's not bright, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed, just never gonna need me
Sure if the world keeps the moon in the sky
She keeps me hanging on
She keeps me hanging on
She keeps me hanging on
She keeps me hanging on

You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark

Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design

Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stick to the ting, now I am your king, my girl this is what we say

And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
(I just wanna, I just wanna)
And show you the way I feel
You make my love go...

You make my love go...

years & years:desire
I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising

Open your arms and pray
To the truth that you're denying
Give in to the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
Cause your love only gets me abused

Give me that rush
I want to show you what you've been missing
Am I enough
To keep your other lovers hidden

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me
You need it now
You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you
I want desire
Cause your love only gets me abused

Is it desire?
Or is it love that I'm feeling for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

selena gomez:hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

'Cause all of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

My doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the doubts and the outbursts
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself

one direction:history
You gotta help me, I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feeling you wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holding on, aren't we?

No, they don't teach you this in school
Now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on, aren't we?

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on, aren't we?

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I've realized
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know!

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

You and me, got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me, got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

So don't let me go, so don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know, baby don't you know
We can live forever

chase & status/george the poet:spoken word
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good

I believe in the meaning of spoken word
The feeling of freedom and healing the bleeding
In need of a reason, I wrote this verse
Yo, I hope this works
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
But best believe it's your claim on it
Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
(Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)

You're gonna go through things you don't deserve
And it's gonna hurt like an open nerve
So just know your soul's as old as Earth
And whatever you do, don't be told its worth
Being strong feels exactly the same as being weak
The difference is you don't quit
Not until you reach the peak
I believe in the mean of the spoken word
It's more than a speech to speak
It's what I feel when I'm sitting in your presence
The answers are written in your essence
It's all a test to see if you're made for it
So go for it, you can't wait for it
Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it

Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free to feel good
Everybody's free
(Cause you've got a destiny with your name on it)

Everybody's free to feel good
(It's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)
Everybody's free to feel good
(It's your fight, your glory, your right, your story)

The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war and anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness

Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down

I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

I am holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
One, two, three; one, two, three; drink
Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier

I am holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight

Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight, on for tonight

ed sheeran:photograph
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home

snakehips:all my friends
We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bit of brown salt, stinging on my tongue and I
I will not waver, I will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn, burn your love into the ground
With the lips of another
'Til you get lonely, sure I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

I hate the bar
Pharmacy addict hit a Wall Street traffic took the car
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it, skrrr
Crash on the floor, catch the ZZZ's
Popping the polar opposite the NZT
Hip hop and the propaganda say they name brand
But I done seen how the xan did my main man
The nights we won't remember
Are the nights we won't remember
I'll be gone 'till November
On my city come December
Dreams are made for cages nigga
Lions are for real nigga
Dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills nigga
Friday's awful chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest in peace the recipe
The rest of us are praying that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

Don't even know me
Sure I get lonely some nights
When the angels on my shoulder
Slump my head
I'm stuck here with the vultures
Hissing and circling
You didn't call me, call me, call me, call me
I'm crawling, crawling, crawling back to you

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man I drink too much
Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
They like Pablo, "why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I...
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki

adele:hello
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

major lazer:lean on
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on

Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on

alessia cara:wild things
To me, ‘where the wild things are' is a place that exists in our minds. It's a place of liberty and shamelessness. It can take a split second of our lifetime to find it, but once you do you'll be free.

Find table spaces 
Say your social graces 
Bow your head, they're pious here 
But you and I, we're pioneers 
We make our own rules 
Our own room, no bias here 
Let 'em sell what they are sellin' 
There are no buyers here 
So gather all the rebels now 
We'll rebel rouse and sing aloud 
We don't care what they say no way, no way 
And we will leave the empty chairs 
To those who say we can't sit there 
We're fine all by ourselves 

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being... 

Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be alright 
Don't mind us 
Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be just fine 
Don't mind us, yeah 
Find me where the wild things are 

I lose my balance on these eggshells 
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead 
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd 
The cool kids aren't cool to me 
They're not cooler than we are 

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being... 

Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be alright 
Don't mind us, yeah 
Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be just fine 
Aye-aye-aye don't mind us 

We will carve our place into time and space 
We will find our way, or we'll make a way, say hey, hey, hey 
Find you're great, don't you hide your face 
And let it shine, shine, shine, shine 

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance 
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s 
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies 
We have no apologies for being... 

Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be alright 
Don't mind us, yeah 
Find me where the wild things are 
Oh my, we'll be just fine 
Don't mind us, yeah 
Find me where the wild things are 

There's a wild thing that exists in all of us, it lives in our passions and the people we love, in our subconscious thoughts, our beliefs... It's even made a home in the darkest parts of us but we can't be scared of it... We have to become it.

drake:hotline bling
You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phones
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

james bay:let it go
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

Come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

little mix:secret love song
When you hold me in the street 
And you kiss me on the dance floor 
I wish that it could be like that 
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough

It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

When you're with him, do you call his name,
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless

Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby
I don't wanna hide us away
Tell the world about the love we're making
I'm living for that day, someday

Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours!

Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't I say that I'm in love?
I wanna shout it from the rooftops
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours

Why can't we be like that?
Wish we could be like that

drake:with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you

Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choose your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story of just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you

meghan trainor:me too
Who's that sexy thang I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thang hangin' 'round my neck?
That's gold, show me some respect

I thank God every day
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

Turn the bass up
Turn the bass up
Turn the bass up
Let's go

I thank God every day
That I woke up feelin' this way
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

kygo:stay
Thought I could leave you 'cause I felt my heart numbing
It hit so deep, I closed my eyes and I just took off running
I turned around and saw the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed
But I don’t need you and you should know that, baby
It'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
Then I felt sorry for the look on your face
So I stayed, stayed

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You wanna leave her, don’t wanna hurt nobody
I don’t believe a single word you say, or that you’re sorry
Why can’t I say no to the look on your face
I just stay, stay

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay, yeah
You push me away, push me away
But I always stay, I always stay
But will you, but will you, but will you

So I stayed, stayed
So I stayed, stayed

I stay, I stay
Oh why do I stay?
So I stayed, stayed

mumford & sons/baaba maal:there will be time
But in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

In the cold light I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

Baaba Maal:
So I opened up my eyes
To a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night

But I lift up my eyes
To a new height
And indeed there will be time

But in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

In the cold light I live, I'll only live for you
It's all that I am

It's all that I have

And in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

In the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have

Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

Baaba Maal:
And in the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have
In the cold light I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am
It's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?
