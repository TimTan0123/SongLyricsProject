quit not until you reach the peak i believe in the mean of the spoken word it's more than a speech to speak it's what i feel when i'm sitting in your presence the answers are written in your essence it's all a test to see if you're made for it but best believe it's your claim on it cause you've got a destiny with your name on it everybody's free to feel good everybody's free to feel good everybody's free to feel good everybody's free (cause you've got a destiny with your name on it) you're gonna go through things you don't deserve and it's gonna hurt like an open nerve so just know your soul's as old as earth and whatever you do don't be told its worth being strong feels exactly the same as being weak the difference is you don't quit not until you reach the peak i believe in the mean of the spoken word it's more than a speech to speak it's what i feel when i'm sitting in your presence the answers are written in your essence it's all a test to see if you're made for it so go
