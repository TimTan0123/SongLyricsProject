Unter Null:Godless
So many days I can't stop myself
From fighting this monster that eats me alive
So many times I've fought and I've tried
To live for a moment without fearing my mind
I hate this, yet live this, and it's bringing me down
I feel like I'm standing on uneven ground
The balance to life has been skewered so violent
I'm so sick of this death-instinct silence

So despondent and so somber, so frail
So scared to begin for the fear I will fail
I'm alone in this pattern and I can't call for grace
I'm left in this mess that is such a disgrace
I fear for my mind more than I fear for life
The one thing worth saving is the love I deny
For I feel so hollow, and I yearn to relent
The control for some peace and freedom from this torment

There's no one to save me and I can't save myself
I would give my whole being for some kind of help
But no one can stop this god damn monster so great
All hope is now lost and it's too late
I numb to forget, to quiet the noise
I'm deafened by silence, I can't live with myself
I numb to forgive, for myself can't forget
That I could've been someone without any regret

You lying man who tells a tale
Of flawless love and peace of mind,
Of parting seas and curing blind
Your lies my faith, there's no remorse
You spin your tale with brutal force
Your lies, my faith, my breathing grace
I ran from life, I erased my faith
I am so blind
And seeing eyes are not the kind

Unter Null:Moving On
I'm so afraid to have you feel like this
But you're so afraid of second chances
Despite the walls growing in between us
I'm moving on...

I'm so afraid of feeling like this
You're so afraid of going past us
You just betrayed the one to never turn their back
I'm moving on...

You built this up the best you could
But there are things misunderstood
Like how to love, and how to care
And always trying to be there
When life was hard and I fell down
You left me crawling on the ground
You let me suffer and you didn't care
And all I needed was you there
It's time for me to be moving on
To start the life that's not begun
I'm moving on...

This is the last time you will betray me
This is the last time that you will hurt me
This is the last time you've destroyed my hope
I'm moving on...

I'll be okay after you have gone
Without you my life will still go on
But neither hope nor bliss
Will undo all the shit you've done
I'm moving on...
This is the last time that I'll stay
And then again I'm moving on
I'm moving on...

You built this up the best you could
But there are things misunderstood
Like how to love, and how to care
And always trying to be there
When life was hard and I fell down
You left me crawling on the ground
You let me suffer and you didn't care
And all I needed was you there
It's time for me to be moving on
To start the life that's not begun

I'm moving on...

Unter Null:I Can't Be The One (EX.ES Mix)
In the silence
In this poisonous room
With no space to breathe
As you hover and loom

Guilt held over my head
It's to heavy to take
I feel myself breaking 
under the weight of mistakes

You constantly say
I have room to improve
? doesn't reach higher
You never improve

This life of these games
They become so apparent
And I break through the void
and leave you in torment
(Torment) 

(Chorus)
I will be the one who remains unbroken
I will be the one who speaks words unspoken
I will be the one who doesn't accuse
I will be the one who doesn't abuse
I won't be the one who constantly blames
I won't be the one who plays fucking games
I won't be the one you control anymore 
I want you to know as I walk out the door

I can't ???
and you shouldn't have mine
you're dependent and sick
Though you deny, deny

Disappointing your curse
So shut off from life
You're too proud to admit
So you lie, you lie

I can't save your solace
cause you're lacking a heart
I can't say you're broken
Though your falling apart

I can't guide you away
from the path you must take
We will only find ruin
pain and heartache

(Chorus) X2

Usher:Mars vs. Venus
Initiate radar

Your eyes say it all, all
They're fixed upon an object of desire
You can't control, no
But gravity compels you to ignite and explode, oh

'Til our time and space combine
You'll fantasize the unknown, oh

Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seen your stars, baby?

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, yeah, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?
Mars vs Venus

Seduce and analyze, yeah
Objective is to conquer deep inside
Make paradise

Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seen your stars? Oh

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?
Mars vs Venus

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?
Mars vs Venus

Oh, pitch black, glossed amidst the galaxy between the sheets
Warmth that only you and I generate when we collide
Hold that, don't make my emotions peak
If I let go then I'll be weak, your control is my defeat

I repeat never, never, never
Never will I give up, no, no, no, no
I ain't giving up now

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?
Mars vs Venus

This is big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love and drama, who's in control?
Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide

This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire
Sex, love and drama, who can take desire?
Mars vs Venus

When the worlds collide I don't know if I will win
But I know I wanna do it again, Mars vs Venus
When the worlds collide, I don't know if I will win
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah

I don't know if I'll ever win, Mars vs Venus

Yeah, you know who you are

Usher:Okay

Car's waiting outside, baby, if you ready to roll

Girl we been at it so long I can't wait just want to make sure we're on the same page

I suggest we take this here home so we can make a love song

Usher:Making Love (Into The Night)
Just tell me where to go
And I'll take off my clothes for you, yeah
You know we had to do it again, right?
You're in total control and you're running the show
I'll do whatever you tell me, baby

Baby, I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever into the night
Forever and ever, we'll make love into the night

Your wish is my command
So I'll cancel my plans tonight, yeah, oh baby, yeah
I'll make you understand that I'm the only one
Who can handle your body right
And I'ma show you tonight, ooh wait, baby, I'm coming

Baby, I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever into the night
Forever and ever we'll make love into the night

If you ever wanna know who I love

And I would make love to you forever and ever into the night
Forever and ever we'll make love into the night

You gonna wanna tell everybody
'Bout how I got you all, coming when I call
You know I break you off
And if these walls could talk they would tell everybody

'Bout how I put it down, you know I shut you down
Got you up off the ground, yes, I can't be wasted
If I let you on my spaceship, you'll have to let me taste it
Hop on it, I'ma give you a ride
'Cause we gonna make love all through the night

Vampire Weekend:Taxi Cab
Unsentimental
Driving around
Sure of myself
Sure of it now

You stand this close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown

I remember
Remember it well
But if I'd forgotten
Could you tell?

In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat

Compound to compound
Lazy and safe
Wanting to leave it
Wanting to wait

When the taxi door was open wide
I pretended I was horrified
By the uniform clothes outside
Of the court yard gate

You're not a victim
But neither am I
Nostalgic for garbage
Desperate for time

I could blame it on your mother's hair
Or the colors that your father wears
But I know that I was never fair
You were always fine

Unsentimental
Driving around
Sure of myself
Sure of it now

You were standing this close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown

I remember
Remember it well
And if I'd forgotten
Could you tell?

In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You were standing on another track
Like a real aristocrat

Vampire Weekend:Holiday
Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word bombs
She'd never seen the word bombs
Blown-up to 96 point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A t-shirt so lovely it turned
All the history books grey

I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf

So if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
60
Vampire Weekend:Run
Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work

She said, "You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

Worlds away from cars
And all the stars and bars
Where a little bit of competition means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch

I said, "You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

'Cause only with you
It's the only honest way to go
And I could take two
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you
And a little battered radio
We could try

So lead my feet away
'Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised

She said, "You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But with her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run

'Cause only with you
It's the only honest way to go
And I could take two
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you
And a battered radio
We could try
61
Vampire Weekend:I Think Ur A Contra
I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even without hope
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra
I think you're a Contra

My revolution thoughts
Your little lies of desire
I wanna trace 'em to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we both made up our minds
You're gonna watch out for yourself
And so will I

I think you're a Contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a Contra
'Til you've tried

You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a Contra
You wanted rock 'n' roll, complete control
Well, I don't know

Never pick sides, never choose between two
But I just wanted you, I just wanted you
Said, "Never pick sides, never choose between two"
But I just wanted you, I just wanted you

I think you're a Contra
I think that you lie
Don't call me a Contra
'Til you've tried

Vampire Weekend:Giving Up The Gun
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

When I was 17 I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the chance remains to see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down
My ears are blown to bits from all the rifle hits
But still I crave that sound

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

I heard you play guitar down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
Your Tokugawa smile and your garbage style
Used to save the night
You felt the coming wave, told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch
But in the years that passed since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

Vampire Weekend:White Sky
An ancient business, a modern piece of glass work
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole immortal corporation's given its permission

A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions a thousand little Julia's
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Around the corner, the house that modern art built
I ask for modern art to keep it out the closets
The people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor the Richard Serra Skate Park

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
"While are the horses racin' taxis in the winter?"
Look up at the buildings, imagine who might live there
Imagining your Wolford's in a ball upon the sink there

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once
65
Vampire Weekend:California English
Wouldn't ever gag you with a spoon, my only true love
Never really heard you speak that way, it's unworthy of
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country just to sunburn his scalp
Contra Costa, Contra Mundum, contradict what I say
Living at the French Connection, but we'll die in LA

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there 'til May
Leafing through a stack of A-Z's to surf the UK
Waiting with the wind against your face and gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts, you don't seem to care

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

Sweet carob rice cake, she don't care how the sweets taste
Fake Philly cheese steak, but you use real toothpaste
'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse
Would you loose all of you faith in the good earth?
And if it's all a curse and we're just getting worse
Baby, please don't lose your faith in the good earth

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

Vanessa Paradis:Scarabee
Sur le radeau, t'es seul
T'es beau, tu rames au fil de l'eau
À quatre, la vie est plus belle
L'amour, l'amitié, c'est tout pareil

On t'aimait, Scarabée, on t'aimait

Au fil de l'eau
On croit que la vie est éternelle
On meurt parfois
De chanter seul
À quatre, à quatre, les murs font prison
Ça fait rien
Il fait beau

Au fil du temps
T'es seul, t'es grand
Et tu souris aux gens...
Du ciel, la vie est plus belle
L'amour, l'amitié, c'est tout pareil

On t'aimait, Scarabée, on t'aimait

Dans le soleil
Tu sais que la vie est éternelle
Y a plus de combat
On n'est plus seul
Au ciel, on n'est plus seul

Ça fait rien, il fait beau

Tout seul sur la terre
Chante un scarabée assassiné
Tout seul, il chante comme il chantait
Tout seul sur la terre
Chante un scarabée qu'on a tué
Tout seul, il chante comme il chantait

On t'aimait John-Scarabée, on t'aime

Vedera:We Sing
In the night I have traveled
All alone just to see
Where I left all the memories
I had grown to count as me

Through the days though uncertain
I can live secretly
Just for you, just for you
Just for you

And I strain to see
Will it ever be you and me?

Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

It was cold on the last day
I was trying not to see
In a place so familiar
Yet resisting all of me

I am one, I am only
Who I hope that I can be
All for you, all for you
All for you

And I strain to see
Will it ever be you and me?

Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
Singing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

If you could only see how good
I could be in your arms tonight
If you could only see how good
We could be moving on

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

We sing, oh, oh
We sing, oh, oh

Vedera:Forgive You
Use this time to step aside
And look around with your feeble eyes
Use this time to forget me
Use these days to lie awake
And feel the loss of my embrace
But don't use anymore of me

And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to
And when to move along?

Use your hands to feel the man
I gave my plan and off you ran to find
Someone new who was not me
Use your favorite photograph
To play the recent memory back
Are you still as cold as I am?

And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to
And when to move along?

Well, it started off a simple black and blue
Hidden behind the untrue
But now it's surfacing, I need to be released
From the love that was you
From the love that was you

And how do you say?
And how do you say I forgive you?
And how do you know?
And how do you know when to choose to?

'Cause I want to say
And I want to say I forgive you
And I want to know
And I want to know when to choose to
And when to move along
And when to move along
78
Vedera:Greater Than
Here in a box I hide the letters
Written, postmarked with your name
Secrets I wish I could only share
With a heart that feels, feels the same

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears

Here's where the notes were torn and crumbled
Before feelings could reach the page
Try to replace some sober thought
From emotion, fists held up with rage

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're so much greater
Than

Here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears

Though I'm a simple mind, I know
I can see the picture drawn out here
You are the reason I have found
To keep believing in these years

And though the road is long
The trying keeps us holding on this way
And make no mistake, this is love
Love, love, love, this is love, love

And here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're so much greater
Than

Here we fall to pieces
In front of each other but we know
Somehow we're greater
Than our lonely fears
79
Vedera:Back To The Middle
It's on this road that I'm drawn back to you
As the miles remember me as I go
It's in the silence of a night's dream
That I recall the words of devotion we spoke

And I can't remember where our bodies roamed
I can't remember all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

I separated all I thought I knew
In a pile of books collapsed upon my floor
I memorized the words in code and true
But I can't carry them with me no more

And I can't remember where our bodies roamed
I can't remember all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

Don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you
I won't believe it about you, no

Don't tell me you've been swept away
I can't believe it about you
I won't believe it about you

'Cause you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

And you will draw me near
When the sky opens and we appear
You'll bring me once again
Back to the middle
80
Vedera:The Rain
Take a walk with me, love
You say you can't get enough
Well, you won't till you open your door
And you give some more to me

And the silence in your steps
As you tiptoe 'round the rest
Makes me want to pull you in
And kiss you my friend, and your silly games

And I'm not tired
I could chase you around and abate you
Here again and again
So tell me lies if you want to
I can take it, I won't be afraid
'Cause I am the rain

The rain is gentle some days
It can clean off the mess that winter made
The rain can wash all the years of doubt
And the tears that were shed

So, just look up, please
Shine a little bit of hope to me
Let me know there's a season for all
And a season to call you my love

And throw me off with your pride
It's okay, I won't hide
Here again and again
I'll tell you, there's no mistaking
The reason that I'm not afraid
'Cause I am the rain

The rain will wash us clean, and I know
The rain will wash us clean, and when it does
I will be right beside you, holding on, holding on
The rain will wash us clean, and I know
The rain will wash us clean, and when it does
I will be right beside you, holding on, holding on
81
Vedera:Even I
I don't wanna notice
I don't wanna see
Even I don't give up
Even I won't give up

You're breaking the surface
So what's left of me?
Tell me when is enough
Tell me I should give up

It's not the way you move
It's your words
Though they soothe
They're not telling the truth

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

My heart it was open
You stepped through the door
It is tearing me up
Giving in, giving up

Left here always hoping
One day there'd be more
Even I don't give up
But tell me when is enough

I see the strings you pull
I'm not blind
And I'm not fooled
Well, you know it's true

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

And here we are one glance away
I wanted you, you couldn't stay
Every part of me
Still reaching out, reaching in

And will I be here till the day
You've found another
To back away from?
I won't make the same mistake again, no

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

Didn't I know you?
Didn't I try to carry on
While just believing in you?

Didn't I give up everything?
Tell me now if there's
A reason for anything

'Cause even I don't give up
Even I don't give up
Even I don't give up
Even I don't give up

I don't wanna notice
I don't wanna see
Even I don't give up
Even I won't give up
82
Vedera:A World Apart
Well, here we stand alone, our goodbyes and our waiting
Getting our feet to move, always the hardest part
Like friends we know we've traveled off from one another
And we're trying to face the days a world apart

And change is what we have all been born into
That's what he said and all that I have to hold on to

But you have opened up the heart of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
And you have opened up a part of me
Saying, please don't leave me here
When I'm a world apart from you

My independence is the part that drew you in
You said, I like the way you know a thing or two
But I must confess the air I breathe and paths I tread
Are making me less aware of what I am to do

I've done all I can to build the strength I need
Climbed all the mountains, wishing you were here to see

But you have opened up the heart of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
And you have opened up a part of me
Saying, please don't leave me here
When I'm a world apart from

With a true and faithful heart I found
The one apart from all the others
I can stand alone because I know that

You have opened up the heart of me
Taken the shadows and replaced them with your face
And you have opened up a part of me
Saying, please don't leave me here

And you, and you
Saying, please don't leave me here
And you, and you
Saying, please don't leave me here

And you, and you
Please don't leave me here
And you, and you
Saying, please don't leave me here
When I'm a world apart from you
83
Vedera:Loving Ghosts
I don't know how long I've been here
The days all run together
You're gone but you won't disappear
Traces of you will last forever

It feels like if I hold my breath
You'll walk in any second
And tell me it was all a mistake
Can't believe that you left

And it haunts me to hold you this close
But hurts me more to let go
That's why I'm still loving ghosts
I'm still loving ghosts

They say I should get on with my life
But I can't even get up
I'd rather believe in this beautiful lie
Than admit you're really gone forever

It feels like if I hold my breath
You'll walk in any second
And tell me it was all a mistake
Can't believe that you left

And it haunts me to hold you this close
But hurts me more to let go
That's why I'm still loving ghosts

Every sense is screaming
Every hair stands on my skin
Every room I feel it, you are here

Baby, I'm not seeing but I'm still believing
My heartbreak a chance worth taking
So on this floor, I'll still be waiting

It feels like if I hold my breath
You'll walk in any second
And tell me it was all a mistake
Can't believe that you left

And it haunts me to hold you this close
But hurts me more to let go
That's why I'm still loving ghosts

And oh, I feel you this close now
And oh, I'm still loving ghosts now
And oh, I feel you this close now
And oh, I'm still loving ghosts
I'm still loving, still loving ghosts
84
Vedera:Goodbye My Love
What do you see when you close your eyes?
Do you watch all your dreams go by?
I'll tell you what I see
You're an uncut diamond, you're the rarest star
A lonebird dying to fly so far
A beautiful mystery, that's what you are
Such a beautiful mystery

So baby go on and live your life
I can't hold on to your pretty life
Don't let all your dreams just pass you by
This is your time
Even though I know that it's bittersweet
Go and find a pretty love that you need
Even if it takes you away from me
I know it's right, so goodbye my love
Yeah, goodbye my love

Like a violent storm on a quiet day
Your heart is torn between go and stay
I know that you love me
But get on your way
Yeah, I know that you love me but

So baby go on and live your life
I can't hold on to your pretty life
Don't let all your dreams just pass you by
This is your time
Even though I know that it's bittersweet
Go and find a pretty love that you need
Even if it takes you away from me
I know it's right

Don't second guess yourself
No, you know what you need
Don't waste your moment worrying about me
So goodybye my love
Yeah, goodbye my love

Baby go on and live your life
I can't hold on to your pretty life
Don't let all your dreams just pass you by
This is your time
Even though I know that it's bittersweet
Go and find a pretty love that you need
Even if it takes you away from me
I know it's right

You're an uncut diamond, you're the rarest star
A lonebird dying to fly so far
Oh goodbye my love,
Goodbye my love

Vedera:Look Around
I've been running along spaces all alone
Trying to find a place I feel that I belong
You don't seem to notice me
You don't seem to notice me

You've got money and power
To hold your position down
But all this money and power
Is showing me the ground
I can't see anymore
I can't see anymore

Watch you go 

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

I've been thinking that I can find a better way
Outside of all the empty hopes and words you say
You can't breathe when you're alone
You can't breathe when you're alone

Watch you go

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Where'd the people go who told you
All the pretty things, your ego full?
What's the matter now?
I see you falling, falling, falling, falling

Where'd the people go who told you
All the easy words, not what they should?
What's the matter now?
I see you falling, falling, falling, falling

Down, I can see you running
Look around, there is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Down, I can see you running
Look around, look around
There is no one following
Now what're you gonna do solo?
Look around, look around

Vedera:If You Go
You, you should've left me a long time ago
And you, you should've seen how scared I was
But you, you chose to stick around in spite of me
When I let the night take the day

And my friends the tiny glimpses
Of something different, something free
Moved away and moved along the scene
But just remember

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

You, you always take it slowly day by day
And you, you're never turning around
And you, you're always bringing me direction
And I know I'm coming home today

But baby, don't you know me?
I wouldn't give up, oh so soon
You'll see me fighting all those bitter parts
But just remember

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

Take it slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say
Slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say

Slow, we can move away
It doesn't matter what they say
Slow, we can move away
'Cause all that matters

If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all
If you go, well, I'm going with you
If you know, if you know me at all

When I say these words I mean them
And I will be your home again

I get on my bike and I ride and I ride and I'll never be found again
Skin like paper holding a vapor clinging to a dream I had

Clinging to a dream so true, falling for a ghost like you
Clinging to a dream so true, falling for a ghost like you

Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard

I'm broken hearted, dearly departed
Dearly departed, I'm broken hearted

She was my ghost, I know she needed me the most
But we're not alone, we were living in a funeral home
She was my ghost, I know she needed me the most
But we're not alone, we were living in a funeral home

Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard
Found love in a graveyard

I'm broken hearted, dearly departed

She was my ghost
She is my unholy adventure
She was my ghost

Vinnie Paz:Washed in the Blood of the Lamb
If you listen to me then you know my father was G
And the apple don't fall too far from the tree
Me and you is different as we could possibly be
Me and you is just different philosophically
I don't think it's anybody as obnoxious as me
I don't think that anybody else could parted the sea
I don't think that you wanna discuss the horror with me
If I was you I'd move a little bit more farther from me
It ain't nobody living more of a sergeant than me
It ain't nobody alive more of a prophet than me
It ain't nobody living possibly rocking with me
On the stage, in the studio, or boxing with me
Every second I'm awake there is a toxin in me
Anti-depressants, Suboxone, Oxycontin in me
Only a stupid motherfucker have a problem with me
Cause he don't know I got the fucking problem-solver with me

[Chorus]

I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever touches my hand gonna leave enough blood in the sand
I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever fuck with my fam suffering, a motherfucker should scram

I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever touches my hand gonna leave enough blood in the sand
I was washed in the blood of the lamb
Whoever fuck with my fam suffering, a motherfucker should scram

[Verse 2]

I slaughter anything I get my hands on
Inside the Church of Anton with bloody pants on
I was in the land of Israel and heard ram's horn
I was in the sand with Ishmael and fought the sandstorm
I'm just waiting for the raven to thaw
Cause I don't argue with Mesopotamian law
I submit my will and faith into the grace of Allah
And the Mayan calendar say it's erasing us all
The four-fifth you should see this thing, it's berserk
And y'all are royalty inside a fucking kingdom of dirt
How are y'all original when y'all ain't think of it first?
I just wish I could put everything I think into verse
But instead I decide to drink in a Russian bar
I'm Rasputin, I'm influencing a Russian Tsar
I'm Dave Lombardo on drums, leave the percussion scarred
I drink the bottle to the bottom, put my trust in God

[Chorus]
125
Vinnie Paz:Bad Day
Some people wake up late, I wake up mad late
All the time hungover, it's a sad state
I love liquor, she my bitch and her ass great
But I don't remember anything from our last date
I wipe the sleep from my eyes and I peep my phone
Twenty texts, thirty calls, just leave me alone
My head pounding like crazy, I need some Patron
That's the hair of the dog, god need a bone
Kiss my mama on the cheek, she look beautiful
(Vinnie you're a mess, what I'm gonna do with you?)
I know you cooking something
(Yeah, I made some food for you
Managut, bragol, and some brigutte too)
I told you wild times ma I don't fuck with pork
Please pass the lucatelli and a bunch of salt
The phone ring, it's the police but who would've thought?
This motherfucking pig telling me I'm due in court

[Chorus]

Every time I feel this shit is going my way
Something come along and fuck up my day
I had a rhyme in my mind now there's nothing to say
And cousin that just fucked up my day

Driving down the block someone cut in my way
That shit went and fucked up my day
Rap critics, they always got something to say
I would never let that fuck up my day

[Verse 2]

I don't know where the fuck I'm at today
I drank a couple of bottles, I guess I have to pay
This bitch laying next me, she look like Cassius Clay
Gotta get outta here before she asks me to stay
I don't know how I got here in the first place
She had a banging body but she had the worst face
I guess I act like an animal, I deserve hate
She must've lured me in with white like she was third base
It ain't hard to convince me to do some dumb shit
Especially when I'm on that get high and drunk shit
That's why Vinnie always end up with a dumb bitch
The only thing I'm never on is on some punk shit
I'm on the other side of town and I'm walking dolo
Panerai watch, Gucci kicks, lots of Polo
Goons ran up on the kid, put the gat to my dome
I was caught slipping, I left the ratchet at home

Vinnie Paz:Monster's Ball
I feel reinvigorated, don't fuck with the boss
I'd rather cut my own throat before suffering loss
Anybody fucking with me get hung on the cross
I have anger in me, don't make me summon the source
I go to war with the Glock
I go to war with anybody motherfucker, I'm a sorcerer ock
Fucking everything whether the bitch is gorgeous or not
I murder everything, that's just some of my torturous plot
If you righteous and you under attack
Like the Anbar Awakening and Sons of Iraq
The fifty cal is like a thunderous clap
If you think that you safe and nothing wrong that's a presumptuous act
It ain't no tomorrow, I don't got a dime saved
And if you did it's in the Wall Street crime wave
It ain't nothing worse in the world than a mind slave
Going to war with my people how I define brave

[Chorus]

I'm a monster
Ain't no one can fuck with the kid
I'm a monster
My jail brothers stuck with a bid
I'm a monster
Everything I do is precise
I'm a monster
Pazienza ruin your life

I'm a monster
Ain't no one can fuck with the kid
I'm a monster
My jail brothers stuck with a bid
I'm a monster
Everything I do is precise
I'm a monster
Pazienza ruin your life

[Verse 2]

Yeah you know that Vinnie he been nice
Y'all don't belong inside of the ring like you Kimb' Slice
I ain't gonna take all of your skin, just a thin slice
They call me John "The Beast" Mugabi when Vin fights
Vin Laden, Taliban, Hamas, and Al-Qaeda
You a snitch cop lover, you fuck with a traitor
I'm a motherfucking brick you constructed of paper
I dumped the motherfucking clip now you dust and you vapour
I was there when all the planets was born
Before the Continental Drift and when Atlantis was formed
When Gandhi told the Indians to stand and be strong
And took the British out with intellect in spite of their brawn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Everything Pazienza do is hard body
I don't care if you Blood, Ñeta, or Godbody
I was devilish before the power of God got me
I just think I let the fucking sword of Allah chop em
Mossberg nine thirty-five is amazing
The Prada high-tops the same colour as raisin
He a rat, not even his mother can save him
That's what you get for being brothers with Satan
The thirty-eight practical, the Glock is for fair
And this for jail brothers something they can knock on the tier
Yeah, I'll stick a knife in your esophagus queer
I'm an animal, every rhyme will demolish you queers
Gas high but you can get the D for a real price
This Sig Sauer 1911 is real nice
I'll stick through the wrist with a steel spike
And now maybe you'll overstand the pain of the real Christ

[Chorus]
128
Vinnie Paz:Role of Life
Life, this role of life

[Verse 1]

This is Rock of Gibraltar rap
The Springfield M14 show you where the coffin's at
You motherfuckers don't belong in rap
Fuck with me you got a better chance taking an abortion back
You lack flavour, put some sauce on that
I went to the Great Wall, put my fist through and walked through that
Where this motherfucker's fortune at?
I'mma levitate his body, make it spin like a Laundromat
Motherfucker I was born to rap
I've been making records wild long, never did a song that's whack
How many have accomplished that?
I was wild as a young boy, shouldn't have put moms through that
Vinnie Paz been to Nam and back
I ain't never put the guns down cousin so my palms is black
You a bitch, I ain't involved with that
I got a big trunk and that's where Vinnie keep all of his corpses at

[Chorus]

Life, this role of life

[Verse 2]

Silverback Gorilla walk through the minefield
We don't see eye to eye how you define real
Y'all are wondering if I'm out of my mind still
I just need some liquor and pills and I'm chill
I run with Puerto Rocks, Morenos and vagabonds
And Paz will shoot this motherfucker up like Barrie Bonds
I'm like a military doctor, Vinnie carry arms
My shit is military proper, Vinnie carry bombs
I kick in the door like BI did
And the automatic weapons look like TI crib
Vinnie fat, you'll never see my ribs
I don't call it loading bullets, I refer to it as feed my kids
All I think about is slaughtering y'all
This little motherfucker named Charles Hamilton is harder than y'all
It's in the garbage with y'all
Listen to all you Myspace rappers, I'm a father to y'all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

I write in the rain, turn beautiful night into pain
I turn life into a frightening game
I don't have love in me, it's just ice in my veins
My fist Hammer of Thor, I Tyson the game
This rap shit deep in my heart
Y'all was sleep from the start
But that just led to unbelievable art
And on top of that the god is unbelievably smart
My bare fists turn trees into bark
Y'all don't want any improvement at all
Y'all are devils, y'all are torturing the rule of law
My mind is a computer of war
And it's typically the biggest motherfucker that'll usually fall
Give me one take cousin, the god out
A forty of ? and I ride out
The forty Glock popping your eyes out
Now you never get a chance to see what the god 'bout

Vinnie Paz:Same Story (My Dedication) Feat. Liz Fullerton
Intro:

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
And so I have been told

Verse 1:

You came into my mother's life at the right time
More than a step-father, more of like a lifeline
She ain't really had happiness since my pop died
She was living but living is always not alive
And my momma should be treated like a queen
You gave her everything she ever needed like a queen
Probably the most gentle G I ever seen
The love y'all shared I never seen in human beings
Y'all were together twelve years, never no fights
Not even a little argument, that was so nice
Three of us eating dinner together most nights
Working seven days a week, that ain't no life
But never once did I hear you complain
Even when they let you go never hear you with blame
It take a real man to walk through the rain
He was a real man who got sick and fought through the pain

Chorus:

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
And so I have been told

They say we're very far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold

Verse 2:

I walked in that morning and knew something was wrong
I tried to talk to you Rock, you didn't respond
I called 9-1-1 and then ran for my moms
Waiting for the ambulance and I tried to be calm
Moms went with you, I stayed and held down the fort
I was nervous, I was crying and really distraught
I was alone by myself, just left with my thoughts
Mommy called, told me that you had a stroke and fought
I ain't seen a hospital since my father died
I don't like it there, memories is locked inside
When I walked inside the room we started to cry
I was just so happy that you was alive
And you told you how much that you hate the hospital
And that they thieves are trying to keep their pockets full
I think I hold myself a little bit responsible
When you was smoking all the time I wasn't stopping you
Nevertheless you came home and that was real
A lot of therapy and doctors gave you lots of pills
You couldn't drive anymore, you had to stop and chill
And that's too much for anybody that can stop your will
But you never got back to your norm
You was proud, didn't want any help from my mom
I left for tour and you asked me how long I'd be gone
And I could see inside your eyes you knew something was wrong
I got back mommy told me you was sick again
Couldn't believe that we was going through this shit again
I love you Rock and I'm always gonna miss you friend
And for me it's just the same story, different pen

Chorus:

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
And so I have been told

They say we're very far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold [2x]

[Chorus x 2]
I’m taking my own life, I might as well
Guess where I’m going cause the Devil’s inside
I’m taking my own life, that’s where I’m going
Except  they might not sell weed in Hell

[Verse 1]
See I always have respect cause I always talk fact
The .38 and the 50 caliber hot, black
I always left with nothing but I always brought back
I always been a hustler, I probably go off that
Y’all don’t wanna go to work with the boy
There’s only two words that describe me: search and destroy
I don’t think you wanna get murked by the boy
My shit is military, y’alls is like a nursery toy
It’s hurting you boys
My team ain’t even hungry, we famished
I murder everybody, fuck collateral damage
I’m animal savage with Hannibal’s habits
I’ll mangle your cabbage
I walked into the parish and I strangled the faggots
I hang with the baddest brothers, put their trust into Jesus
Run with brothers who’s forty guzzlers, Islamic extremists
Ugly and ignorant is how they perceive us
I don’t care, I’m trying to deal with my personal demons

[Chorus x 2]

[Verse 2]
Y’all don’t wanna go that route
Broke motherfucker need to throw his throwback out
If you see me drinking something good I stole that stout
If you see me drinking in the hood then roll back out
On the real I don’t want no one to bother me, cousin
Rapping just a little fucking bit of part of me, cousin
I’m just trying to have a drink at the bar with my cousin
I ain’t mean to be rude, god, pardon me cousin
I stay strapped lord, gun in the tuck
Young boys act wild lord funny as fuck
I scrap southpaw sonning you fucks
Look at you lord on the floor bummy as fuck, what?
My life been defined by death
So I guess if everybody dead mine is next
My father dropped a jewel on me, time forgets
It’s not as easily the mind forgets
Y’all know what I mean?

[Chorus x 2]

[Verse 3]
Drag you to Hell, I’m evil dead, you can call me Sam Raimi
These motherfuckers want a verse but they can’t pay me
Fuck a funeral home, put em in the sand maybe
Y’all are acting like you’re big, like you’re mad gravy
Y’all don’t wanna beef with the god
Don’t have the brain power to compete with the god
Y’all should retreat from the god before you get turned to meat
Something to eat for the god, peace to the gods
I carry heavy shit, big guns, John Rambo
I’mma spot Russia like Pakistani commandos
How you go to war when you’re standing in sandals?
Now you’re dead and your family handling candles
Don’t even call for a truce, I’m about to end this
Whole motherfucker when I call for the troops
Reservoir dog walk with the troops
And I burn this motherfucker down to the ground down to its roots

Vinnie Paz:Intro
[Clip from some documentary about Vinny Pazienza the boxer I guess]

He's a fighter and fighter… You don't make fighters. Vinnie's a born fighter and I could see that when he was a kid, he was little, he was different from other kids.

[Excerpt from the Hagakure]

Yeah, Pazienza, I'm here baby. The Way of the Assassin is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Assassin.
141
Vinnie Paz:Beautiful Love
I'm out for whatever you wanna call it, cash or paper
My only purpose to kill, perfect assassinator
I'm on the path of Islam, you on the path of Vader
My nickname Buck 50 cousin pass the razor
The 750i turn you from a fan to hater
Feeling myself like I'm a chronic masturbator
I ain't the type of motherfucker you should ask a favour
I'm the type of motherfucker that'll blast my neighbour
I look at anybody as weak that has a saviour
The Israeli Galil will turn your ass to vapour
I got an Ingram MAC-11 and it has a laser
I got a thing for MAC-11s, not a passive nature
Everything I write is war on the pad and paper
I don't listen to rap no more, my passion's Slayer
My heart is cold as the temperature of a massive glacier
I put a giant hole inside you like a massive crater

[Verse 2]

Everywhere I go to ball Paz is strapped
I be loading it up, I be cocking it back
I ain't in my right mind, I ain't stopping at that
I will hit his lifeline in the back of his cap
See I'm faster than a motherfucker grabbing his gat
Beating me is just illogical imagining that
I'm a G you is just a pacifist rat
I make bodies disappear like a magical act
Yeah, I'm just giving the fans another anthem
This is just another example of my expansion
I make your top drop like the new Phantom
I like to pop shots with my new cannon
The left hook wild vicious, I'm a champion
You ain't wilding out cousin, that's a tantrum
Wild assault rifles, thirty fucking handguns
I'm holding all of you motherfuckers for ransom
142
Vinnie Paz:Righteous Kill
I'm a fucking thunderstorm, you's a light shower
You a bitch, you shoot and miss like Dwight Howard
You can't battle the god, I'm too precise coward
That's like Khalid Muhammad saying he's White Power
This the machete that your organs getting sliced out with
The blind motherfucker in the village Bryce Howard
My brain only function proper in the night hours
You might own a fucking label but the mic ours
My shit hi-tech lord like a plastic bomb
An asshole, I punch people with glasses on
Anybody disagreeable we mashing on
I only fuck with green and gold god magic wand
An encore is the only thing that you clapping on
I'm a pitbull pussy, you a papillon
A bitch get a 40 from me, not a glass of Dom
I'm the G-29 in the assassin's palm

[Chorus]

All I hear is danger, all I see is danger
All you hear is "run, run, here come danger"
Shatter dreams like Freddy your thoughts rearrange ya
Stare death dead in the eyes, it'll change ya

All I hear is danger, all I see is danger
All you hear is "run, run, here come danger"
Shatter dreams like Freddy your thoughts rearrange ya
Stare death dead in the eyes, it'll change ya

[Verse 2]

It's a righteous kill, I don't do nothing but write and kill
Drink 40s, smoke el, push the white and krill
I move strong and fast, I have a bison's will
I'm the motherfucking champ, I'm the fightin' Phils
I'm from the city of the syrup and Vicodin pills
From the city the most fearless of fighters was filmed
The city where we have the most street veterans still
The Moors, Nuwaubians, Five Percenters will build
I'm from Philly motherfucker, the rawest it comes
I make your body disappear, I'm a sorcerer's tongue
You live your whole life in fear that the torture will come
I hope my music is revered like a portrait of Pun
I'm paranoid god here in my fortress with guns
I had a void god, filled it with whores and with blunts
I ain't have a choice god, I was born in the slums
I ain't have a voice god till I slaughtered the drums

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Yeah, the four-fifth is a melon popper
Hollow tips spin your body like a helicopter
Anything can move god if you sell it proper
And I've been through more viewings than a teleprompter
This is horrorcore beat, got hella monsters
My team's got more Gs than a spelling proctor
Y'all ain't never moved D, y'all are petty choppers
I got a vicious left hook, call me Eddie Thomas
But I'm raw with the right hand
Like Jack Johnson fighting against the white man
Yeah I'm about to shorten your life span
Evil shit can be good if it's in the right hands
I make motherfuckers burn, you a slight tan
I keep a motherfucking urn on my nightstand
So wait your motherfucking turn like a hype man
I bury you with the snitches under the white sand

[Chorus]
143
Vinnie Paz:Aristotle's Dilemma
[Intro]

Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
'Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

[Verse 1]

Y'all motherfuckers walk around like you got a wire
My watch face the same size as a Ducati tire
Everybody hit the deck when the shotty fire
Vinnie give your team problems like I'm Stoudemire
Your fam should be ashamed of you still
This ain't a cookout but Vinnie put the flame to your grill
You claim to be real but y'all just end up painfully killed
My four-fifth is vicious, cold enough for Satan to chill
I don't give a fuck cousin, everybody can fry
Everyone could be a victim, everybody could cry
Only a real man look another dead in the eye
And tell him that he only got like twenty seconds to die
I'm slow but I realise that's my best pace
My voice raw, when I spit it crack through my chest plate
I ain't the type of motherfucker to test fate
The type of motherfucker to increase the arrest rate
Streets fucked up suffering bad, there's no kush
Motherfuckers stuck hustling skag
Yeah, same ones get stuck with the mag
Hard rock turn to rubble cause he's fucking a fag

[Chorus]

Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
'Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

Silly girl to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
'Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there

[Verse 2]

I'mma go hard till nothing is left
Till there's nothing left in the world, nothing but death
And the .38 tucked in my vest
And I stare at my guns like they're a pair of voluptuous breasts
I don't care, I'll take one in my chest
If it means seeing my father again and maybe touching his flesh
I'll walk around with thirty guns in my sweats
If it means that I'm eating and my mother eating, son of success
I see the world different than y'all
I have more determination and persistence than y'all
It's probably why I have such a resistance to y'all
It's probably why I been so much more consistent than y'all
It's business-involved, I'm everything that you could possibly dream
I'm a mathematician, I'm a vision, I'm a machine
Know what I mean? I roll with brothers pushing rock to the fiends
Roll with brothers who love their mothers, stay on top of their Deen
Louie Dogs rap harder than most
And I got something that rearrange your face and turn your pop to a ghost
You get rocked with the toast
And I make you put your hands up like people that are talking in quotes

[Chorus]
144
Vinnie Paz:WarMonger
My fist enters in your temple like an obelisk
It's blackness, darkness, abyss of joblessness
Everything you do is small, my shit is monstrous
I murder devils and any of their accomplices
My brain function on other levels of consciousness
My brain function on other levels of pompousness
You're listening to the bass and treble of godlessness
My thirty-eight will spit hate and level the populous
My esophogus breed the evil that just demolishes
Whether or not you're a believer in the Apocalypse
Y'all shit is sweeter than two faggots that's locking lips
It ain't a rapper competing with my obnoxiousness
It ain't nobody that's equal to my accomplishments
The Desert Eagle is legal and it astonishes
The AR15 diesel and blow your mom to bits
It's hard to catch me, I'm Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk

[Chorus]

Music is motivation for me to just go insane
Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged
And I'm trapped but I escaped it
By trapping in that trap for that paper

Music is motivation for me to just go insane
Man I see it on paper, I know that I should be caged
And I'm trapped but I escaped it
By trapping in that trap for that paper

[Verse 2]

Y'all know the flow is precise
You don't owe me your life
But that could change one roll of the dice
And then money try to go for his knife
I'mma levitate his body to the sky until he's homies with Christ
Don't even fuck around, son is a goon
Son is bipolar, alcoholic, son is consumed
I breathe life into the sun and the moon
I breathe life into the most barren bloodiest womb
Y'all don't know y'all getting stalked in the shower
Populism is rebellion over corporate power
Politics is just the talk of the hour
It's a matter of time before they hit another office or tower
I don't care, I put the gun to your ribs
And the Desert E big, it'll separate mothers from kids
I walked around from Philly slums to the bridge
Been around the world eighty times, nobody can fuck with the kid
Yeah
145

Violent Soho:Son Of Sam
Followin' the queue
And take your hat off
The emptiness in you
Innate fake drama

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands

Lift your hands in praise
And eat your answers
Dragged by all your curls
Happy dead laughter

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares or even understands at all

The city took my only love
The end of the line, the beat and the hum
You look so pretty in the light of the night
The only joy, the sound of her lung

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart
Sitting pretty till the world tore apart
You were the Son Of Sam
No one cares of even understands

Beautiful girl, you got a hole in your heart

I hate your photos
Your stupid sports clothes
I'm your lover
And your reject too

She's an idiot
Not illiterate
De-censored
Mute playboy

Love, love is a heavy word

Violent Soho:Outsider
With a cross between her legs
She went to say her final vow
Brushed her hair aside with oil
And in your head you made a smile

But they don't know, they don't care
They don't even understand
And they sigh while the sleep
The prayers will stay beneath their sheets

You say the universe is weak
But in your head, you bend your knees

In her eyes, you saw the highest of the highs
And all its weight
In her simple mind you grabbed to all the truths
You kept away

But they don't know, they don't care
They don't even understand
And they sigh while they sleep
The prayers will stay beneath their sheets

You say the universe is weak
But in your head you bend your knees

The suburb prayed and ate its meat
The deer smelt nice you made a wish
For it to end, for it to end

To own complete the emptiness
You wished and smiled the night away
And it was neat, you gave away
You gave away your final touch
The sky caved in and you were crushed
150
Violent Soho:Narrow Ways
Feel my heart
Skip along the odd days
I got 1600 lies
Now I'll mind my own

In your youth
You think about the exit days
I swear that I'll be there
But I won't cry for long, shut up

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Every single night the owls will get older
Keepin' me awake, the hours go longer

Taste the skin
Your father can remember
The day you walked alone
You screamed at the floor, shut up

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Drift along the narrow way
I got 1600 miles
I wanna go home, yeah

And I'll keep it in my arms
And I'll hold on it real light
The only time you cried you thought it was done

Drift along the narrow way
She don't want you anymore
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Now you are alone
Now you are alone
Now you are alone

Vivian Green:Better Man (skit)
There was a man, his paper much longer
Whose house is in order
Livin' on a whole 'nother level than you

Ain't gotta get material things from chicks
Frontin' like you get it, the credit couldn't get it
In and out the district, failed to pay child support
For your own kids and you don't even give a ish

Hey Mister, you a misfit
Once I got your digits, I got you out my system
I know your number when I discovered
Lost all respect for you as a man, forget a lover

I need you to understand
That, baby, there's a better man, better than you
What you talk, he can walk in his shoes

I need you to understand that
Baby, there's a better man who's better than you
The sad thing about it is you could be like him too

There is a man whose decisions are much wiser
Always there when I need him
Never fronts for outsiders
But you wanna be arrogant, ignorant

Do and say the worst things
Like I don't remember it
You probably won't remember this
'Cause you're selfish
You're your own worst enemy, damn, you're helpless

Take advantage of your loved ones
Baby, you're the lost one
Might win some but you just lost one
And it ain't even gotta be like that, no
I can't believe you wanna be like that, no

I need you to understand
That, baby, there's a better man, better than you
What you talk, he can walk in his shoes

I need you to understand
That, baby, there's a better man
Who's better than you
The sad thing about it is you could be

I thought that you would see me do my evolution
But I guess I'm starin' down your layers with pollution
You say I'm trash and I always put you last
Not fast and furious, I'm just young and curious

So don't blame me 'cause you tried to tame me, crazy
You know I ain't tamable, us that got inflammable
Thought I was permanent but now I'm interchangeable
Guess she wasn't right and now with all the foolish things I do

Now you say I'm the worst but I had you at first
It took a minute for you to say you was finished
It ain't your fault 'cause I did it, I pushed it over the limit
But thanks for the privilege of having you was part of my village

Umm, part of my image but I don't mean to look like
To take your heart crook tight, I'm still trying to get right
So I'm eating my spinach though I know that we're finished
I'll just do better the next relationship that I get in, get it?

I wanted to be your partner
But I couldn't go any further
Couldn't ride the tide but you passing germ
While I crashed and burned in the flame

And I can't make it change
You stringin' in a group now
When you are your own man
Is a waste of time for me
'Cause I can't make it better if you don't wanna be

I need you to understand
That, baby, there's a better man, better than you
What you talk, he can walk in his shoes

I need you to understand that
Baby, there's a better man, better than you
The sad thing about it is you could be like him too

Baby, baby, now tell me, why, why don't you wanna be better?
Why don't you wanna be better?
Yeah, ooh, baby, ooh, baby, baby, ooh
What you, what you talk, he can walk in his shoes, yeah
What you talk, he can walk in his shoes, yeah
Ooh, baby, oh, you can be a better man, a better man
Better man, better man

Vivian Green:Search Is Over
Now that I got you
Now that I got you
I don't need, no
I don't need, no

People search the world
They spend their lives, they waste their time
They keep on tryin'
Until they're all cried out and still no sign

I'm takin' it to the other side like
Waitin' in the longest line
I've been on that ride before, my heart's died before
But now I'm giving faith in this

(Ain't nobody out here to love me)
What a lovely discovery
That's standin' right
In front of me
(Search is over)

(Ain't nobody hit me like it got me)
When I get colder
You covered my shoulder
You are my soldier
(Search is over)

Lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(So tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

Ain't lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(Tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

My heart, no, it never cried
My guard's down, that's no facade
I cross over to the other side
I'm still, I've never felt so high

I wish I didn't experience the pain
To get here but I'd do it all again
Just ask me what love is
No education, I'd spend a life to learn, baby

(Ain't nobody out here to love me)
What a lovely discovery
That's standin' right
In front of me
(Search is over)

(Ain't nobody hit me like it got me)
When I get colder
You covered my shoulder
You are my soldier
(Search is over)

Lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(Tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

Ain't lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(Tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

And what would I look for
That I don't already have?
See I got all I need
There's nothing else to grab, no

When I say you got me
(You got me)
Pierced by a arrow
(You shot me)

Flyin' like a sparrow
('Cause I got weak)
(You got me)
Search is over

(Ain't nobody out here to love me)
Baby, I just can't believe
You standin' right
In front of me
(Search is over)

(Ain't nobody hit me like it got me)
When I get colder
You covered my shoulder
You are my soldier
(Search is over)

Lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(Tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

Ain't lookin', lookin', lookin' for love
Ain't lookin', lookin' for love no more
(Tell me, baby, what would I do that for?)

No, I'm not lookin' for love
Ain't lookin' for love, no
Baby, why would I?
I got you, baby
I don't need nobody, nobody, no, no, no
Ain't lookin' for love, ain't lookin' for love

Vivian Green:Jordan's Song
If I had all the time in the world
All the words in the books
Every possession to lavish you with
You still wouldn't understand

What could ever be enough
How could you comprehend my love?
The only way that you could ever see
Would be to step inside of me

La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

If you breathe every air I breathe
If you could think the thoughts I think
The only way for you to ever see
Would be to step inside of me

Wish I could protect you from everything that hurts
I wish you never had to cry a single tear
Wish you could cast every single care upon me
Wish I could change the world, you wouldn't have to see

And if I had all the time in the world
All the words in the books
Every possession to lavish you with
You still wouldn't understand

What could ever be enough
How could you comprehend my love?
The only way that you could ever see
Would be to step inside of me

La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

If you breathe every air I breathe
If you could think the thoughts I think
The only way for you to ever see
Would be to step inside of me

Every morning at sun rise, I'm inspired
To be stronger than I was the day before so I
Can watch you grow like a flower, I watered
You with love down on my knees everyday
Praying He'll make it all right

Every morning at sun rise, I'm inspired
To be stronger than I was the day before so I
Can watch you grow like a flower, I watered
You with love down on my knees everyday
Praying He'll make it all right

Every morning at sun rise, I'm inspired
To be stronger than I was the day before so I
Can watch you grow like a flower, I watered
You with love down on my knees everyday
Praying He'll make it all right

Praying He'll make it all right
Praying He'll make it all right

Vivian Green:Somewhere
Baby
Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love

I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours

I never knew love, I never knew hurt
I never cried tears, I never felt heartache
Never felt my soul was connected to another
Never felt any of this before you came

Mistakes we both made
The times that life can take
It's all over now, we won't get it back
But still I know in my heart that

Baby
Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love

I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours

I remember what you wore, remember what you said
Remember the expressions on your face
I never forgot one thing you said to me
Everything we were is in my memory

Mistakes we both made
The hurt, the love, the pain
It's all over now, we can't get it back
But still I choose to believe that

Baby, baby
Somewhere there's a place for us
Maybe not in this universe
But we were meant to be in love

I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours

Our love is not for this world
And no design of this world
And there's another place for it
Somewhere

Our love is not for this world
And no design of this world
And there's another place for it
Somewhere

Somewhere there's a place for us
Somewhere there's a place for us
Somewhere
There's another place for us somewhere

Somewhere, somewhere
(Our love is not for this world)
Somewhere, somewhere
(And no design of this world)

Baby, there's another place for us somewhere
(And there's another place for this somewhere)

I'll be free to love you somewhere
Maybe there's no space or time there
Baby, there's just you and I
There ain't ever gonna be
Never, ever be a love like ours

Vivian Green:Too Intense
Butterflies in the sky
I feel just like that
Thirty five thousand feet
I feel just like that

Skydivin', freefallin'
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

One across the first car
I feel just like that
Ferris wheel, at the top
I feel just like that

Carousel spinnin' round
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control

Got me thinkin' 'bout the future
I feel just like that
Wanna trust, lose control
I feel just like that

Apprehension out the door
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

Don't care what anybody says
I feel just like that
Let's run away together now
I feel just like that

Whatever you wanna do
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control

Tell me if you feel
(Just like that, that)
On top of the world
(Just like that, that)

Higher
Now I can get higher
Just look at me now
Nothing can bring me down

Butterflies in the sky
I feel just like that
Thirty five thousand feet
I feel just like that

Skydivin', freefallin'
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

One across the first car
I feel just like that
Ferris wheel, at the top
I feel just like that

Carousel spinnin' round
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control, baby

It's out of control
It's out of control, baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh
It's out of control, baby
It's out of control, baby

I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control

I can't catch my breath
It's too intense, tense
I need just a minute
Give me just a minute
It's out of control
This is out of control

Butterflies in the sky
I feel just like that
Thirty five thousand feet
I feel just like that

Skydivin', freefallin'
I feel just like that
I feel just like that
I feel just like that

Vivian Green:So Far Gone
I'm into you
Just like you're into me
No way we can lose
It's how we're meant to be

Lover and a best friend
I dig your energy
You're my centerpiece
Us together feels complete

My family
You treat them like your own
And I'm gone, I'm so gone
Can't find my way back home

Not that I need to go
I feel so comfortable
You give that extra
That I need to grow

And I'm so, so, so
So far gone, so far gone, ohh, ohh
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone

Yeah, he got me
(He got me)
Yes, he got me
(Yes, he got me)
Definitely, I'm so far gone

And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone

Gone, gone, oh, yeah
Gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone

(Gone, gone, gone)
Gone, gone, oh, yeah
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone

I'm in a different space
A permanent vacation
Physically, you might seen it
We don't have to change

Like I'm on cloud nine
In a better place
You put a smile on mine
Every time I see your face

We let it flow and
Didn't rush into anything
We let it grow and watched it
Blossom into many things

Baby, I just wonder
How you do it like that
'Cause you make it so easy
Just to love you right back

And I'm so, so, so
So far gone, so far gone, ohh, ohh
And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone

Yeah, he got me
(He got me)
Yes, he got me
(Yes, he got me)
Definitely, I'm so far gone

And nothin' even matters anymore
'Cause I'm so far gone
I'm gone, I'm gone

Gone, gone, oh, yeah
I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm, so gone)
Believe I'm gone

(Gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone, gone, oh, yeah
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone

I'm trapped inside your heart
Without a key, I'm tryin' to be
Baby, I don't want nobody else
Around for me

Gone like a fast lane
Gone like jet plane
Gone like I'm insane
Gone like just like yesterday

I wanna live with you all my life
You got that love, I can fall in twice
So far gone like a punch by Mike
And I'm knocked out cold and the Vegas lights

And I don't wanna wake up 'cause I got it so bad
When you're away, it feel like a break up
If we broke, together we scrape up
If we rich, forever we caked up

I see a life ain't all about
Money, high heals and make up
So I let my guard down
Even when you had your poker face up

And now the camera's can't
Spot us so they mad
So paparazzi that they
Don't need a GPS for that
We're so, yeah, we so

Gone, gone, gone, oh, yeah
(Gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)

Believe I'm gone, gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Believe I'm gone, gone, gone
(I'm so gone)
Believe I'm gone
168
Vivian Green:Save Me
He'll never yell or raise his voice to me
He's so gentle how he handles me
He loves me so different
It's amazing how he loves me

He's my Prince Charming ridin' a white horse
He rescued me, led me on a steady course
He's got love so, so different
It's amazing how he loves me

Now it's a bad dream that I'm livin' daily
It's like I'm caught up, up in this whirlwind
And I'm cryin' out, out from this nightmare
But after my sweetest dream, I wake up, I'm still here
Somebody

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me

He told me I was top priority
He even said he'd give his life for me
Whenever see me hurt, see me cry
Tell me why

Why am I cryin' every night and day?
You're someone else, split personality
It must be 'cause you hurt me
I thought you never have to

Now it's a bad dream that I'm livin' daily
It's like I'm caught up, up in this whirlwind
And I'm cryin' out, out from this nightmare
But after my sweetest dream, I wake up, I'm still here
Somebody

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me
(Save me)

Every day that I wake up is like a bad dream
This is a call of distress, somebody rescue me
I thought I could trust you, yes, I believed
But now I can see, who you really been

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me

Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody help me 'cause I can't get out
Somebody save me 'cause I keep wakin'
Somebody save me, somebody save me

Somebody help me, somebody save me

Vivian Green:I Know How&

Vivian Green:Beautiful
I don't wanna waste an entire album on you
I've been there done that, yeah
And I don't wanna tell who, what, when, where
Why and how, 'cause who cares? No-nobody cares

But I hope you soon find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I thought I could teach you
But you were more afraid, than willing

So when it comes, don't push it away
One day you will find it is the greatest gift
And I hope you don't take advantage of it again

Hold her when she wants to be held
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you
Take her to her favorite place more often than not
Don't take her kindness for weakness, 'cause I'm sure she'll love you a lot

Support her in all that she does
Don't tear her down, lift her up
'Cause that is the worst thing you can do
To someone you love

Put her high on a pedestal
And tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful

I used to think that I could not bear you to be with anyone but me
But I've been there, done that
And since then I've come to think silly of that whole mentality
I still want to find love too, though it won't be with you

I wish for everyone to one day find happiness and love
Including you, yeah
And I don't want to go into details, 'cause I've said enough
And it's not my intent to hurt you, no

But I hope you soon find out how to love
Once upon a time you wanted to learn
I thought I could teach you
But you were more afraid, than willing

So when it comes, don't push it away
One day you will find it is the greatest gift
And I hope you don't take advantage of it again

Hold her when she wants to be held
Don't yell at her when she's only trying to love you
Take her to her favorite place more often than not
Don't take her kindness for weakness, 'cause I'm sure she'll love you a lot

Support her in all that she does
Don't tear her down, lift her up
'Cause that is the worst thing you can do
To someone you love

Put her high on a pedestal
And tell her when she looks beautiful
Tell her when she looks beautiful
171
Vivian Green:One Of None
I love your eyes
And I don't remember
Lookin' into
Anyone's eyes but yours

I love your face
I love to touch it, hold it
Close to my heart
Right there, yeah

And I love your skin
The texture, complexion
Looks great against mine
I just can't stop touchin' you, touchin' you

And I love your lips
I could kiss them for hours
Upon hours
No, I don't think you understand

That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Or have I been hallucinatin'?

Did I create you in my mind?
Or maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where

I don't have all the answers
But tell me what it is I'm missin'
'Cause you can't be that perfect
Ain't nobody that perfect

No, I don't have it all together
But you can't be that perfect
So tell me what it is that I'm missin'
'Cause it's gotta be somethin'

You tell me I'm beautiful
Seems every chance you get
Never a day goes by
Without you sayin' it ten times

You adore me
The way I've always wanted
Someone to adore me
Yes, indeed

And you handle me so gently
Verbally and physically
So attentive, so generous
All the things a man should be

No, I couldn't have designed you
Any better myself
And that is why
Why I don't think you understand

That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Or have I been hallucinatin'?

Did I create you in my mind?
Or maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where

I don't have all the answers
But tell me what it is I'm missin'
'Cause you can't be that perfect
Ain't nobody that perfect

No, I don't have it all together
But you can't be that perfect
So tell me what it is that I'm missin'
'Cause it's gotta be somethin'

That you are one of none
Are you in my imagination?
Have I been hallucinatin'?

Did I create you in my mind?
Maybe I've been committed
And I don't even know where, oh, yeah

I don't know
You're too perfect, baby
Somethin's gotta be missin'
Somethin's gotta be missin'
Or maybe you're just perfect
172
Vivian Green:When We're Apart
You're not even far away
I know I'll see you soon enough
It's love to miss someone so much
It sounds so crazy but you're my baby

And I know sometimes we gotta go
I gotta hit the road, you gotta work over load
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, you're thinkin' 'bout me
I'm half of you and you're half of me

And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out but I can't help but think about you
With you and me, I only feel one thing

And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
But you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)

No, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
And you ain't even far

How I wish the time could stop so
We wouldn't waste it, nothing but patience
No more waitin' for you to come home to me
Nobody takin' the time that belongs to me

And you know that whenever I leave
With you is where I wish that I could be
(Yeah, yeah, ohh, ohh, yeah, yeah)

And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out but I can't help but think about you
With you and me, I only feel one thing

And I never thought it would be so hard
(When we're apart)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
But you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)

No, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
And you ain't even far

Ain't tryin' to complain, baby
I'm wrecking my brain
Got my cell under the pillow
Wanna see your name, come on
(Yeah, yeah, ohh, ohh, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, oh

And I don't care what nobody says
I would see you everyday if I had my way
(How I miss your face, the way your lips taste)
And you ain't even far
Who would've thought it would be so hard

And I never thought it would be so hard, ooh
(When we're apart)
I tried to block it out but I can't help but think about it
With you and me, I only feel one thing

And I never thought it would be so hard
(Never, I never knew it would be so hard)
No, I never thought it could be so hard
(Ooh, yeah, and you ain't even far)

No, you ain't even far
(You ain't even far)
So why is it so hard?
No, I never thought it would be so hard
And you ain't even far

Vulgaires Machins:Glace noire
Entre Roberval et Trois-Pistoles
Dans les odeurs de pétrole
Par ma fenêtre sale j’espionne le Québec
Ça sent le chômage et l’alcool

Je reviens chez moi la tête vide
Et le cœur rempli parce qu’hier soir
Tu as écrit sur la poussière de la remorque
Un peu d’éloges et de réconfort

Sans savoir tu as donné une raison
À cinq cents kilomètres de glace noire
Sans savoir tu as donné une raison
À cinq cents kilomètres de glace noire
195
Vulgaires Machins:L'escorte
Je suis un punk de droite
Je suis un mythomane
Je suis un démocrate
Nos fans m’appellent madame
Je suis un fusil de chasse
Je suis l’accent du Lac
Je suis le pont qui tombe
Et le médecin malade

Je n’ai jamais eu autant de mal
À réchauffer mon cœur de glace
Je suis seul et je marche parmi les morts, parmi les ombres
Tu écriras : « N’ayez plus peur ! » sur ma tombe

Je suis la trame du film
De nos vies calculées
Et la main invisible
Qui sauvera le marché
Je suis un psychopathe
Je suis l’eau de ton île
Je suis le pédophile
Qui marche autour du parc

Je sais bien, il faut marcher seul
Je sais bien, je vais mourir seul
Je n’ai jamais eu autant de mal
À réchauffer mon cœur de glace
Je suis seul et je marche parmi les morts, parmi les ombres
Tu écriras : « Je n’ai plus peur ! » sur ma tombe

Je suis l’idée d’une bombe
Je suis un irréparable
Je suis brisé par l’écueil et rassuré par le mal
Je suis le poids qui monte
Je descends la rivière morte
Je suis la mort et l’amour et le destin et ton escorte

Vulgaires Machins:Un peu plus fort
Comme une bouée au milieu de nulle part
Tu as peint le bonheur sur mes idées noires
Plutôt périr que subir tes absences
Plutôt mourir qu’accepter le silence

Comme la raison d’expliquer ma présence
Enfin un peu de lumière sur le non-sens
Tu es la plus belle mélodie du monde
Tu m’as réanimé pour l’instant

D’une seconde qui passe
Tu as masqué l’affliction
Et le désert entre nos regards
Dis-leur la haine en moi qui tombe
Donne-leur l’explication
Mets le volume un peu plus fort

Sans ta présence je m’éteins sans remords
Tu me fais tourner la terre dans le bon sens
Tu me fais pleurer pour éteindre la tourmente
Tu seras toujours le meilleur des exemples

Au-dessus des horreurs de ce monde imbécile
Toute sa folie, ses raisons, sa violence
Tous les mensonges, mon cœur qui se déchire
Je vais continuer de croire

À toutes les secondes qui passent
À lutter l’affliction
Tu me donnes le courage d’offenser encore
Tu me donnes la preuve, je n’ai pas eu tort
Tu me donnes une exception
Mets le volume un peu plus fort

Le temps d’une seconde qui passe
Pour lutter l’affliction
Et le désert entre nos regards
Dis-leur, le doute en moi est mort
Devant l’aversion
Même si la question revient encore

Est-ce qu’il faut que je vive
Ou il faut que je meure
Est-ce qu’il faut que je ris
Ou il faut que je pleure
Est-ce qu’il faut que je m’invente la lumière
Que je m’invente le bonheur
Le courage de rester et panser le malheur
J’inventerai l’impossible, j’inventerai l’impossible
198
Vulgaires Machins:Texture qui se mange
Mes pâtes sont trop cuites
Mes œufs goûtent la truite
Il y a tellement de sel
Que mes reins abdiquent
Et d’un bout à l’autre
De la Belle Province
C’est le boulevard Taschereau
Qui nous sert d’exemple

Ça me dégoûte dans mon organisme
C’est juste une texture qui se mange
Tant qu’il y a des grosses portions on est content
Du sirop de poteau, amènes-en

La vie est trop courte
La vie est trop belle
Mais comment vous faites
Pour rater l’essence
Tu t’approches de moi
Et ça y est je tremble
C’était prévu, tu me donnes
Des déchets qui se mangent

Et qui goûtent pour le moins étranges
C’est juste une texture qui se mange
Est-ce que c’est notre table qui hallucine ou il y a d’autres clients
Qui ont un pouce d’eau dans leur spag…

…Hetti
Juste une texture qui se mange
Vomi
Juste une texture qui se mange
Je t’en prie
Un cuisinier ça se change
Tu me dis
« Oui mais au moins on mange… »
199
Vulgaires Machins:Presque complet
Merci pour les distances et les contradictions
Les croyances qui triomphent sur la réflexion
Merci pour les frontières, les lignes et les règles
Merci pour la guerre, j’avais besoin de haine

Merci pour l’Histoire, un tissu de mensonges
La statue d’un fasciste coulée dans le bronze
Merci pour l’amnésie quand me revient le doute
Des idées reçues qui ont pavé ma route

Je suis presque comblé, sur le point de dormir en paix
Je suis presque complet, manque plus que ma dose de Valium
Presque comblé

Merci pour les excès, il s’agit d’être riche
Merci de mettre un prix sur tout ce qui existe
Merci pour la morale et la bienséance
Merci pour les sans-abri, j’avais besoin d’exemples

Je suis presque complet, manque plus que ma dose de Valium
Je suis presque comblé, manque plus que ma dose de calmant
Presque comblé

Je suis presque comblé, j’ai intégré l’art de l’absurde
Sur le point d’être complet, manque plus que ma dose de Valium
Pour espérer
Pour exister
Presque complet
200
Vulgaires Machins:Pointer l'orage
Je sais que tu en as assez
D’essuyer ma rage
C’est mieux de chercher la lumière
Que de pointer l’orage

Je sais qu’à première vue
Ça te semble invivable et vain
D’avoir pour seul point de vue
Une rancœur sans fin

C’est qu’au fond je cherche un peu de lumière
Une raison d’exister dans tout ce non-sens
Mais plus je comprends et moins je prospère
Et pourtant je t’aime plus que toute ma colère

Je sais que tu en as assez
De ma provocation
De ma condescendance
Et de ma dérision

Je sais de ton point de vue
Ça devient insupportable
D’avoir pour seule perspective
Un désastre inévitable

Ça te paraît étrange, ça me paraît logique
Ma raison d’exister c’est moi qui l’invente
Et plus je comprends, moins je prospère
L’amour que j’ai pour toi suffit à ma colère

Je sais que tu en a assez
D’essuyer ma rage
C’est mieux de chercher la lumière
Que de pointer l’orage

Ça te paraît étrange, ça me paraît logique
Ma raison d’exister c’est moi qui l’invente
Et plus je comprends et moins je prospère
L’amour que j’ai pour toi suffit à ma colère

L’amour que j’ai pour toi suffit à ma colère
L’amour que j’ai pour toi suffit à ma colère
201
Vulgaires Machins:Je m'excuse... Je t'aime
Tu peux laisser mon cœur s’anéantir
Dans le désert que tu sèmes
Cracher sans peine et partir
Jusqu’à nier que je saigne
Je n’avais pas besoin de ta voix
Et tant besoin de ta peau
Sauras-tu faire ton chemin de croix
Est-ce qu’il faut se tourner le dos

Je m’excuse… je t’aime
Je m’excuse… je t’aime
Je m’excuse… je t’aime

J’ai imploré le ciel, prié en vain
De ne pas me réveiller demain
Est-ce qu’il t’arrive d’avoir froid
Est-ce qu’il t’arrive d’avoir faim
Bien logé et le ventre plein
J’ai brûlé les ponts qui vont vers toi
Je chantais que la vie est laide
Et je te mentais à moi

Je m’excuse… je t’aime
Je m’excuse… je t’aime
Je m’excuse

Je m’excuse… je t’aime
Je m’excuse… je saigne
Je m’excuse… je saigne
Je m’excuse… je t’aime

Walter Schreifels:She is to Me
I don't know what to call it 
I've never seen what I see 
Spinning, magnetic dancer 
Stay close to me 
You can call her a model 
You can call her a tree 
With clouds in her branches 
She is to me 
And I can call her what I want 
Oh can't you see? 
She is to me 
I've seen plenty of sunrises 
And I know what they are 
Spinning, magnetic planets around the star 
You can call her a princess 
Sparks of nobility 
Pray the castle is open 
She is to me 
And I can draw her how I want 
Oh can't you see? 
She is to me

Walter Schreifels:Arthur Lee's Lullaby
Your little weird cleats are cool,
Rabbit tricks are for children
Pretending the beds have been made
Bills are paid in the building
Trading one situation for another
I don't know why you bother
Some people like to suffer
and blame it on their families
Far music understanding
Arthur Lee will sing you to sleep

Your roommate's OK with the same dishwashing issues arisen between us
You wash too many yourself, spread the wealth, who holds the keys to this prison
We mean us
Well ours is a show with my friend Evan
Biohazard get to heaven
Have the bread, hold the leaven
What's going on here
Is this a dream, am I dead
Serving my breakfast in bed
Tastes so real and I wasn't asking
For anything
There I was
Staring up at the big sky
Wondering when it will notice me
The one screaming, staring up waving my hands
Waving my hands

Trading one situation for another
Arthur Lee will sing you to sleep
Arthur Lee singing songs about freedom
Arthur Lee saying you set the scene, oh my
Arthur Lee singing songs about freedom
You set the scene, you don't need them

Spending your life dreaming up fantasies 
Come out of the dream and face reality 
You think you've got everything 
You've really got nothing 
Too much pressure, your mind is busting 
Watch out, don't mistake 
You lose your money its poverty's stake 
Society sucker you earned your name 
Society sucker it's just your game

Walter Schreifels:Don't Gotta Prove It
When they all come down
On the way we live
Talking down from the pulpit
Where they sit
Don't give up on a single inch
Because they want to take a mile
It's common sense
You don't got prove it to anyone
You don't got prove it to all
To all the kingmakers and their set
We might seen down
But we're not finished yet
Living a life of struggle not regret
Staying true to yourself
And you can bet
You don't got prove it to anyone
You don't got prove it to all

War Of Ages:The Fallen
The annihilation of our souls
Bring forth the last known resistance of lies
This is the re-birth of our systems failure
How quickly we crawl away from the masses
The distance has fallen, trusting in failure
How quickly we run fearing our death
You liar
Bleeding for nothing
Your healer
Dying forever
The vision is oh so clear if only we'd focus
The rising rebellion moves slowly
From reaction of fear
As the answers we're looking for begin to unveil
While death makes it's way through our lives
Leading to failure
Will we allow our fate to fade away, 
In these passing days?
Take your place at his right hand
For we alone are faithful
We are the rising rebellion of lies
No place for the weak rising
230
War Of Ages:Indecision
Confused by indecision from a broken home
Left here to find out there's nothing left
I stand alone through scattered winds untainted
By human failure reminding us what we lost
How consistently we fall without taking a breath
Watching our life pass until the day we die

Hope we can follow
Faithful, we are faithful
Lord I honor you, Lord
Closer, you bring me closer

Hopeless, the never ending hopelessness
Our last words climb to a higher point of rage
This world has fallen into sorrow through selfishness
Now we won't amount to anything
The failing art of redemption
Had become a sign that wee are not alone
Will we prove to the world of your existence?
or cower in the face of regret

War Of Ages:Collapse
We're Filled with emptiness
Re-living our mistakes
Why are you so afraid?
We never were alone

Selfish anger now plagued with a thought
Our lives or nothing else
Hearts bleed from a lifetime of pain
We're reaching for empty dreams

Endless battle of death over life
Has allowed our lives to fade
So many times I've felt like a failure
Such distance brings hopelessness

We're Filled with emptiness
Re-living our mistakes
Why are you so afraid?
We never were alone

Just an ounce of fear with a cost
Pushed us into a place of regret
We never thought we would cower
We're losing ground with integrity

Innocence can't hold a candle
To light the path we chose
Through the blood of a savior
Our death shall set us free

We're Filled with emptiness
Re-living our mistakes
Why are you so afraid?
We never were alone
233
War Of Ages:Failure
Failure to include an explanation
Our lives breathe no excuse of this
It's our fault if we don't amount to anything
How frequently we point the blame to our failures

Is this what we call freedom or liberation?
A distance far too great for words
Our focus is based off of what we say - I had it all
As actions are a footnote of the past

I wanted something real
Hoping you would stay
As our voices fade
We'll find out what this means

I hear your calling reveal your heart
When pride fades
You need no explanation 
Here's my heart and I am yours

There is no greater gift then this
Our anger flows in every breath
When man made passion starts to fade
In fear will you be standing here?

When voices fade on passion
Will your hearts still burn through failure?
234
War Of Ages:Desire
Desire is over taking me
Arousing the essence of my soul
Bow to the pressure
While tearing your life apart

Your denial causes
A simple pathetic plea
As you bow in honor and
Choke on your words

The lessons keep on coming
As desire starts to fade
As the healing hand of reason
Comes closer and closer

Will the answers still be the same?
Regardless of what it's worth
I'm holding still holding on
To the god of my mistakes

Rise from the pressures 
destroying the walls of Rome
Lies of deception 
eating away at your flesh

Fight the pain of deception
We are not alone
I Can always count on you

The lessons keep on coming
As desire starts to fade
As the healing hand of reason
Comes closer and closer

Will the answers still be the same?
Regardless of what it's worth
I'm holding still holding on
To the god of my mistakes

Fill the dying dream as your feelings begin to die
Your reason for living drowns every retreating nerve
235
War Of Ages:My Resting Place
Lord I feel I'm struggling through this battle
Long for one peaceful day that I can call my own
Anger cast out and left for dead
These lies echo with no remorse
Shadows are a content plague
A Reminder of every failure

I will lay down my soul at your feet
God I feel your calling healer, you are my healer

Worthless and filled with anger
Here's a chance to prove my worth
Surrounded, I'm surrounded
By sorrow choking the life I praise

Anger is setting in
I've lad claim and called you out
Fear starts to battle you 
With honor pumping through your veins

I will lay down my soul at your feet
God I feel your calling healer, you are my healer

I will lay down my soul at your feet
God I feel your calling healer, you are my healer
236
War Of Ages:Lack of Clarity
Self liberation of our emptiness, this proves to be
Everything I wanted
Lost inside yet it seems so clear
This all we're made for

The trials keep on rolling and holding you down
Stuck inside yourself through every moment
The battle rages on even though you're never home
I guess this is the one thing I can count on

I'm lost inside your world
Hoping that you'll save me
We're holding on to you again
And revealing, revealing what you've promised me

Our misperception of your living word has left me here
Confusion over passion
Anger builds over right and wrong
Allowing hate to build in us

I'm lost inside your world
Hoping that you'll save me
We're holding on to you again
And revealing, revealing what you've promised me
237
War Of Ages:Eternal
For what feels like a life time I stood my ground
I felt nothing could touch me until now
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall

The warrior inside me is crying out
Set your face like a flint and stand your ground
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall

Never wanted, never wished for
My failures to hold me back
The only thing worth meaning
Is falling through the cracks

Will I find what I am looking for?
My very own existence
May cost me everything

My existence is overtaking me
I'm hoping and praying for a chance to live
The undying mistakes that I've made
Has set my life apart and now I'm free

Live for something, Hope for nothing
Regardless of what it's worth
The battle for something greater
Is crawling up your back

Will I find what I am looking for?
My very own existence
May cost me everything

My existence is overtaking me
I'm hoping and praying for a chance to live
The undying mistakes that I've made
Has set my life apart and now I'm free

For what feels like a life time I stood my ground
I felt nothing could touch me until now
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall

The warrior inside me is crying out
Set your face like a flint and stand your ground
Fall, and then you watch me, Fall
238
War Of Ages:Your Betrayal
To everything I hated
An anthem built for the weak
I've wasted time on you
You've become a thought in the past
It's now become so clear, so clear
I'm not worth an ounce of your time
If I could have a moment
I'd have the strength to see this through

When you come crawling back, I'll be waiting
For now your words will fall, on deaf ears
I guess you'll have to find yourself alone
Remember me when you are ready, I'm waiting
The wounds of your betrayal run thick with blood
And beauty comes from ashes, we will rise again
The only thing I wanted, wanted was a simple request
Through every failing moment, moment
I've learned what I should be

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Was to much to ask
To much to feel

When you come crawling back, I'll be waiting
For now your words will fall, on deaf ears
I guess you'll have to find yourself alone
Remember me when you are ready, I'm waiting

Washington:One Man Band
I'm not the saviour of modern religion
Not the messiah, not a magician, I don't know why
But I was not meant for this tropical city
I drive by your house and hope you cannot see me
And I don't know why I keep coming back
Cause it's you, feels like a heart attack and

Honestly, you know how to pull the devil out of me
You act like it's so easy
You're a one man guy
A one man show
A one man band on the radio

And I'm on that stage where the moon could catch fire
We're down to the wire, we're down to the wire
We're down to the war, we're down to the war
And I've been listening to such terrible thoughts by such terrible people
And I never know who is good and who is evil
Just take what you want, what you want is what I want to give you

And honestly, you know how to pull the devil out of me
You act like it's so easy
You're a one man guy

Even though we're just holding on to what you used to know
I'm just keeping on with all my keeping on, 
I'm just practising the way it gets so strong

Washington:Fighting The Good Fight
Dearly beloved
We're all here tonight
For a similar reason
We're fighting the good fight

But the weather does keep us inside

And we haven't known him
for terribly long
But his wall is filled with the ghosts
Who are never gonna hear
And they're singing and keeping me sane
And I look out the window
When it's started to rain

So many friends
So many friends
So many friends
So many friends

And all of you people 
Are part of my soul
'Cause we are connected
Above the heart

And I don't have to see you
To know where you are
'Cause we just need some whiskey
And an out of tune guitar

So many friends
So many friends
So many friends

Dearly beloved
We're all here tonight
For a similar reason
We're fighting the good fight

Washington:80 Miles
Why do I see stars at night?
Everyone else sees the light
And how did I come this far?
I’m sure that I can’t fly

Why did you say that to me?
80 miles out on the sea
And I am built with parts of you and, you are built with parts of me

I think it’s strange that the weather doesn’t change
When you are beside me
When you are beside of me
I make my plans but they don’t stay the same
You are beside me when 
You are beside me

Oh Sailor, Oh sailor

Take the wheel
Oh sailor don’t measure how I feel

Dance around the fire
Dance around the flame
We settle on the wire
We settle on my name

Take me with you when you go, now that I know what I know, cross the waves, blow the windy tides

goes so slow

Watain:Reaping Death
There is a place beyond the dreamworlds,
Past the womb of night,
Lying in wait beyond the barriers of light,
Shunned by the living, cursed by the dead
Here's no peace, here's no peace

None within, none without
Skinned bare by daggers that never doubt
Timeless in wisdom, unbound in might,
Holy Evil!

By trembling hands concealed,
Yet by fearless ones revealed

There the blood of Abel impregnates the soil,
In which hungry darkness dwells and serpents coil,
So that plants may rise to bear the strangest fruit,
For all of ye that hunger

Higher! Higher! Come on you sons of fire!
Daughters of the black moon,
Practitioners of art most dire

Dance! Dance! In twisting, white-eyed trance,
Let us praise the flowering darkness

Brush forth across the land of Nod ye wicked ones,
Ye who wear the mark and hold the keys,
Come now, let us worship,
At the womb of blasphemies

Rivers of blood! Rivers of blood!
For the black earth's quenchless thirst,
The offering must never cease,
Until the last man has been slain
Upon the altar of Mefisto

Higher! Higher!Let's set the night on fire!
Black moon bear witness to our rite,
Beneath the devil's pyre

Unchain, Set free, the flames of the Adversary!
Scorch the earth and devour all,
That sifted from the ashes be

Hail! Hail! Thou who makes the cosmos wail!
In anguish as we fuck the world,
And sodomize the god that failed

Cain! Cain! By thy blade let all god's men be slain!
Harvest now the fruits of death and set the night aflame!

Again!
Fire!

Gather! Gather! Raise the flames for so long scattered!
For aeons cursed, yet proud we stood,
Our liberation all that mattered

It's time! It is time! The bells of Armageddon chime!
Rejoice ye now, oh hungry ones,
Harvest time has come...

Wayne Fontana / The Mindbenders:Pamela Pamela
Pamela, Pamela
Remember the days
Of inkwells and apples
And books and school plays
Where little Brer Rabbit kissed Pooh in the wood
And Fluff was the cat that sat on the rug
Oh, Pamela
I remember so well

When Laurel and Hardy were shown at the flicks
With sticky red lollies on splintery sticks
Pigtails and ribbons and crushes on miss
Secret discussions about a first kiss
But you were young
And everything was new
Impatient to do things you couldn't do
Oh, Pamela, Pamela
You started to grow
Answers to questions you wanted to know

When the rest of your childhood
Forgets as a dream
And the harshness of life
Dims those peaches and cream

When Laurel and Hardy were shown at the flicks
With sticky red lollies on splintery sticks
Pigtails and ribbons and crushes on miss
Secret discussions about a first kiss
But you were young
And everything was new
Impatient to do things you couldn't do

We Are Scientists:Rules Don't Stop
Don’t be alarmed
It’s not the end of the world
If we’re breaking the rules it’s fine
I disregard this kind of problem all the time

It’s not as if it’s gonna kill anyone
If there’s no victim then there’s no crime
Just draw another if you think we’ve crossed the line

Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Rules don’t stop me
We’ll get around it
Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Don’t stop me, don’t stop me

Although it may seem unconventional sometimes
Indiscretion is worth a try
If you just play along I promise we'll be fine

So leave your hang-ups back at the door
When you and I are down on the floor
Will you know what to do about it
You know what to do about it

Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Rules don’t stop me
We’ll get around it
Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Don’t stop me, don’t stop me

It’s not as bad as they say
If this is such a mistake
Why does it seem to make you so damn happy?
This is no time to behave
Let's both get carried away
If there’s a price to be paid
It won’t stop me

Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Rules don’t stop me
We’ll get around it
Rules don’t stop me
Forget about it
Don’t stop me, don’t stop me
They don’t stop me, they don’t stop me

These aching memories still dance around me
Spilling over everything with beauty
I see your face in everything before me
Your voice is haunting me

I belong with you now
Oh please give into me
And stay forever
Oh, Don't leave me behind

So afraid of dreaming
The story is repeating
Screaming, Monsters and Bleeding
I'm losing light in myself
Come back into me
Cause only you can save me

We Are The Fallen:I Am Only One
Memories fade into the silence
Haunting me tonight
With hopes last breath
I take this moment in 
It will be the last
When morning breaks and sunlight takes the pain away

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting 
For a life that never was
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I close my eyes
And bleed this empty heart
Of all that longs to die
When faces lie and love will falter
I'm left with only time
And time will break the dreams that take the pain away

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting 
For a love I'll never have
And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one

I'm on my own here and
No one's left to be the hero
This fairy tale got wrong 
As night will fall
My heart will die alone

Ever after never came, and I'm still waiting 
For my heart to beat again
And all the dreams I've laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become
I am only one
I am only one
I am only one

Do you see me , I stand before your eyes
here in pieces, let me in your mind
when did love fade, why are we at war,
where did we fall, where did we go wrong,
have we lost it all?

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside
Oh I without you I just feel
I just feel so alive

I can define where the well ran dry
I remember every tear I cried
memories of lies, wasted all this time
now we've lost it all

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside
Oh I without you I just feel so alive
There must be more to life
Than I just left behind
Oh I without you I just feel
I just feel so alive

I step into sunlight
fueled by rage and delight
There's no place for weakness
Ill forget your sweet kiss

Oh I let you go to feel the light outside
Oh I without you I just feel so alive
There must be more to life
Than I just left behind
Oh I without you I just feel

Watching you sleep for so long,
Knowing that I can't turn the rain into sun any more
I've given you all that I have,
Now I stand here, too scared to hold your hand.

Afraid you might wake to see
The monster that had to leave

'Cause you see the shelter as the storm
Holding wind to keep you on,
You are everything to me, this is why I have to leave,
So sleep well my angel.

Under the ash and the lies,
Something beautiful once here now dies,
And the tears burn my eyes,
As you sit there, all alone.
I just want to come home,

But you see the shelter as the storm,
Holding wind to keep you on,
You are everything to me, this is why I have to leave,

So sleep well my angel.
Sleep well, my angel.

Lose another chance to break away
From all I cannot bear.

Wishing hope would just abandon me
Till this is over.

Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.

Fear is all I hold
Bound and beaten down
All the pain I can't escape today
Is always with me

My loveless life
I'm lost in you tonight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.
My darkest night
Your arms that hold me tight
Waiting for you to turn around
Only to tear the whole world down.

All my hope is gone

All my hope is gone

Waiting for you to turn around

This night is alive with the smell of insane
Its reaching for me and its calling my name
I beg for silence to drown out their weep
How did this asylum become where I sleep

So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight
All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

So close I almost could taste my own grave
My moment of selfishness caused by your pain
Almost threw this life you gave me away
In this institution for you now I pray

So ashamed of waking
All my life you failed to keep me safe
My whole world's forsaken
Won't let you destroy my faith again

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight
All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

Forgive me
With wings adorn me
So I can fly 

All my Questions get no answers
Locked up tight from the world outside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

All my Questions have no answers
I can feel the fear inside me
Mommy come get me out tonight

There's no use in crying
All my tears won't drown my pain
Free me from your sorrow
I can't grieve you again

I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

All I did was love you
Now I hate the nightmare you've become
I can't let you fool me
I won't need you again

I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

You bury me alive,
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

Make me feel this love we used to hold
All I see is black and cold
As I try to pull you down
To the ground, the ground

Everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
You're too consumed by all your emptiness and lies

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breathe somehow
Don't leave me dying
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

There's nowhere to hide
From this nightmare calling to me
Fear in me, Stays in me

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears
All in my head again
The nightmares I might hear
All my tears pull me through hell again

The nightmares inside here
My dark fears
All in my head again
The nightmares I might hear
All my tears pull me through hell again

I can feel your fingers 
When I close my eyes
Take your poison love inside
I fall into dreaming
I've been waiting for your touch to bring me home
Sleeping death will come and lead me out of the sunlight

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight

Hating all I am when lying by your side
Taking everything of me
To leave only nothing
I hold secrets only dreaming eyes can see
Night time sanctuary seeks
The pain of the living

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight

Lay down your life
Only for you
Forsake the light
All I see is you
Forever night
Live just to die for you

Shadows pulling me to lie with you
When the moonlight sings
The darkness brings me back to die with you
I'd give it all away to be with you
My hearts waiting and breaking to return to burn with you tonight

We Are The Ocean:Look Alive
I am hoping that today I'll learn how to live my life
But I can't, can't, can't see past this crowd,
But I know, that I can feel it, yeah I can feel it.

I'm always looking for an answer, something to tell me who I am
And I'm always looking to the mirror, there's no one there so I'll pretend.

I don't want to be like everyone else,
They by the same rules, they've got it all figured out.
Follow me through the crowd right now, follow me through the crowd right now.

But I know that I can feel it, yeah I can feel it.

I'm always looking for an answer, something to tell me who I am.
And I'm always looking to the mirror, there's no one there so I'll pretend.
There's no one there so I'll pretend.

Let's all make out that we're somebody else,
Let's all make out that we're somebody else.
Let's all make out that we're somebody else,
Let's all make out that we're somebody else.

I'm always looking for an answer, something to tell me who I am.
And I'm always looking to the mirror there's no one there so I'll pretend.

I'm always looking for an answer, something to tell me who I am.
(Let's all make out that we're somebody else,
Let's all make out that we're somebody else)

We Are The Ocean:Our Days Are Numbered
Oh, this is terrifying, I'm counting down the days 'til I end up in the ground
Oh, this is terrifying, I'll keep a close eye on my time, I beg you not to end this yet

But there must be something after this, there must be something

Well, I've forgotten what it feels like to know you've got it all to come
So let's pretend, so let's pretend that we're young again

Oh, this is terrifying, I'm scared that I'll wake up one day with nothing left to do
Oh, this is terrifying, I'm trying hard to see this through without the fear that I'll die soon

I won't let it ruin the years that I have, I won't let it ruin

Well, I've forgotten what it feels like to know you've got it all to come
So let's pretend, so let's pretend that we're young again

Save your breath now, save your breath now
Save your breath now, save your breath now
266
We Are The Ocean:Don't Take Chances
Don't take chances on me
I don't think I can let you go
I'll be right here for you
(I'll be right here for you)
So just tell me and let me go
(So just tell me and let me go)
I don't think I can take it no more

I've had enough,
Forgive me if I can't hold my tongue
And I'm giving up
All I wanted was to be by your side
All I wanted was to feel alive

Go, you come and go
Will you forget, go
You come and go
Will you want to?

Have I said enough?
I'm not sure
I can't bare this hurt inside
If I kissed you
Would you know
That it's me that you want in your life
So will you please take my hands tonight

I've had enough,
Forgive me if I can't hold my tongue
And I'm giving up
All I wanted was to be by your side

We Are The Ocean:I Used To Be So Much More
"I hear the sound" she whispered softly and this is what she said
"He has come to take my sins away"

This is the worst thing that I've ever done
And now I'm asking you to clear it from my soul
How could that be, I've hurt someone that could have been me
But now I'm trying so hard to believe
This is the worst thing, this is the worst thing, this is the worst thing that I've ever done

And my heart is heavy from the pain I have
Building up my tears I can't control
And this burden on my shoulders is bearing down hard
So I'm holding out for someone to come and help me

Take me out someone, take me out so that I can reach you
I've failed once again, this is a nightmare that never ends, no it never ends
Take me out someone, take me out so that I can reach you
Take me out someone, take me out so that I can reach you

And my heart is heavy from the pain I have
Building up my tears I can't control
And this burden on my shoulders is bearing down hard
So I'm holding out for someone to come and help me

And I need a sign that you're for real (I can't help myself from playing at your knees)
And I will find it hard to disappear
Take me out someone, take me out so that I can reach you

And my heart is heavy from the pain I have
Building up my tears I can't control
And this burden on my shoulders is bearing down hard
So I'm holding out for someone to come and help me
270
We Are The Ocean:All Of This Has To End
Well all I hope is that you forgive me and understand how I feel
All I wanted to do was tell you what was true, but it had it's effects, I could tell

My heart's in broken pieces but I don't pity myself because I'm to blame
I couldn't carry on this way when all I wanted was to stay
It took it's toll on me
And I will never forget, no, I will never pretend it meant nothing to me

But you weren't the only thing here, but you weren't the only thing that mattered to me
But even when I had to go away, you were always on my mind, but that wasn't enough for you

My heart's in broken pieces, but I don't pity myself, pity myself
I couldn't carry on this way when all I wanted was to stay
It took it's toll on me, it's toll on me
And I will never forget, no, I will never pretend it meant nothing to me

All of this has to end, all of this had to end

My heart's in broken pieces but I don't pity myself because I'm to blame, yeah
I couldn't carry on this way when all I wanted was to stay
It took it's toll on me, it's toll on me
And I will never forget, no, I will never pretend it meant nothing to me

All of this has to end
It took it's toll on me
271
We Are The Ocean:This Is Called My Home
These lights, they burn my face, it's always the same in every new place
And I'll take everything I have learned and make sure you know this is something I've earned
I've waited these years just for their heads to turn

And this beat in my chest makes me know I'm blessed
The voices I hear makes me know I'm not alone
This is called my home, this is where I belong
And I'll always know where I'm from, it's this feeling that keeps me going on

With your eyes, can you see that I bear my soul with the words that I bring
And I'm scared for what could happen to me, I'm scared that the sound will eventually fade and all that is left are the minds that we made
You can't match what I'm feeling, without this I have no meaning

And this beat in my chest makes me know I'm blessed
The voices I hear makes me know I'm not alone
Oh, this is called my home, this is where I belong
And I'll always know where I'm from, it's this feeling that keeps me going on

This is called my home, this is where I belong
And I'll always know where I'm from, it's this feeling that keeps me going on
And I know this can't be wrong

This is called my home, this is where I belong
And I'll always know where I'm from, it's this feeling that keeps me going on
It's this feeling that keeps me going on

We Are The Ocean:(I'll Grab You By The) Neck of The Woods

Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know
There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know

Tonight the trees are alive
But I'm just trying to survive
But I can feel them creeping up on me
Well I take familiar strides
But don't seem to get as far
But I'm trying hard, I'm trying hard

There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know
There's no need to live in fear
Because the lights will show us were to go
The lights will show us were to go

Well I never thought that this could hurt so much, [x2]
Well I never thought, I never thought, I never thought
Well I never thought that this could hurt so much

There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know
There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know

We Have Band:How To Make Friends
What do you want?
Deep underground
Hear the mice make a sound
As they scramble around
Gathering ground
Of the seasons abound 
All the things that you found
Calvary fall
And artillery fall 
And then infantry fall
Do you think the battles won?
(When on the road)
Are the Spartans overcome?
(What did you see?)
Are they sighing in their sleep?
(Why wont you tell, tell me?)
This is not a dry run
Howl of the hound
Leaving thoughts to be proud 
Through the feet of the crowd
Deep underground
Mice make a sound
Scramble around
March as before
We are here we applaud
Want you want we adore
Do you think the battles won?
(When on the road)
Are the Spartans overcome?
(What did you see?)
Are they sighing in their sleep?
(Why wont you tell, tell me?)
This is not a dry run
(We're on a rock)
(And it's gonna roll)
Do you think the battles won?
(It gathers pace)
(It's all you stole)
Are the Spartans overcome?
(And when they rise)
(What did you see?)
Are they sighing in their sleep?
(Why wont you tell, tell me?)

We Have Band:Hear It In The Cans
We made band
With our own hands
To expand
To touch the sand
Let me hear it in the cans
Sitting down here with an empty box
(Answers for everyone)
Plug goes in the hole
(Derailed onto a final path)
Still don't know if it's going to work
Guess everyone's got a goal
(Been in these shoes? We made these shoes)
Swimming away with an idea
(What makes the ball roll?)
Pin it down
(We really really don't know)
Pin that tail on the donkey
(We were thrown together)
Pin him down to the ground
We made band
With our own hands
To expand
To touch the sand
Let me hear it in the cans
Stop and let's think for a moment
(Answers for everyone)
Where do we go from here?
(Derailed onto a final path)
All this consternation
Might just turn to fear
(Been in these shoes? We made these shoes)
Chipping away at the routine
(What makes the ball roll?)
Take it down
(We really really don't know)
Need to get some focus
Need to make some sound

We made band
With our own hands

295
We Have Band:Piano
We wanna know
What it's all about
We wanna know
Know now
We wanna know
What it's all about
Does it all add up?
When we're out of love
And you're done talking
And I'm done talking
Will we find something?
Will we find something?
296
We Have Band:Buffet
We're coming for you, we sail on a sea of hope
We'll come find you, we see by your guiding light
No other feeling, no other needed to stick with a feeling
That we'll be up close and warm with you when the day gets dark

Crossing borders as we move forwards
The swaying actions a motion circular
All upon a suspended moment
As we move close a resounding chorus rings out

That steady rhythm's the sound of our beating hearts
No other feeling, no other needed to stick with a feeling
That we'll be up close and warm with you when the day gets dark

Crossing borders as we move forwards
The swaying actions a motion circular
All upon a suspended moment
As we move close a resounding chorus rings out

Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire

Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
Come on grab it, stir up for us, we're on fire
297
We Have Band:You Came Out
You came out
And you were wasted
You went home
And turkey basted

You like jack
'Cause that's your poison
Take it down
Take it deep down

Scream and shout
1, 2, 3, 4

You can dance
So just show them
Stone cold
Or just frozen

Scream and shout

We went out
We got wasted
You went home
And turkey basted

Scream and shout

You can dance
So just show them
Stone cold
Or just frozen

Scream and shout
Scream and shout

We went out
We got wasted
You went home
And turkey basted

You like jack
And that's your poison
Take it down
Take it deep down

Weezer:I Swear It's True
It's been two and a half years now that we've been apart
I've kind of spaced out lately
Can't seem to get you out of my mind
I really miss you girl, I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true
You think i'd have given up
Found somebody new
But that girls got what you've got, I belong to you
I really miss you girl, I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Weezer:I'm A Believer
I thought love was
Only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else
But not for me
Love was out to get to me
That's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted
All my dreams

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

I thought love was
More or less a given thing
The more I gave the less
I got, oh yeah
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine
I got rain

And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her
If I tried

What's the use in trying
All you get is pain

White Wizzard:White Wizzard
The wizzard steps into the light 
White dragon standing by his side 
Dark sorcerer summoning demons 
On wings of blackest angels he shall ride 

On through the night 
Killing the light 

His sword is raised into the sky 
Thunder of the gods in on his side 
The dragon spits his fire into the night 
Sorcerer of hell will fall and die 

The wizzard screaming retribution 
Dragon spreads his wings in victory 
The darkened land now burning bright 
Surrounded in a brilliant neon light 

Into the sun 
We are as one
333
White Wizzard:Death Race
Out on desert sands
The race it shall begin
To the death and locked in
Wheels start to spin

The checkered flag will fall
As death may come to all
Mechanical beasts in battle
Road warriors to the end

The engine's thrust ‒ Into the night
Battle royal ‒ The ultimate fight
Bullets and octane start to fly
Every man but one ‒ Shall die!

Gasoline and flames
Across the sandy plains
Rockets start to fly
In the desert sky

Exploding overload
On the crimson killing road
Tonight there are no rules
In the final bloody duel

A race to the death
For the power and the glory

Road villains in black
Charging the attack
Steel beasts enraged
There's no turning back

Blades slice into skulls
The armored saint shall fall
Swinging chains and swords
A deadly free for all!
334
White Wizzard:Over the Top
On the horizon
In the killing fields
You have to fight to carry on
Look to the starlight
See your destiny
Never give up the will to be

You're gonna make it ‒ You've got the fire
Flames of your destiny ‒ Burning with desire
You've got the dreams ‒ You're burning higher
On wings of steel you soar to heights that will inspire

OVER THE TOP!
The magic in us all that will survive
The fuel that drives to keep the dream alive
Over the top

Out in the cold night
And on the darkest day
You have to fight against the grain
Look deep inside you
Find out what is real
Honesty and truth will be revealed

On the horizon
In the killing fields
You have to fight to carry on
Look to the starlight
See your destiny
Never give up the will to be

You're gonna make it ‒ You've got the fire
Flames of your destiny ‒ Burning with desire
You've got the dreams ‒ You're burning higher
On wings of steel you soar to heights that will inspire

OVER THE TOP!
The magic in us all that will survive
The fuel that drives to keep the dream alive
Over the top

White Wizzard:Iron Goddess of Vengeance
Forged in flames
Of devils fire
A bond in demons blood
Iron melts
In sun and steel
Await the crimson flood
Raining blood
Shall wash the skies
Foreseeing her return
Crushing all
False prophets' lies
The crosses start to burn

Into the sun ‒ Together as one
We shall rise to take them on
Power of night ‒ Lightning strike
Waves of fury rolling on

Truth shall prevail ‒ She will avail
Freedom from chains we are as one
Strike of the sword ‒ Dark overlord
Reflecting in electric sun

So ‒ The sun shall rise
In skies of Babylon
Vengeance in her eyes
The goddess marches on

Machine of steel
A metal god
The beast it shall return
She ‒ The devils witch
A blood bitch
For whom hells fires burn

She will come
With serpents strike
To take back Satan's crown
Demons scream
And break the chains
Shaking underground

Into the sun ‒ Together as one
We shall rise to take them on
Power of night ‒ Lightning strike
Waves of fury rolling on

Truth shall prevail ‒ She will avail
Freedom from chains we are as one
Strike of the sword ‒ Dark overlord
Reflecting in electric sun

So ‒ The sun shall rise
In skies of Babylon
Vengeance in her eyes
The goddess marches on

She is the truth that forever shall be
She is the light that will set your soul free
She is the sun setting in a crimson sea
THE GODDESS MARCHES

With her sword raised high in the sky
Riding lightning the metal gods cry
Princess of Hell ‒ Bringing the dawn
THE GODDESS MARCHES ON

She shall rise

White Wizzard:40 Deuces
Out in the city ‒ On streets of fire
I feel the power of the night
Fire and octane ‒ Leather and metal
I'm burning under neon lights

I'm shifting gears to ride the sky
My metal heart will never die
Forged in the fires of hell ‒ My pistons fly
40 deuces running high

Dark dirty women ‒ Whiskey and cold gin
Getting high and never coming down
My engines fire ‒ Fueled by desire
Like lightning striking all around

I'm shifting gears to ride the sky
My metal heart will never die
Forged in the fires of hell ‒ My pistons fly
40 deuces running high

Set 'em up and knock 'em down
Rock the night away
Deal the cards ‒ Roll the bones
Lady luck will find her way

Buy the ticket ‒ Take the ride ‒ Pedal to the floor
Gonzo lust for life ‒ Kick ass! Alive forever more!!

Out on the pavement ‒ I'm burning rubber
Good Time Overdriving to the sky

Into the sunrise ‒ I'm riding shotgun
Devil driving ‒ Never gonna die

From sea to shining sea
United in truth and destiny

Rock on and live to fly free
And you'll be...

Oh...
Fly high ‒ High in the sky
Live Free or Die!!
YEAH!
Live Free or Die

Fly the flag and fly it proud
Scream for freedom ‒ Shout it out loud!
We are the keepers of the dream

Land of the brave ‒ Home of the free
The light of lady liberty
A beacon of hope and unity

White Wizzard:Strike of the Viper
Bonded and bound ‒ We fight for metal
Brothers in arms ‒ We swing the axe
Chained armor and platinum sword
Riding on a serpent attack

Legions ‒ Of Hell
Angels ‒ Of Light
Stand ‒ Up for metal
Stand up ready to fight

Can you feel the strike of the viper
6-6-6 [2x]
Come and join the cult of the snake
Satan's calling you
Come and join the legions of Hell
Fight to keep it true!

Devil dogs and sordid sinners
Blackened whores enslave the night
Demons dance as the moon is rising
Witches dance by hells starlight

Fireballs of molten metal
Meteor flame across the sky
Rocketing to another dimension
The dark angels wings fly high

Legions ‒ Of Hell
Angels ‒ Of Light
Stand ‒ Up for metal
Stand up ready to fight

Can you feel the strike of the viper
6-6-6 [2x]
Come and join the cult of the snake
Satan's calling you
Come and join the legions of Hell
Fight to keep it true!

Wasted youth bring the rebellion
And the power of the night
Anthem of the revolution
For the light of truth we fight

Blood brothers bound together
As one we'll ride the wind
Metal soldiers marching into fire
Now the movement shall begin

White Wizzard:High Roller
Roll the dice ‒ Feelin' good tonight
Loaded and high rollin'
Blackjack gun ‒ shootin' 21
Whiskey river flowin'
Roll through town like a stone
Playin' another show
On the run ‒ A demon's son
Comin' to steal your soul!

Shooting stars blastin' through your town
Fueled by the devils fire
Light the sky ‒ Now we're gonna fly
Fills you with desire

Rollin' through the night

Good times metal blasts away
Ready to take over
In your head flames burning red
Spell taking you over

In a trance ‒ You start to dance
I'll be your star tonight
Taste my sin ‒ Crank it up to ten
Until the morning light

Shooting stars blastin' through your town
Fueled by the devils fire
Light the sky ‒ Now we're gonna fly
Fills you with desire

Come the dawn I have to go
But I'm still lovin' you
Songs entranced ‒ Deep in your mind
A spellbound witches brew

In my dreams ‒ I'll see your smile
Burnin' like a flame
I'll be back again next year
Callin' out your name

Shooting stars blastin' through your town
Fueled by the devils fire
Light the sky ‒ Now we're gonna fly
Fills you with desire

Rollin' through the night [4x]

White Wizzard:Out of Control
White Wizzard's here to rock you all
In a raging metal storm
Riding on the second wave
Of a new electric storm

Rebel souls and rivet heads
Will make the hammer fall
Break the chains and go insane
Heavy metal is the law!

Lets Go!
Hail Rock and Roll
Metallic overload
We're gonna spin your soul

Out of Control!

In '79 we were left for dead
A new movement was born
Neal Kay ‒ Saved the day
Air guitar's in a crazy swarm

Lightning strikes the same place twice
It's coming back again
The Earth will quake to make your ear ache
Now crank the amps to ten

Lets Go!
Hail Rock and Roll
Metallic overload
We're gonna spin your soul

The anthems sound a new rebirth
A sonic blast across the Earth!

Motorbikes and muscle cars
Will own the roads again
Leather spiked denim warriors
Dirty women dressed to sin

Get on your feet and march in the street
Shout at the devil proud
Storm the gates in a bloody rage
Stand up and scream out loud!
342
Whitechapel:Necromechanical
I, machine have woke to my insides exposed to others like me
These insides are not like the anatomy of what I once was

Excruciating, this pain is excruciating
I am nothing but root and uselessness in a man created hell
All my mind can think is to destroy anything in my way

The stench of death is overpowering
Though the scent is quite comforting

I'm a machine
I'm a machine of other worldly capabilities bestowed on the weak
I'm a machine, we are the nightmare that has come to life

Can it be that I am the only one believing my dreams
I'm a machine
I have reached my afterlife but I never died

Forever endowed with the stench of the Gods
I am harvesting the ones who haven't been born

This imagination is reality
This is reality
This is reality
This is reality
This is reality

I am a machine
I am a machine
343
Whitechapel:A Future Corrupt
Forced into my own psychotic prison 
The future of science bred into my blood 
The evilest of creatures wish for such empowering traits 

No one man can inherit a bloodline 
Such as this man made destructive power 

The darkest evils of the world 
Feed my youth and bathe them in depravity 
Wash their hands of this sickness that reigns in the sky 

Forced into my own psychotic prison 
The future of science bred into my blood 
The evilest of creatures wish for such empowering traits 

Gather the virgins, secure my children in their womb 
Their chastity is a waste, remove their purity 

My children at last be born into the world 
My children at last be born into the world 
My children at last be born into the world 

The impossible is now the future of your dying earth 
Even the wisest of men follow a path of failure 

It's a shame that this is what your race breeds 
Blindly following the culture you mislead 
The demise of this era is among us
344
Whitechapel:Unnerving
I am God
For I am not a man nor a machine or the highest soul of immortality
I am not you, I am not me
Yet I still control all the things that be
For I am not the fake image your eyes want to believe
But I will change the world only for the worse

There is a reason why I have you here
To overtake your mind and multiply your fear of me, God

Does this feel familiar
Does this feel familiar
I am everything you hate
I am everything you hate

For I am not the fake image your eyes want to believe
But I will change the world only for the worse

It wouldn't be a problem
To initiate the process of elimination of a planet
And the fucking hypocrites it breeds
Destroy them all

Hate will cleanse us all

The forces of good and evil are yourselves don't you see
You have made your mind believe that you couldn't exist without me
Your morals are dead
This is psychological rot at its finest form

Hate will cleanse us all
Hate will cleanse us all
I am everything you hate
I am everything you hate
345
Whitechapel:Prayer of Mockery
Open up your eyes 
Prove the point that is sworn to me 
Even blind ones see through your story 
Begin on me, O Mighty One 
Destroy me with the powers that be 

I'm still standing here 
My heart still beats a million strong 
I'm calling you out; prove to your followers that you exist 

Bring down your fury like the scriptures document 
Judge me 
Tell me that I am not worthy for you 

Rid me from this hell you've created and wipe my slate clean 
Blind me with your light as though you never wanted me to see
 
Still, I find myself waiting for the answers to come 
My patience is wearing thin once again 

Wipe my slate clean 

When the trumpet sounds your so-called Second Coming 
Am I supposed to be trembling in fear?

Wipe my slate clean 

Thou shalt not bear false witness
346
Whitechapel:Reprogrammed to Hate
Why have a plan for humanity when you haven't done anything yourself
If I were you, I'd run and hide because a beautiful darkness has arrived
The one you call Father is dead and gone; I slit his throat
Resurrected him and did it again

This bitter world is in my hands
No false, pretentiousness son of man will inhibit the structures I've devised
Beneath the clouded smoke, beneath the acid rain
The tombs of a fallen race are revived and reprogrammed to hate
Reprogrammed to hate

These drones of hell will rid the smell of putrid human failure
Man is his own worst enemy
How could you hope, how could you dream for such impossibilities
Man is his own worst enemy

What doesn't kill you makes you a victim of eternal torture
What doesn't kill you makes you a victim of infernal flames
This isn't a plea for power; it's the beginning of a revolution
The revolution of extermination, the revolution of total control

I have nothing, nothing to hide; I am the alpha and the omega
I have nothing, nothing to hide; imprisoned with no afterlife

Why have a plan for humanity when you haven't done anything yourself
If I were you, I'd run and hide because a beautiful darkness has arrived
Why have a plan for humanity when you haven't done anything yourself
If I were you, I'd run and hide
347
Whitechapel:Breeding Violence
Fuck this life 
Bereft of free will 
Once a man now a beast, an abomination 
Looking through the eyes of a mind corrupted by hypocrisy 
Now every sin I harbor inside become one with me 

Nameless 
No family to call my own 
Helpless 
Nobody to save me now 
Hopeless 
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home 
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home 

Hate, war 
Slowly becoming what I can only think about 
My dungeon reeks of all the decomposing flesh of what seems to be 
Heroes come and gone, slaughtered with no remorse 

Innocent blood I crave 
No sanity is found in me 
No sanity found 
No sanity found 

Bereft of free will
Once a man now a beast, an abomination 
Looking through the eyes of a mind corrupted by hypocrisy 
Now every sin I harbor inside become one with me 

Human flesh enters the chamber 
Emotionless, my meal a delicacy in this place 
The chamber doors close, my mind corrodes 
This seems to be a diabolical plan for extinction 

This is pure hatred 

Nameless 
No family to call my own 
Helpless 
Nobody to save me now 
Hopeless 
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home 
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home 

By the hands of an unknown lord 
I am the highest threat to the future of mortality 
This is pure fucking hatred
348
Whitechapel:End of Flesh
I am alive 
But I am dead in the world I was born into 
I am alive 
And here I stand waiting to feel something inside 

I am rotting away into a state of mind 
Altered, lethargic, bleeding from the eyes 
My joints are frozen, a sudden energy 
Jolts through my veins exorcising the demons in me 

In the blink of an eye, I have realized my location:
The place they call the underworld 
Its presence is amongst me 
The maniacal sounds haunt these grounds 
Where the strongest of men tread not 
Where Gods are reduced to slaves 
This unholy soul has birthed me again 

The bowels of hell cannot digest me 
Mother Earth, vomit me forth 

I am alive 
But I am dead in the world I was born into 
I am alive 
And here I stand waiting to feel something inside 

My salvation has run out 
Restless souls of death 
Rise with me 
If humanity's heart still beats 
Take all their lives 
And black out the skies 

In the blink of an eye 
I have realized my location: the place they call the underworld 
Its presence is amongst me
The maniacal sounds haunt these grounds 
Where the strongest of men tread not 
Where Gods are reduced to slaves 
This unholy soul has birthed me again
349
Whitechapel:Murder Sermon
Father, I have sinned
Forgive me for I don't know what to do
I have become devoid of faith
I am devoid of faith

As I mutter these words into his ear
His hypocritical eyes show me the origin of fear
Suddenly, it seems he has lost all faith 
In the one whose faulty life he helped erased
He tells me that he can make things right
I take his inverted symbol of everlasting life 
And brand it on his flesh, in between his eyes

This is a coldblooded crime, but it just feels so right
The upper hand is mine and so is his life

On this cold night, my sermon be preached before His Majesty
Now overthrown to be silenced by violence
This is not the devil's work
This is my murder sermon, proven to be real
Murder sermon
Murder sermon

On this cold night, my sermon be preached before His Majesty
Now overthrown to be silenced by violence
This is not the devil's work
This is my murder sermon, proven to be real

I cannot be changed
You're the one to blame
Stare into the face of the one you can't save
So now you've taken all you can ingest
I rip your still-beating heart from your chest
Look me in the eye as you take your last breath
I hope your soul never rests
I cannot be changed

You're the one to blame
Stare into the face of the one you can't save
350
Whitechapel:Devolver
Forever the darkness prevails
The sun has set as darkness prevails
Now we all devolve and rot in hell
These are the words of the suffering lords
Dethroned they remain, degraded as they burn

Welcome to hell, where suffering reigns
Hypocrite tongues, they speak
Wishing for death, wishing for the end
Like cowards they flee

Welcome to hell, where suffering reigns
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees

The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees

Now they pray for a savior to come
That savior is dead

This is what I long for
This is what I live for
This is what I long for
This is what I live for

They said they would return
Now their souls are all frozen in time
We have waited all our lives for this moment to come
The time has arrived
The new era has begun

This is what I long for
This is what I live for

We are the ones who detest your lies
Reverse the cycle, reduced to nothingness

Welcome to hell, where the suffering reigns
The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees

The most worthless creation of all
Has finally devolved to something beautiful
Nothing
They are obsolete
And now the creator has fell to his knees

Whitechapel:The Darkest Day of Man
Infatuated with the ignorance we all pretend to ignore
With the time and preparation, I could be a tyrant and ensure the downfall
I could easily entice you to kill everything that you love
Kill everything that you love

Your system knows it all
No secrets kept within the walls
I have the plan to bring it all down to an end

How the fuck could anyone believe the truth
When the religious fools have endless prophecies
Bring it all down to an end
I find it amusing when you think it all makes sense
I have the solution
Bring it all down to an
Bring it all down to an end

Now that I have control of you all
This situation is only getting worse

The darkest day of man is up on us all
You are all now reborn to serve your purpose well
The darkest day of man is upon us all
Now the world can rest in peace forever
352
Whitechapel:Single File to Dehumanization
We march
It seems as though years have passed since I have seen the light of day
I can hear the sounds of tortured souls begging for their life

I am forsaken
I cannot be forsaken

We march perfectly aligned to an unknown destination
Whispering among the drones becomes irrelevant

We're forsaken
Unexplainable, someone save us from— Someone save us

We are slaves to ourselves
We are slaves; there is no salvation

In this wasteland, I have nothing left
I'm a slave to myself

Sitting on the cigarette butt front porch
I could ask you "are you dead like me?"
Call me what you will, but call me again
It's true I don't talk too much

Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die

Pretty face could you make the jump with me?
I'm dying just to let things go
Do you remember the lightening storm?
It was the first time that I really felt you

Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die
Because our lips won't last forever
And that's exactly why
I'd rather live in dreams and I'd rather die

Willie Nelson:Ocean Of Diamonds
Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue

Well, I don't drink their champagne, I don't drink their wine
So if you refuse me, my poor heart will pine
And I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live, dear, you'll still hear me cry

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue

Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue

Willie Nelson:Seaman's Blues
On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long
I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong

Nights are so lonely on the ocean
To much time to dream of yesterday
If only I could carry out my notion
And hit the trail for Texas right away

On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long

I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong

I never thought I was leaving
I could get so blue out on the sea
But I'll bet you after all this grieving
Its that good old Texas soil for me

On my way to Italy from the Gulf of Mexico
Riding on a tanker, feeling mighty low
My good gal's behind me, no loving for so long
I'm going back to Texas, for that's where I belong

Willie Nelson:House Of Gold
People cheat, they steal and lie
For wealth and what that wealth will buy
But don't they know that on the judgment day
Gold and silver will melt away

And I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
When your heart's not good and true
So sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on all your knees and pray

And I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my God and doom my soul

Wiz Khalifa:Ink My Whole Body
Yeah, what up taylor gang?
Star power, Star year, you know what it is?

Ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body

Got so many tats, you can't even count 'em up
In the shop every week, I can't seem to get enough
My aunt said my skin to clean to mark it up
But I'ma ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck

I'm blowin' purp, no shirt
Windows down, screamin' cash rules, showin' off my tattoos
Hoes spazzin' when they see me
Run up on me star struck, askin' can they read me ?

See nothin' told 'em sleazy
Hear you man gotta a star tat and tried to be me
I make it look easy, people say I'm crazy
Body marked up like the walls in the 80's

Speakers scream loud like a car full of babies
Chain so sick they think my charm came with rabies
All I hear these days is, I think you goin' overboard with it
I ain't addicted I'm committed, it's wizzle man

Ink my whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body

Got stars over here, little star over there
Stars everywhere cause nigga it's star year
The name star power, my jewelry star bright
Tat on my face say I'm livin the star life

And by the way you know it's taylor gang
Soon as you see us, I'm inked up from my feet up
I keep blunts flickin', new tats itchin'
Black chuck coppin', new shit droppin'

Star power, I'm the one they call young
Body marked up like a subway in Harlem
Niggas say that's hard, white people think it's awesome
Chest, neck, tatted, whole sleeve on my arm done

Sleeve on my arm done, they say I look like tiger man
I put some lime in the swisher sweet and twist it all up
Can't wear a shirt, the bitches lift it up
I'm tattin' my body 'til I filled it all up

Ink my whole body I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body

Ink my whole body I don't give a motherfuck
Ink my, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my, whole body, I don't give a motherfuck
Ink, ink my whole body, ink, ink my whole body

Woe of Tyrants:Venom Eye
An open eye, awakened cold
On a path of ruin that once was gold
Black mountains blocking the sun

Enveloped in decay what's devoid of life
The land is barren stone tonight
The shadows screaming discourse

But you can see it in the eyes
The onyx stones, I cannot fail
Embrace the world I aimed to change

A garden looms ahead of rocky soil
With spirits swirling in a dance
There is inherent mystery in a stone unturned
Serpents feign their sleeping, covered

The sound of weeping grants relief from the sting
A method ringing
Hesitation in engaging pursuit
The eye glows red, the action ensues

Coated in mold, lungs resonate the sounds of the mire
Behold transformation alive behind these eyes

In the moment there's a time for reflection
To bathe in the pressing instants conviction
I've come to terms with the very real change
Within the tombs, the climate anew

Coated in mold, lungs resonate the sounds of the mire
Behold transformation alive behind these eyes

There's ash within the rain falling with autumn tears
The lanterns of the night burning sulfur eyes
Halting glaciers freeze, the embers dance the stars
Fusing of worlds, worlds once apart

An open eye, awakened cold
On a path of ruin that once was gold
Black mountains blocking the sun

Enveloped in decay what's devoid of life
The land is barren stone tonight
The shadows are screaming discourse

But you can see it in the eyes
The onyx stones, I cannot fail
Embrace the world I aimed to change

A garden looms ahead of rocky soil
With spirits swirling in a dance
There is inherent mystery in a stone unturned
Serpents feign their sleeping, covered

In the somber dusk
Revealed is the shadow's scheme
Silencing reason
388
Woe of Tyrants:Tempting The Wretch
Heeding the call of my resilient foes
Absorbing the sound of the melodies silent
All of my dreams turning scarlet
My screams startling allies in the pale of the moon

I'm contemplating what I've seen
The bright of the morning that survived the night
Dreams remembered in fragments

Shards of glass reflect
Shards of glass reflecting the pale of the moon
In the pale of the moon

I dance amongst damned, this dance of the dead
The melodies guiding me, playing unheard
Dead in the pale of the suffering moon

With this revelation I feel even more at the brink of risk
These things in the darkness that I cannot see nor resist
Dancing with fire, resting in the ash that coats my skin
Brings me to life again

Awaken screaming in the darkest of the night
The fire heats the sky, lifting me into a conscious nightmare
Revealing that the window's still intact, the murals not defiled
The window to the soul has not been broken

Warmth outstanding candlelight, the flicker on the wall
A better sense of the apathy in the corner of the room
The door creaks, barely heard as I shiver in my skin
The candle dancing violent now as if it somehow has heard

This is vengeance, this is beauty somehow defiled
This is the culmination of their desire to enter me

What I've seen how quickly white fades to gray
Within what fathers the wiles of the devil
A farce of this dark memory
The wiles of the devil, the wiles of the devil
Heeding the call

Now I'm a flurry spinning about the room
The glass cutting into my feet
As I embrace the fall into the floor
Descend, remember the sound of the whisper
In your ear, your ear

Now I'm a flurry spinning about the room
The glass cutting into my feet
As I embrace the fall it crumbles away
Descend, remember the sound of the whisper
In your ear

I stare at the walls alive, moving about to a beat I must resist
Refusing every advance, slipping hopeful back to sleep
My eyes shut, I sense the cold with whispers in my ear
389
Woe of Tyrants:Bloodsmear
Crashing of thunder, considering the light of the moon
Displaying barren pastures, the reach of my sight is weak
Gathering the pieces, the remains from the flood
Seeking shelter in the shadow of the rising sun

With dawn comes a new race, a race for shelter
A place to hide from the rays of truth that stripe my skin, go

Placing of hope in the last setting star
A tree providing shade, rotten fruit extends
Temptation grand, limb by limb, I ascend
My joints grow weary, I work to please the vacant

Crevice of my mind, there is work to be done tonight
The knowledge that comes with fear
The fallacy stating that the time has come
A body burning, gnashing teeth

Removing excess flesh in bulk as the fruit is poisoned
I feel it hardening in my veins, calloused
Crystallizing blood turns to tar
Slowing down my heart, the steady rhythm fading

The crack of timber underneath
Falling from the top of this diseased tree
Deeper, deeper towards the dirt
The branches scratching and bruising my skin

But they would say this inspiration is the key
There's a burn in every heart
The brazen forces invading the fortress keep
Reduce the odds and leave the children to weep

This drop of blood smears the world
Restores to beating the hearts once stone
The birth of spring defeats the cold
Devouring autumn's fall

But they would say this inspiration is the key
There's a burn in every heart

Devouring autumn's fall
390
Woe of Tyrants:Creatures Of The Mire
There is no foothold here in these miry depths
Clawed fingers scraping flesh from bone
Frantic laughter bubbling throughout
Voice strained from screaming, parched and shrill

With each breath comes an influx of my waste
Beasts sovereign, circling, searching for their feast
Their mouths foaming, sensing blood in the dirty water
It's the primal craving which prevails disgust

But how did I get here? The first of, oh, so many questions
Delayed are the angel's melodies, ensnared in this bog
But this place is familiar, the sites, the sounds, the face of the beast
Breathing mirrors reflecting me, I share in their needs

The absence of love, abundance of filth
Left to consider the familiarity of my despair
Deprived innocence, I am deserving of this place
Entitlement, I have what I've chosen
The virgin weeping, blackened eyes dripping contempt

Actions and disgraces, I have many faces here
The frowning masks of the tragedy, many faces here

With one final glare my head slips under the mud
I reach, still finding nothing which I can grab
To reach the surface again

Dimming into dark is the heart that fades away
I sink into the darkest deep
Finally I give in to the hands' touch
Embracing what they say

I submit to the nightmare of the mire
Finding solace in the choice to fall into breathing depths
Depths, depths

There is no foothold here in these miry depths
Clawed fingers scraping flesh from bone
Frantic laughter bubbling throughout
Voice strained from screaming, parched and shrill
391
Woe of Tyrants:Descendit Ad Inferos (The Harrowing Of Hell)
Free fall into black chambers
I can hear the weeping choir
I land at the gate exhausted and pained
He leaves me behind

And I view through the open door
The multitudes of those in eternal gloom
I see their faces strained in utmost fear
Staring into those fiery eyes

How did he find me?
I look around in curiosity
'Til I see footprints in the sand
Running next to a trail of tears

He came to the gateway, taking my place
Heard me crying desperation

The screaming of demons inside of the fire
Unleash upon those that will house them
Beasts turning vocal, exploding the screams
A battle that's already won

But they will find that the brightest of fires
Cannot blot out the burn of the Son
Aware of the efforts they pose being in vain
Their anger explained

He appears in the doorway
With something under His arm
A bag overflowing with sacrifice
I could never fully comprehend

No need to escape by my own strength
As I am carried away
Flight towards the heavens with Venus in mind
Strength of a second chance

The screaming of demons inside of the fire
Unleash upon those that will house them
Beasts turning vocal exploding the screams
A battle that's already won

But they will find that the brightest of fires
Cannot blot out the burn of the Son
Aware of the efforts they pose being in vain
Their anger explained

I look in His eyes with tears in my own
As He drops it in the ocean
Never to be seen again
392
Woe of Tyrants:Lightning Over Atlantis
Pushing forth, chasing fantasies
That justify euphoric dreams
Seeking better than I have ever seen
The pristine city in the crystal sea
Where the faultless dwell

There is a storm descending in a not so perfect world
Not so perfect after all
There is a storm descending in a not so perfect world
Not so perfect after all

Here they are
People screaming as the towers crumble down
Romance stifling is the storm
Lightning overhead displaying what we'll never control

Is this the best that they have found perfection
Within the walls that crumbled down?
Is this the best that they have found perfection
Within the walls that crumbled down?

With need to suffer the need for despair
To break down the common bond between
The man and this ancient earth
The search for our own perfect son

Lightning strikes the clock at the center of the town
Just as the Isle of Atlas invades
With each strike the elders wince
Their faults exposed to a swarm of angry nomads

So the scholars moved to say that this city can't fall
The scholars moved to say that this city can't fall into hell

If this was the perfect land, the depravity I've viewed within
Can't bridge the gap to justify my actions in this journey
A storm reveals the hell that dwells within a faulted pretense
Hearing from the heart

Hearing from the heart of a broken perfect man
Claiming the buildings were constructed on the sand
And the land was never fertile, the walkways never gold
His eyes slipping away

Is this the best that they have found perfection
Within the walls that crumbled down?
Is this the best that they have found perfection
Within the walls that crumbled down?
393
Woe of Tyrants:Singing Surrender
Revolving doors, the words unspoken
The walls alive, their stories ringing litmus
True valor of the soldier questioned in a time of war

Now the jury leaves, expressing righteous dignity
Scratching planks within their eyes
Without even a moment their deliberation ends
A momentary judgment of a sick and dying man

Escaping through an iron door
The boulders coming faster now
The healing hands of saints surrender
As they see the head that glows disdain
The looks of disappointment stain
The once opaque within these walls

They bring the stones
To shatter the scenes
Making flaccid sculptures form
Mere fragments remain

The gospel's wondrous beauty
Now in pieces on the floor
With the demons running rampant
In the eyes of unforgiving sons

Without hesitation
There is need for retreat
The walls are crumbling down
When they see me leave

They soak the bridge in gasoline
And we descend together

Woe of Tyrants:Threnody
Singing woe to me and my crimson needs
The shallow waters warm quickly in the sun
What a process to undivine
The season that refuses life

In the depths of the furthest reach
There's a hall to be found where the portraits scream
Each reflecting the memory of a soul I've laid to waste
A red lantern sparks a fire towards a doorway down the hall

Stepping into darkest keep
Lungs constrict the chance to breathe
The air is thick with threnody, a grief ridden hymn

As I grasp for a comets tail
A chance for passage forth, I fail
With the Venus' captivating glory out of reach

When the stars I see fail to show me what I seek
The collapsing novas' flare shows space is breathing
The brightest of the cosmos sons can't luminate the day
As the sun that sets allows their reign with power to take away

There is a heart of all which beats brilliantly, unobscured
There is a heart of all which beats brilliantly, unobscured

Tumultuous pause in time
As a great void reinstates the growing sense of urgency
A pause in time
This black hole reveals the cunning taunt of lunacy
Oh, pause in time
As the great voice reinstates the sense of lunacy

This is when vision fails, one silent apparition
This is when vision fails, hiding in awe

This humbled hand won't be renounced or slapped aside
This forged confession will be denied
This humbled hand won't be renounced or slapped aside
But this confession will be denied tonight

This is when vision fails, one silent apparition
This is when vision fails, hiding in awe

This humbled hand won't be renounced
This forged confession will be denied
Denied, denied

Write This Down:Redemption
We've made a costly mistake tonight
We Fed ourselves to the lions den
We lowered our guard and fell on our swords, and you call this a war

You've taken so much more than pride
(You've got to be kidding me..)
You've taken so much more than pride
(everything in time will burn..)

This is do or die
Look a promise in the eye
I hope to God you're comfortable enough to live a lie
This is do or die
Look a promise in the eye
I hope to God you're strong enough to live with compromise.

I watched the stars take the form of men
Look to the west, it's burning.
There's nothing left, it's quiet
Everything is gone.

We've made a costly mistake tonight
There's a heavy price for this treason
So we covered our eyes and forgot our names
And you call this a war.

You've taken so much more...

This is do or die...

I watched the stars..

What a disaster with no one at fault
Everyone screaming, 'God save us all.'

Come one courageous child
You have to trust in this
(You have to trust in this)
Fight what you've always wanted
You have to trust in this
(You have to trust in this)

If I'm the first to go, then make it quick
Then make it quick, then make it quick
We're so young, so naïve

If I'm the first to go, then make it quick
Then make it quick, then make it quick
We're so young, we're so young, so naïve

It's all for nothing, nothing at all
Liars can't be martyrs, don't you know?
Let me give it to your plain and simple
You walk a fine line, you walk a fine line
You speak of change, you speak of progress
Well I'll believe it when I see it for myself
Let me spell it out a little more clearly
You walk a fine line, you walk a fine line.

Can't you see the irony in
What you do to me?
You get so close (so close)
Make me feel so terribly alone

Can't you see the irony in
What you do to me?

If I'm the first to go, then make it quick
Then make it quick, then make it quick
We're so young, we're so young, so naïve

It's safe to say that we're heading to the crossroads
We are the galleries of the centuries
If you knew the truth, it really would've killed you
If you knew the truth, if you only knew
We've been caught up in the moment
And our beds are crowded where we sleep
I hate to say it but we're never making progress
I hate to say it, I hate to say it

Can't you see the irony in
What you do to me?
You get so close (so close)
Make me feel so terribly alone

Can't you see the irony in
What you do to me?
You get so close (so close)
Make me feel so terribly alone

There's no other name by which I am saved
I will not be afraid
To trust in Him

There's no other name by which I am saved
I will not be afraid

This is a race
To a lost cause

Write This Down:Citadel
How ferocious are we, a head full of poison,
And a pen to bleed dry, like the valley of bones.

We have gathered our sins, and soaked them in wine.
We have cheated this world, made it out with our head on our shoulders now...

Why can't we call this even?
Why do you care that I,

Would need another reason,
To tell you lies?

Keep moving like we never had a choice,
I'm burning this citadel to the ground.
Wake up as our broken bodies collide,

If we're going down, we're going down with a fight.

Keep moving on, keep dreaming on.

We we're sly as hell, and lived like the wolves,
But our crooked smiles, have disappeared.

We have gathered our sins, and soaked them in wine.
We have cheated this world, made it out with our head on our shoulders now...

Why can't we call this even?
Why do you care that I,

Would need another reason,
To tell you lies?

Keep moving like we never had a choice,
I'm burning this citadel to the ground.
Wake up as our broken bodies collide,

If we're going down, we're going down with a fight.

Keep moving on, keep dreaming on.
Keep moving on, keep dreaming on.

I fall asleep with twisted dreams,

What'd you do because I just can't seem to shake this?
I fall asleep with twisted dreams,
What'd you do because I can't move on without this?
I fall asleep with twisted dreams,

What'd you do because I just can't seem to shake this?
I fall asleep with twisted dreams,
What'd you do because I can't move on without this?

Keep moving like we never had a choice,

Write This Down:Kings And Councilors
There's a card up my sleeve,
it's a quicker solution and it's easier than honesty.
There's a look on your face,
like you've just seen a murder and you're terrified beyond belief.
You think you figured this out,
with the lights all down low and a stare that will chill the bone.
Like a halfway house,
empty your pockets unload all your failures.

Walk away like nothing happened
whispering 'it's gonna make sense in the end...
It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right?
It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right? Cover up those fair intentions,
after this we will never be the same again.
It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right?

Like an avalanche I will bring you to your knees,
and the pressure will break your bones,
silencing your screams. 

What can wash away my sins?
Nothing but the blood.
Blood for blood.

Write This Down:Hand Grenades
I'm handing over my transgressions,
My deep and dark confessions.

I'm telling you the truth, for the first time it's the truth.
And I'm well aware of consequences,
Don't give me second chances,
Do what you gotta do, do what you gotta do.

You shouldn't test me.
You caught me paying attention,
I finally figured it out.
And when your head's full,
And it's not easy to sleep,
You'll feel that heavy chill, strike you like a stone in your bed.

I'm taking all the sins I carry,
To a hidden sanctuary,
Down a spiraling cascade, through a spiraling cascade.
And when you walk through all the fences,
To every house you lived in,

You fall asleep alone, you fall asleep alone.

You shouldn't test me.
You caught me paying attention,
I finally figured it out.
And when your head's full,

And it's not easy to sleep,
You'll feel that heavy chill, strike you like a stone in your bed.

It's only natural to get ahead of ourselves.
We fight with hand grenades, because we've got nothing left.

I am a champion, survival lives in blood.
You speak of treachery, like you've got nothing to love.

You caught me paying attention,
Well I finally figured it out.

You need to be more impressive...

I can tell by the way that you're shaking,
You've seen this before, and you can't wait til it's over.
While you're scared to death, I can offer you wisdom,

Baby, we're growing up, and we're still building character.

You can call me whatever makes you...

Confident (you're gonna learn you're lesson),
But powerless (you better pay attention).

Your bravery (you thought that this was over),
Is at your expense (I never said that I was through with you).

You've got the secrets that always keep me up at night,
Distracted, distracted.

Retract the claws that you've embedded into jealousy.
It's vicious, so tasteless. 

You can call me a sinner,
You can call me a lover,
You can call me whatever makes you...

Don't make things difficult.

listen, Steven is singing to you
the pain of life you wipe away

a reason, 
that a fine gray ash shall recall these days
inquire
the serpent
to become a rag of a dream interred
you arrive
and you wave your hand as if she could care

that you can't get up or look up

without throwing up 
and it stays the same all the time

lie and wait
it could stop again

chew the corner off your mouth

You were beautiful when I loved you
my little bank robbing boy
you were beautiful when I lost you
like whip covered in pins and glue
when will it end 
oh when will it end
this sopping wet towel of stupidity
supplicated to the fawn
fold back my pajama sleeves
take a look at what I have done

Yeasayer:O.N.E
One's not enough
I won't stop till I've given you up
Clear eyed as I am, it's hard having fun
It's much easier said than it's done

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore

The room's still now when I'm lying
'Cause the well of the night has gone dry
When they asked to behave, I paid them no mind
Now I doubt if I'd have been so kind

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't 
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't 
'Cause I can't take it anymore

But I thought you should know

And it feels like being tranquilized
You know the separation kills your soul
But I won't stop falling like raindrops
Because I like it when you lose control

I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't 
'Cause I can't take it anymore

And it feels like being tranquilized
You know the separation kills your soul
But I won't stop falling like raindrops
Because I like it when you lose control

I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't 
'Cause I can't take it anymore

And it feels like being tranquilized
You know the separation kills your soul
But I won't stop falling like raindrops
Because I like it when you lose control

Yeasayer:Love Me Girl
What is she covering up?
What is she lying about?
Uh oh, she's hesitating
And she's using slow words, I know
But she's moving fast

Why is this happening now,
Why does this happen to me
All the time?

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)

Squeeze me, till I can't breathe
And lets just lie here in oblivion
I can't believe in one of us
I can't know how long
This love will last

Stay up in bed with me
Stay up and play with me
All day long

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby
(Love me girl)

Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?

Squeeze me, till I can't breathe
And let's just lie here in oblivion
I can't believe in one of us
I can't know how long
This love will last

Stay up in bed with me
Stay up and play with me
All day long

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby

Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in

I just can't justify your love
???
I'm just too scared to watch tv
Cause in the glass, static's all I see
Melted faces
And in the mirror speaking tongues
As I hear a siren travelin' by
I can't wake up, I try and I try

Everybody sugar in my bed
Everybody clouds up in my head
Everybody disastrous
Everybody all after us
Everybody everybody everybody everybody...

Everybody's talkin' 'bout me and my baby
Makin' love til the mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin' mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin'

5, 6; 5, 6

I just can't justify my thoughts
Draw symbols on the carpted parking lots
Perhaps the pollen in the air
Turns into a stapler
Poppin' pills to stay awake
But all them pills make me shake
Shiver shout and run about
But all the time I want to cry out

Everybody sugar in my bed
Everybody clouds up in my head
Everybody disastrous
Everybody all after us
Everybody everybody everybody everybody...

Everybody's talkin' 'bout me and my baby
Makin' love til the mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin' mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin'

Be my sunshine
When the dark clouds rumble
And together we can
Try to avoid trouble
And we'll run to somewhere
Where the grass grows greener
And the water's clearer
And our blood flows cleaner

Yeasayer:Grizelda
I know, I know, I know
Every hour of the day
There's a whisper inside of her brain
Telling me who to kill
Telling me who will live

I'd do what she says so I'd do what you will
I'll do what you say, now do what you will
I'd do it again
Again, again, again

(I'll love love love you again)

I know, I know, I know
Every hour you're awake
They'll be upping the price on your head
And now you're in reach
So watch where you sleep

They'll search day and night, can't forget what you did
You'll put up a fight don't regret how you lived
A means to an end
End, end, end

(I'll love love love you again)

Step inside the box
Pretend we won't, don't scream again, no

Go to sleep
We'll surely find you now
Really then

Yeasayer:Rome
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When you see me, better make a phone call
'Cause I'm a bad brained graphical fiend with no time at all
But just know that, I'll drown in sorrow
When I deposit your body in the dove coat, darlin', tomorrow

There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of

It's just a matter of time

There's no mistaking that

I'd sorta like to cross the Rubicon and battle for it

I paint my face red, but I'm wearing purple
I'm a gladiator, high-heeled, opium-fueled, in a bubble
Take, take, take, take
I take the gold plate, and silver metal
Heat it up, melt it down to a soup and help you to swallow

There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of

Even when my luck is down
I take joy in knowing that our love grows
But if my vices are a burden
Please don't let me off
Cast me from your home

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

'Cause lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I've been gone
Please don't ask me why

I turn away just when you want me
And I know that home is where you want me
There's not much for me there

Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending
I'm worth your time

(Ooh)

Yeasayer:Strange Reunions
Don't ask me for any favors
And I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisance

Ever since I was young I've been wondering this
Why we walk on eggshells 'round the holy dimwitted
And if, if your tongue slips
You might have to take to task 
At all of our hallowed institutions

Don't ask me for any favors
And I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisance

If you could laugh at yourself what difference would it make?
You could ignore dang cartoonists
And you wouldn't turn not to pray
But if distance persists
We'll preach to choirs
Raising ire where neither side
Will raise [the sign of grace]

This feud is getting old
No one is gonna be told to go along

Most of our questions have easy answers
Our only chance is let them be wrong

Don't ask me for any favors
And I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisance

Yeasayer:I Remember
I remember making love on a Sunday
Bright floating hearts in a fresh cut grass in May, woah
I remember making out on an airplane
Still afraid of flying, but with you I'd die today, woah
I remember the smell of your skin forever
Love us being stupid together, woah

You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time

I remember Monday making your eyes red
Still don't know what it is that I said, woah
I remember thinking this would never end
Even when you're gone, your eyes running through my head, woah

You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind

Yeasayer:The Children
We are children
and we'll give you trouble
if we dont like what you're doing
and we think that it is wrong.
Now we're satisfied,
but when we're not...
We are taking lives
and making drones.

The world that came from us,
it makes the child.
da da da da da
da da da da da.

We are children,
not the youth,
not kids.
It's not sound to pretend,
my friend,
this might just be the end.
Shadow life that sits outside your door
We live inside your walls
and leak through floors.

The world that came from us,
it makes the child.
da da da da da

You Me At Six:Safer To Hate Her
Too much, too much is never enough
I had you and I gave you up
No idea where my mind was for months
I woke up, I cashed in all of my luck
Walked hand and hand with your trust
And everybody was kissing on fire
And we all got burnt

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

Caught you having a laugh
Did you catch me have the last?
I've been smiling like this for days
Just to make up for my mistakes
In the dark, I watch everyone disappear
And I am beginning to let myself down
I am pushing everyone that was in, out

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

And nobody knows what it's like
To live and die on the inside
Nobody knows what it's like
To be one of a kind

When we die, do we feel alive?
When we die, do we feel alive?

It'd be safer to hate her
Than to love her and to lose her
It'd be safer to hate her all around

And nobody knows what it's like
To live and die on the inside
And nobody knows

You Me At Six:Fireworks
So this is the end of you and me
We had a good run and I'm setting you free
To do as you want, to do as you please
Without me

Remember when you were my boat and I was your sea?
Together we'd float so delicately
But that was back when we could talk about anything

'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed

Three whole words and eight letters late
And that would have worked on me yesterday
We're not the same, I wish that could change
But it can't

And I'll say your name and in the same breath
I'll say something that I'll grow to regret
So keep your hands on your chest and sing with me
That we don't wanna believe

'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're running circles in my head
And I don't know just who you are
When you're sleeping in someone else's bed

So it's true what they say
If you love someone, you should set them free
Oh, it's true what they say
When you throw it away

I don't know who you are
I don't know who you are

Oh, 'cause I don't know who you are
When you sleep with somebody else
'Cause I don't know who I am
When you're sleeping with him

It's true what they say when you throw it away

You Me At Six:Liquid Confidence
If one drink can make tonight slip my mind, then I
Should drink up so I can forget that I have lived my life
You are an example of better things to come
So I'll wait on some other escape that leads me nowhere fast
I've gotta ask

You've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you

If one can drink can make tonight slip your mind, then you
Should drink up so you can convince yourself that I'm cute
We are an example of why not to fall in love
It takes a turn, and then it hurts
More than you could dream of

When you've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you
And you've got nothing to prove
Oh, no, wait, yes you do
You wear it so well that we think it's true

You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
Here's the exits, exits, exits

You've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you

We are an example of
(Why not to fall in, why not to fall in love)
We are an example of
(Why not to fall in, why not to fall in love)

You Me At Six:Take Your Breath Away
It's worse, worse than you think,
If truth be told,
I'll tell you that you're lovesick,
I am sweet, so everybody takes a bite,
Dig in, I'm the catalyst of your demise.
Words are cheap so I'll sell you a line,
Like the way you acted that night,
Second best, is what, what you want then,
It won't cost that much, but me.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take your breath away.

Have you had, had your day?
Move close, and I'll push you away.
Play it safe,
For the sake of keeping some face,
Play it safe,
In the name of keeping your place.
Do what, what I tell you to,
With arms we'll carry this through,
Can't wait, can't wait to see you.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take, take, take.

Oh I only have eyes for you,
And it's so true.
Oh I only have eyes for you,
It's the truth, it's the truth.
So true.
So true.
So true.
So true.

And I only have eyes for you,
And I only have eyes for you.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take, take, take.

You Me At Six:Contagious Chemistry
If I could have a minute please
Then I'll bring you to your knees
This contagious chemistry is killing me

Oh, you'll never disappear
Until I give permission, dear
'Cause you're always gonna
Always be knee deep, so please

Dearest enemy, I fear that
You have just lost me along the way
Somewhere between the fake smiles
And your free drinks

Please don't smother me, I swear that
I need some room to breathe, what with you
All up, down and over me
You're not a name, you're just a face

It's contagious, so catch it

This love is dirtier than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

This'll sink lower than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

Dearest enemy
You should listen to the streets
Because they tell you all you need to know
'Bout who and what you are

No smoke without a fire
With that, I'll name drop you a liar
This suit of skin and bones
You've known all along, it's exactly what you are

It's contagious, so catch it

This love is dirtier than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

This'll sink lower than you think
Don't believe your eyes
Believe your ears, trust me

This is the first and the last time, I swear
There's more where that came from, she said
Do you know what that means?
'Cause I know what that means

This is the first and the last time, I swear
It's a numbers game and you were there
Do you know what this means?
'Cause we know what this means

No, oh, who did you think I was? Yeah
No, oh, is he the only lead you were working on?
No, oh, and you were caught with the best, yeah

And oh, forget the rest
Hotel rooms, cheap thrill dress
Lack of common sense
Could make this happen

If I could have a minute please
Then I'll bring you to your knees
This contagious, contagious chemistry

Dearest enemy
You should have never trusted me
You bitch
489
You Me At Six:Playing The Blame Game
You're not on my list of things to do
'Cause I've already done you
And I'm protective, it's so cute
But only when it suits you
Is this all in vain?
Can these words explain?

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
You've got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough

At least you'll have nice thoughts of me
When I'm cheating on you in your dreams
I told you before, my closet's clean
And that these bones don't belong to me
Try this one for size
Try me one more time
You hold me down
By keeping me around

Desperate minds mean desperate measures
We got to get this one together
You're young and in love
That should be enough [x2]

You hold me down
By keeping me around
No one takes me home
And No one takes me home [x2]

You Me At Six:Stay With Me
You've got a lot to say
For the one that walked away
I give, you take
It's the way it's always been

Oh, how do I know
If I should stay or just go?
The bottom line is this way
That I'll never know

Stay with me
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me, oh

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

You've got a lot to say
For the one that pushed me away
I give, you take
Some things, they never change
Just change

Stay with me
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me

I never knew

That I could be this way
I never knew
(Stay with me)
That I could walk away

These things take time to grow
It's been said that time heals woes
But no, I won't be controlled
And so the story goes

Stay with me
(Stay with me, stay with me)
Stay with me

And now I know
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
That I can be this way
And now I know
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
That I can walk away

You Me At Six:Hard To Swallow
Is this hard to swallow
You keep your thoughts by your pillow
Just so you can adore them
Just so we can ignore them
I'd rather lead not follow,
I'd rather stay and not go home
My moves have got so old
or so I've been told
But now you've lost it all

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

Forgetting the promises you make,
Is how your, your promises easily break
Oh, you sit on your fence
And I'll dig under it
I'll count my losses
And I'll count my sins
I hope you've cleared your mind

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We were young and we were blind
We ignored the warning signs
How were we to know?
How were we to know?

We were close but still so far
We grew apart and out of touch
All I wanted was...
All I wanted was to say...

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?

We're running out of time
We've got things on our mind
And things we just don't like
Who do you want to see?
Who do you want to be tonight?
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Young Rebel Set:Won't Get Up Again
There is a ghost upon my lips
Of which whose taste I can't resist
To call upon each time I miss
That touch of grace that I long to feel again

Is there something I don't realize?
A hides behind that bed of lies
That calls me back down to my knees
That holds me down and won't let me up again

'Cause I've been here 3 times before
To pick my heart up off the floor
And I don't think I can take one more
And I sure as hell won't go, go back there again

Even as I try to shake these shackles from my arms
Everything about this should be ringing bells
Alarm saying don't go back there
Don't get mixed up, don't get knotted down

'Cause you won't get up again
Move yourself into the eyes of all those lovers
You despise then you can say with an open heart
That you got knocked down but got straight back up again

Carry me, not your arms
Until those silent bells alarm
Of which your eyes can not disguise
You will always woe that the next days sun will rise

Impossible is just a word
The most ridiculous I've heard
To leave your lips up to this date
Lets give it all up and leave it up to fate

ZPU:5 Razones
Dinero, por el baila el globo y el perro,
y el amigo se echará a un lado y volverá por donde vino,
el único camino de vuelta no será mi camerino, será
el beso del padrino, un asesino a oscuras que vendrá a mi entierro
y me encierro, el dinero es dios, lo veo en sus ojos,
el brillo, la traición, el paulatino gesto de atención que buscan,
la brusca reacción del que se ofusca, 
cuando el alma es de color papel la piel también se quema y se chamusca,
su destierro, el error es cuando al interior lo mueven el hierro y el bronze
entonces ya no hay quien lo reconduzca, 
surca el mundo donde el oro es negro y todo tiene un precio
alli donde veo que amor y el amor al dinero se bifurcan
dame TIEMPO, lo quieren para hacer nada,
lo usan, se escusan tras él,
papá se escuda si llega tarde del burdel,
el tiempo, descubre la verdad, lo pone todo en su lugar,
el tiempo es el único elemento que nos puede curar,
mirad, es oro, es relativo, es esquivo, el ser vivo lo envidia,
lo aceptamos, lidiamos, si lo malgastamos nos fastidia,
es el espacio entre recuerdos, es la cordura que nos ata,
es lo que siempre quisimos matar, y es el tiempo que nos mata,
el AMOR, el unico digno es el propio
y hay que hacer acopio de él,
y reservarlo, no enseñarlo, es necesario
la primera es hostil, un ápice de ser ruín
la magia es la ignorancia de no saber que va a tener fin,
amar es saltar de un trampolín desconociendo que hay debajo,
el amor es la amistad sin trabajo, un pedazo de cielo en abrazo,
un flechazo, un coñazo, un plazo de tiempo y espacio,
donde al final el rechazo, te va a doler como un balazo.

Lo que cuesta, dicen creer en tu FAMILIA es una apuesta segura, 
lo único seguro es que no hay una apuesta sin duda,
que la figura de papá se desfigura,
cuando a mamá su cara desfigura,
que las demencias tiran el amor a la basura,
que no hay mas pura lealtad que un hermano que escuda,
los golpes de una mano vacía, a la vez que desnuda,
como el alma que los inflinge,
el llanto quiere escapar y se acumula en la laringe,
y uno se debe hacer adulto a los quince,
la SALUD, es la mentira que te llevarás al ataúd,
la esclavitud de tus impulsos para evitar la decrepitud,
¿y tu? sueña en la eterna juventud como si la parca no existiera
pero es la única exactitud certera, de la vida entera, altera,
gente con la actitud de que es la longitud lo que impera,
y no cuentan con hacer algo que les llene,
y no solo llenar la nevera,
salud es la virtud del que no morir espera,
y para mi dios no lo quiera,
entera, la vida es tan corta, y absurda y absorta,
y dolorda, y desborda a mi persona, ¿y que mas verá entonces?
si solo hay fatiga en seguir sueños que quizás no consiga,
y me siento una hormiga si miro hacia arriba, esa es mi garantía,
de que al fin un día moría, y escapaba con el tiempo,
y si lo pienso quizá vuelva en un recuerdo,
y dime, ¿es triste? se que estar vivo es relativo con tener o no que irse,
pues solo si alguien piensa en uno, uno existe.

We are the Industry people

With this death kiss
Choose needs over me
Put your lips to my fist
And now this in eclipse

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

Blind your eyes
Bow your head
A swollen halo
Of your own hell
Face yourself
Chosen one
No matter what you've said
Or what you've done

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

With this death kiss
Choose needs over me
Put your lips to my fist
And now this in eclipse

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

Blind your eyes

Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

The black curtains fall
Owe it all to violence
Please
Send my apologies

Oh, let the black curtains fall
Standing tall
Assemble and tease
Electropolis

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

Zeromancer:Virgin Ring
Want it 
More than you want it

More than you want it

More than you want it
Want it 
More than it hurts in here

I'm not afraid, no
No, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid, no
I'm not afraid anymore

The virgin ring
The 'I want' syndrome
The modern lies
The future fear
Will you suffer
When you're there

You know it hurts
You know it hurts in here

I'm not afraid, no
No, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid, no
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid this time
I'll toe the line

This kingdom
You were given
A number
My silence holds thunder

Can't hold it
Much longer
I'm breathing the fire
You are under

Zeromancer:The Pygmalion Effect
Motherfuckers and gentlemen
One in a million times
You get closer to something
Closer to something
You get closer and it slips away, yeah

Fading three dimensional ways
While flies buzzing around your head
I see you ghost-pale
Sucking up
To the black laced mirrors
Much like a sapphire

Wind-up angels
Wind-up gods
Wind-up big shots
And wind-up dolls
Aren't we all the same
On borrowed time here

The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me
Sinistar

You're in a place you cannot escape
Oh well
It's your ninth circle of hell
Torn up inside
All torn up inside
It's your shadow and a great big L

The sapphire

The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me
The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me

Zeromancer:The Hate Alphabet
Try to imagine how it feels to me

It's gonna be a lovely day
To get this hatred out of the way

(A) It's so easy 
(B) It's so easy
(C) It's so easy
H-A-T-E

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I have my own way with a to z
My heart's an ashtray
Tearing a hole
Inside of me

It's so easy
It's so easy
H-A-T-E

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I'm falling through the net
You're trying to block the holes
And I'm falling deep this time
Swap places
Change the roles

H-A-T-E
I am my own worst enemy

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I'm falling through the net
You're trying to block the holes
And I'm falling deep this time
Swap places

Zeromancer:V
I don't want to be blind
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
It's a guilt thing
It's a blood drive
The final kiss 
How this world can rescue us

Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself

I don't want to be blind (blind)
Don't want to be vain (vain)
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
I don't want to be vile (vile) 
Don't want to admit
I don't want you to treat me like shit

Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself

Taking the "one" out of "one love" 
How come it feels so numb?
Taking the "two" out of "together"
Put the "N" back in "ever"

I don't want to bleed
I don't want to forget what I feel

Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself
Help me, god, I can't control myself 
Help me, god, I can't control myself

Taking the "one" out of "one love"
How come it feels so wrong?
Taking the "two" out of "together"
Put the "N" back in "ever"

It's a guilt thing
It's a blood drive

The final kiss of this world
Of this world

Taking the "third" out of your "act"
How come I don't react?
Taking the "four" out of "forever"
Put the "N" back in "ever"

Zeromancer:The Plinth
You say it's the isolation
Wrench yourself apart this time
I will draw the line for you
I will draw the line for you

You say it's your fixation
You say it's the only way
Lay you down on a plinth
Now the sky is taking a black tint
Lay you down on a plinth
Now the sky is taking a black tint

I cut you loose 
I'm coming back
And I run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

Let's say it's the isolation
That will break the fall for you
That will break the fall for you

I cut you lose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

I cut you lose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

I cut you loose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

It's the sound of you
Closing out the world again
Lay you down on the plinth
Closing out the world again

Zeromancer:Revengefuck
What you feel when the violence burns
The feathers in black you're holding in back
What you feel is a violent play
Before you undress let me confess

Everyone I've had is in you
And when I fuck you
I fuck them all

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Thrust by thrust

now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it

This temptation swallows you up
Spiraling you down to a different place
This temptation swallows you up
Spiraling you down to a different place

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Thrust by thrust by thrust

What you feel when the violence burns
The feathers in black you're holding it back
Would the ghost grace a devil inside
With a kiss you couldn't resist

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away

Revenge fuck
Revenge fuck

Zeromancer:The Death Of Romance
You bruise so easily love
Our heart's racing again
Once the bloom leaves the rose
All that's left is regret and sorrow

Don't be a stranger
Misanthrope
Don't take my hand 
If you know you'll never love again

It's the death of romance
The death of romance
The death of romance
It's the death of romance

The rope's too tight around my hands
I don't want to understand
Obscured by light, a stain inside
Even your tattooed cross
Is too heavy to bear

Angels sing that closing hymn to me
Can't you hear
Those angels sing the closing hymn to me

It's the death of romance
The death of romance
The death of romance
It's the death of romance

It's the death of you and me
It's not the end you see
Well patience got to pay
The price tonight

It's the death of romance
Death of romance
523
Zeromancer:Mint
I let you breathe in this emptiness
See me as I am
You know the answer
Long before it's given

You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this now

The sun, the sea, the sky
The loneliness, the why
The fear of losing everything
In a goodbye
The colors in the air
The hollowness, a tear
The depths of your mistakes
Are drawing near

Now the air gets thin the walls are closing in
I didn't realize just how alone I am until now
So I'm staring at you across the room
But hey, it's not like it's the first time
The ground has fallen away

Is there any way to make this hold
Through the wind and through the cold
Then show me
Show me
Is there a line you're willing to cross
Through the rain and through this loss
Then show me
Show me

You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this now
524
Zeromancer:Murder Sound
Look at you now
Regroup 
All dead inside
You can't feel your own touch
Or the ones you want

(And when will you learn that)
My heart can't take this?
(And when will you know that)
My heart can't take this?

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Resent yourself 
Don't talk
Got you paranoid
Admit the passion 
Admit the boy
You're here to destroy

And when will you learn that 
My heart can't take this?
And when will you know that 
My heart can't take this?

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Ah ah

And when will you know that my heart can't take this?

Out loud

All dead inside
And I'm dead inside

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Oh you kill me when you say it
Oh you kill me when you say it

Zeromancer:2.6.25
{spoken}

A person climaxes when they die
(Today I will marry my prince)
So he had the gun in his hand and he told her
(Wedding vows continue in background)
He said now "When you start to reach your climax tell me when"
As soon as she started reaching her climax
She told him "Ok now"
And when she said now, he took the gun to his head
Bang
She sucked the blood from his mouth and it was warm
And she said it was just too much
That I should try it sometime

Zombie Girl:The Darkness (Darker Mix)
All alone, flesh and bone, evil carved in stone
Smell the fear
Somewhere up in these hills awaits the darkest chills
Can you hear?

Where are you gonna go?
There's nowhere to go now
Trapped in this world, you're lost forever

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you
There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

In this place, in this time and space
Fear, hate, and evil awaits you
Soon the siren will reign, better run from the pain
Before the darkness will eat you

Go, Go, Get away now
Go, Go, Run away now
Go, Go, Get away now
Go, Go..Go

Where are you gonna go?
There's nowhere to go now
Trapped in this world, you're lost forever

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

There's nobody here to save you
There's nobody near to hear you

When the sun goes down here
And darkness falls
The blanket of winter

To calm the storm
Shaking with an instinct
Just to stay warm

Chorus:
But I'd walk through the snow barefoot
If you'd open up your door
I'd walk through the snow barefoot

You hear the howling
Of dogs and wind
Stirring up the secrets
That are frozen within

The ice will haunt you
It lays so deep
Locking up inside you
The dreams that you keep

This wind ... through my soul ... blows cold

So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me, and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love

the bird and the bee:Maneater
She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you 
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see 
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed 
By the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love 
You ain't gonna get too far

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man, and 
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

Whoa, oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Whoa, oh, here she comes

You can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move

They're watching you
Watching you

Watching you

You play with words 
You play with love
You can twist it around 
Baby that ain't enough
'Cause girl I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in or 
Letting me go
Don't lie 
When you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Watching you

Why you try to put up a front for me
I'm a spy but on your side you see
Slip on, into any disguise

I'm tired of playing on the team
It seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score

Oh oh I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh yeah, you've got to understand baby
Time out is what I'm here for

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that 
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow 

You can't tell me you don't miss me girl
I think I might know you too well 
Wonder what you'd say if you knew that I was coming tonight
Want to? I want you can't you tell 

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that 
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow 
That's all you need to know now

'Cause if it's really right there's nothing else
One on one I want to play that game tonight...

the bird and the bee:Sara Smile
Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you're watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you, and me, forever

Sara, smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
If you want to be free, you know, all you got to do is say so
And when you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you, and me, forever

Won't you smile a while for me?

the bird and the bee:I'm Into Something Good
Woke up this morning feeling fine
There's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new boy in the neighborhood
Oh yeah 
Something tells I'm into something good

He's the kind of boy who's not too shy
And I cant help but tell him he's my guy
He danced close to me like I hoped he would
Something tells me I'm into something good

We only danced for a minute or two
But then be stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be falling in love
He's everything I've been dreaming of 

He walked me home and he held my hand 
I knew it couldn't just a one night stand
And he asked to see me next week
And I told him I could
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good

He walked me home and he held my hand 
I knew it couldn't just a one night stand
And he asked to see me next week
And I told him I could
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good
Something tells me I'm into something good

the bird and the bee:She's Gone
Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me, yeah
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me

Sorry, Charlie, for the imposition
I think I got (it got it), I got the strength to carry on, yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh, what will be

She's gone, she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

Get up in the morning, look in the mirror
I'm worn as a toothbrush hanging in the stand, yeah
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken a toll on me

She's gone, she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, and she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
Oh why, what went wrong?

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away, yeah
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was (was) to me

She's gone, she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone 
Oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, and she's gone
Oh I, what went wrong?

She's gone
Oh I, I better learn how to face that
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone
Oh I, I I better learn how to face that
She's gone, she's gone
I can't believe that she's gone
Oh I, I pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone

the bird and the bee:Heard It On The Radio
When we first met, it wasn't what you said
And still I loved you like mad, I loved you like mad
When we first met, they were playing that song
And then it stuck into my head, stuck into my head
When we first kissed, it made it to my list
And I couldn't stop myself, think of nothing else
When we parked the car, they were playing that song
And we turned it up to ten and started up again

(and) Every time I hear it playing
I think of you and those summer days
Oh, I can still remember
When I heard it on the radio
Oh, but now we are September
Come on, forget what we know

When you broke my heart, there was nothing you could say
And still I loved you like mad, I loved you like mad
Now that I think back, it wasn't what we had
They were just playing that song, made it last so long

(and) Every time I hear it playing
I think of you and those summer days
Oh, I can still remember
When I heard it on the radio
Oh, but now we are September
Come on, forget what we know

the bird and the bee:Rich Girl
You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money 
You can rely on the old man's money 
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far 
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway 
Say money money but it won't get you too far, 
Get you too far 

And don't you know, don't you know 
That it's wrong to take what is given you 
So far gone, on your own 
You can get along if you try to be strong 
But you'll never be strong 

'Cause
You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money

It's a bitch girl and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Get you too far 

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far

the bird and the bee:Kiss On My List
My friends wonder why I call you all the time
What can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right (All right)
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want (What I want)
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I'll only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

(I really miss you, girl)

Ahh...

(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life, my babe
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss...

tobyMac:Start Somewhere
Last night, everything was movin' so fast
I could barely keep track
Of my offenses or your defenses
In hindsight, I woulda, coulda, shoulda not gone there
But left without a word to spare
Was it your offenses or my defensiveness?
That's got me thinkin' that we're never gonna get it right
I wanna straighten this before the sun goes down tonight
If I could only fight the bitterness I feel inside
This thing is eatin' me alive
Well I'm right here
And you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
'Cause I'm messed up
And you're broken
And those shots we fired are still smokin'
I'm tossin' and turnin' on the things I'd undo
As I wrestle with the painful truth
My sleep escapes me as guilt berates me
Exhausted, the memories are drawing so near
I can see it like a world premiere
When did my objective lose all objectiveness?
If I need you, and you need me
How can you turn your back and just leave me?
When I'm right here, and you're right there
And God knows we've got to start somewhere
I said some things that I regret
And if I could, I'd take 'em back
If I could turn my words around
You wouldn't hear a sound
But here I am, and there you are
The space betwee n us is not so far
I'm reaching out my hand in love
Before the fading sun, forgive me for what I've done
565
tobyMac:Hey Devil
She dialed him about 6:00 PM 
She checked her hair in the mirror 
And she stepped through the door like this 
Three flights down 
And she's out on the streets 
Walking brick sidewalks lined in grey concrete 

He saw her coming from a few blocks away 
Red scarf in the wind as it started to rain a bit 
Shuffled down the boulevard 
Cut me like a deck of cards 
I thought you had me 
You thought that you had me 

But hey, Devil, go on 
Get your junk out of here 
I don't need you 
I don't need you 
Hey, Devil, go on 
Get your junk out of here 
I don't need you 
So move on 

I stepped to it like I knew what I was doing 
I'm a moth 
You're the flame 
Never knew you'd be my ruin 
In the blink of an eye 
Element of surprise 
Got my feet on the earth 
But my face to the sky 

Shuffled down the boulevard 
Cut me like a deck of cards 
I thought you had me 
You thought you had me 
Now the plot is thickening 
Pushing deep under my skin 
I thought you had me 
You that that you had me 

You're a beauty and A beast 
You're the pressure never cease 
You're the straight other side 
And they say you never sleep
566
tobyMac:Captured
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
I'm Your prisoner by choice
I will rest at Your feet
And I'll only lift my voice
When You want me to sing
It's the beauty of Your covering that's stealing my heart
And it's the mystery of You that tears me apart
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
And if I should get a peaceful sleep
I wanna wake at my Father's feet
All I wanna do is get into You
You got me captured (By Your love)
All I wanna do is stay here with You
You got me raptured (Can't get enough)
Let's go
The sun's on the rise
The sleep's in my eyes
The dew's on the ground
The night is disguised
There's hope in the air
I'm fresh off a prayer
The blue mountain bean is clearin' my stare
I make recompense
It's all makin' sense
Like blood in my veins
You're my sustenance
The moment of trust
The "me" becomes "us"
The "we" become "one"
Your gift is my gust of wind
'Til we meet again
So faith, don't fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it pound
So faith, don't fail me now
So faith, don't fail me now
If you touch my heart
You can feel it poundin'
So faith, don't fail me now
So faith, don't fail me now
When I touch my heart
I can feel it pound
Gotta get myself up off this ground
Faith, don't fail me now
You got me, and You won't let go
567
tobyMac:Get Back Up
You turned away when I looked you in the eye
And hesitated when I asked if you were alright
Seems like you're fighting for your life
But why, oh, why?

Wide awake in the middle of your nightmare
You saw it comin' but it hit you outta nowhere
And there's always scars
When you fall that far

We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late to get back up again
And one day you gonna shine again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

Lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever
(May be knocked down but not out forever)

You rolled out at the dawning of the day
Heart racin' as you make your little get-away
It feels like you've been runnin' all your life
But why, oh, why?

So you pulled away from the love that would've been there
And start believin' that your situation's unfair
But there's always scars
When you fall that far

We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late to get back up again
And one day you gonna shine again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

Lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever
(May be knocked down but not out forever)

This is love callin', love callin'
Out to the broken
This is love callin'

This is love callin', love callin'
Out to the broken
This is love callin'

This is love callin', love callin'
I am so broken
This is love callin', love callin'

We lose our way, we get back up again
It's never too late
You may be knocked down but not out forever

We lose our way, we get back up again
So get up, get up, you gonna shine again
It's never too late to get back up again
You may be knocked down but not out forever

This is love callin', love callin'
(Lose our way, we get back up again)
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
(It's never too late)
(You may be knocked down but not out forever)

This is love callin' love callin'
(Lose our way, we get back up again)
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
(It's never too late)
(You may be knocked down but not out forever)

This is love callin', love callin'
Out to the broken
This is love callin'
